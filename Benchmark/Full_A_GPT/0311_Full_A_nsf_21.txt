To illustrate how time off overlaps with plans around the user research within the context of the NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative project, a detailed sequence diagram is needed. This specific scenario involves several actors, including the Team Member requesting time off, the Project Manager (who oversees scheduling and allocations), and potentially other systems or actors such as the User Research Coordinator (who handles the specifics of the user research plan) and a Calendar System for scheduling.

Please note, sequence diagrams are primarily used for representing how different components in a system interact with each other over time for a specific use case. The requested scenario is more about resource and schedule management rather than software component interaction. However, I will create a simplified and conceptual sequence diagram to represent the required interaction in PlantUML format focusing on the sequence of communications around the time-off request and user research planning.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Team Member" as TM
actor "Project Manager" as PM
actor "User Research Coordinator" as URC
database "Calendar System" as CS

== Time Off Request ==
TM -> PM : Request time off
PM -> CS : Check team schedule
alt Time off overlaps with user research
    CS --> PM : Notify about overlap
    PM -> URC : Consult on reshuffling user research tasks
    URC -> PM : Propose new schedule
    PM -> CS : Update team schedule
    CS --> PM : Confirmation
    PM -> TM : Inform about the overlap and new schedule
else Time off does not overlap
    CS --> PM : No overlap
    PM -> TM : Approve time off
end

== Adjusted User Research Planning ==
URC -> PM : Adjusted user research plan
PM -> CS : Update user research schedule
CS --> URC : Confirmation

This sequence begins with the "Team Member" making a time-off request to the "Project Manager," who then checks the overall team schedule in the "Calendar System" to identify any conflicts. If the requested time off overlaps with planned user research activities, the Project Manager consults with the "User Research Coordinator" to understand the implications and explore rescheduling options. The proposed changes are communicated back to the "Calendar System" to reschedule user research activities and ensure all team members are updated with the new plans. 

Keep in mind, this diagram simplifies the complexity of managing schedules and activities within a project. In real-world scenarios, additional considerations such as project timelines, dependencies, and stakeholder communications would also need to be managed.

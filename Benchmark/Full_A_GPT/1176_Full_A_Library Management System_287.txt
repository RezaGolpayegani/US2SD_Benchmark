Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to see the book list" involves outlining the specific interactions between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) when a library member requests to view the book list. Here's a representation of this process in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Member
participant FrontendInterface
participant BackendController
participant Database

Member -> FrontendInterface : Request to view book list
activate FrontendInterface

FrontendInterface -> BackendController : Fetch book list
activate BackendController

BackendController -> Database : Query available books
activate Database

Database -> BackendController : Return book data
deactivate Database

BackendController -> FrontendInterface : Provide book data
deactivate BackendController

FrontendInterface -> Member : Display book list
deactivate FrontendInterface

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Member (library user) initiating a request to view the book list through the Frontend Interface. The request is then relayed to the Backend Controller, which handles the logic of fetching the requested information. The Backend Controller makes a query to the Database to get data on all available books. Once the Database responds with the book data, this information is sent back through the Backend Controller to the Frontend Interface, which then presents the book list to the Member.

This diagram assumes a simplified interaction flow focusing on the main components involved in the view book list request handling: the Member (user role), Frontend Interface (user interface), Backend Controller (server-side logic), and Database (data storage and retrieval). Depending on the specifics of the CLMS implementation, additional steps or components (like authentication, caching layers, or specific microservices for book information) could also be involved.

Given the complexity of describing a full sequence diagram for the detailed user story within the constraints of a text response, below is an approximation of what a PlantUML sequence diagram might look like. This example aims to describe a basic process where an app developer attempts to deploy an application that includes creating a dataset, with a focus on tolerating existing datasets if their properties are different but deemed compatible.

This representation simplifies interactions among components like the Dataset Management System (which would handle dataset version control and compatibility checks), the App Deployment Service, and potentially a Dataset Compatibility Service if we abstract out the compatibility checking logic.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme amiga

participant AppDeveloper as AD
participant AppDeploymentService as ADS
participant DatasetManagementSystem as DMS
participant DatasetCompatibilityService as DCS

AD -> ADS : deployApplication(includes Dataset)
ADS -> DMS : requestDatasetCreation(datasetInfo)
DMS -> DMS : checkIfDatasetExists(datasetInfo)
alt Dataset Exists
    DMS -> DCS : checkCompatibility(existingDatasetInfo, newDatasetInfo)
    DCS -> DCS : evaluatePropertiesCompatibility()
    alt Properties are Compatible
        DCS --> DMS : CompatibilityConfirmed
        DMS -> DMS : updateDatasetReference()
        DMS --> ADS : DatasetDeploymentSkipped(compatible)
    else Properties are Incompatible
        DCS --> DMS : CompatibilityIssueDetected
        DMS --> ADS : DatasetDeploymentFailed(incompatible properties)
    end
else Dataset Does Not Exist
    DMS -> DMS : createNewDatasetInstance(datasetInfo)
    DMS --> ADS : DatasetCreatedSuccessfully
end
ADS --> AD : DeploymentOutcome(Result)

**Explanation:**

- **AppDeveloper (AD)**: Initiates the deployment which includes creating a dataset.
- **AppDeploymentService (ADS)**: Responsible for handling application deployment requests. It communicates with the Dataset Management System (DMS) to manage dataset creation or update as part of the deployment process.
- **DatasetManagementSystem (DMS)**: Checks for the existence of the requested dataset and, depending on its existence and the compatibility of properties, decides whether to skip deployment, update references, or fail the deployment.
- **DatasetCompatibilityService (DCS)**: This optional component abstracts the logic for checking dataset properties compatibility. It evaluates whether the existing and new dataset's properties are compatible and returns the result to the DMS.

In the sequence diagram, the process starts with the app developer deploying an application that includes creating a dataset. The AppDeploymentService makes a request to the DatasetManagementSystem to create the dataset. The DMS first checks if the dataset already exists. If so, it evaluates the properties' compatibility (possibly through a dedicated service) and based on the outcome, decides whether to skip deployment, update dataset references, or fail the deployment due to incompatible properties. If the dataset does not exist, it gets created. Finally, the outcome of the deployment process is communicated back to the app developer.

Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As an agency user, I want to use the schema v1.1 headers in my FABS file" involves illustrating the interactions between the user and the system components involved in processing a FABS file using the updated schema v1.1 headers. Below is a Plant UML code snippet that outlines this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AgencyUser as User
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Validation Service" as Validation
participant "Database" as DB
participant "FABS Processor" as Processor
participant "Historical Data Loader" as Loader

User -> UI : Upload FABS file with v1.1 headers
UI -> Validation : Validate file format and headers
alt Validation Success
    Validation --> UI : File validation successful
    UI -> Processor : Process FABS file
    Processor -> DB : Update submission with v1.1 data
    DB --> Processor : Confirmation
    Processor --> UI : FABS file processed successfully
    UI -> User : Display success message
else Validation Failure
    Validation --> UI : Error in file format/headers
    UI -> User : Display error message
end
User -> UI : Request submission status
UI -> DB : Query submission status
DB --> UI : Return status
UI --> User : Display submission status

User -> Loader : Request loading of historical data
Loader -> DB : Load historical data with correct FREC derivations
DB --> Loader : Confirmation
Loader --> User : Historical data loaded

This sequence diagram starts with the agency user uploading a FABS file through the UI Interface of the broker platform. The file is then validated for the correct format and headers matching schema v1.1 by the Validation Service. If validation passes, the process continues to the FABS Processor, which updates the submission in the Database with data from the v1.1 headers. The user is informed of the success through the UI Interface.

If validation fails, the user is immediately notified of the error in the file format or headers.

Additionally, the user can request the submission status, which is retrieved from the Database by the UI Interface and displayed to the user. The agency user can also request the loading of historical data, which involves the Historical Data Loader interacting with the Database to ensure historical FABS data is loaded with the correct FREC derivations, followed by a confirmation to the user.

Please adjust the entities and interactions as necessary based on the specifics of your platform's architecture and processes.

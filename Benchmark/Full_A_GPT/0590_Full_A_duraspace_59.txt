To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a DAMS manager, I want to present collections, objects, and object components by title", we'll encapsulate the core interactions among the different entities in the DIMS system that allows for efficient retrieval and display of titles. This sequence diagram assumes a simplified flow where a DAMS manager triggers a search or listing action, the system processes the request, retrieves data from the database, and finally presents it to the DAMS manager.

Here's how you could represent this in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant DAMSManager as DM
participant DIMSInterface as DI
participant SearchModule as SM
participant Database as DB

DM -> DI : Request to display titles
DI -> SM : Initiate search/list titles
SM -> DB : Query titles
DB -> SM : Return title data
SM -> DI : Process data
DI -> DM : Display titles

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram captures the following interactions:
1. The DAMS manager (DM) initiates the request to display collections, objects, and object components by title through the DIMS interface (DI).
2. The DIMS interface forwards this request to the SearchModule (SM), which is responsible for handling search operations and listing items based on specific criteriaâ€”in this case, by title.
3. The SearchModule queries the database (DB) for titles of collections, objects, and object components.
4. The database returns the requested title data to the SearchModule.
5. The SearchModule processes this data, potentially involving sorting or filtering based on predefined criteria or user specifications.
6. Finally, the processed data is sent back to the DIMS interface, which presents the titles to the DAMS manager.

This representation simplifies many of the underlying complexities, such as authentication, error handling, and the specifics of data presentation (e.g., pagination, hierarchies of collections/objects). In a real-world application, these aspects would also need to be considered and potentially depicted in more detailed or additional sequence diagrams.

To create a sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format, consider the following steps that an app developer might go through to share a previously deployed dataset type with others in the application ecosystem. This diagram outlines interactions between the app developer, the advanced dataset management system, and potentially other systems or stakeholders involved in the process.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant AppDeveloper as developer
participant "Dataset Management\nSystem" as DMS
participant "Dataset Repository" as Repo
participant "Other Applications" as Apps

== Share a Previously Deployed Dataset Type ==
developer -> DMS : Request to share dataset type
activate DMS

DMS -> Repo : Check dataset type exists
activate Repo
Repo -> DMS : Dataset type details
deactivate Repo

DMS -> Repo : Mark dataset type as shared
activate Repo
Repo -> DMS : Confirmation
deactivate Repo

DMS -> Apps : Notify available shared dataset type
activate Apps
Apps --> DMS : Acknowledge
deactivate Apps

DMS -> developer : Share successful
deactivate DMS

```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **App Developer Requests to Share Dataset Type**: The app developer initiates the process by requesting to share a previously deployed dataset type with the advanced dataset management system (DMS).

2. **Check Dataset Type Exists**: The DMS checks if the specified dataset type exists within the dataset repository.

3. **Mark Dataset Type as Shared**: If the dataset type exists, the DMS marks the dataset type as shared in the dataset repository.

4. **Notify Other Applications**: The DMS then notifies other applications within the ecosystem about the availability of the newly shared dataset type, facilitating its potential use across different applications.

5. **Acknowledgement to Developer**: Finally, the DMS confirms to the app developer that the dataset type has been successfully shared.

This sequence diagram provides a simplified view of the interactions involved in sharing a previously deployed dataset type within an application ecosystem, as described by the project description and user story requirements.

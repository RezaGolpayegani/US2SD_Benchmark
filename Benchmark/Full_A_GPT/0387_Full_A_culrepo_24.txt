Below, you will find a PlantUML source code that corresponds to a sequence diagram for the user story: "As a faculty member, I want to upload my scholarly work to the repository, so that I can have a persistent URL that can be used for my personal web page and CV."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as FM
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Content Management" as CM
participant "Storage System" as SS
participant "Metadata Service" as MS
participant "Persistent URL Service" as PURL

== Authentication ==
FM -> UI: Access repository upload feature
UI -> Auth: Authenticate user
Auth --> UI: Confirmation
UI --> FM: Show upload page

== Uploading Process ==
FM -> UI: Upload scholarly work
UI -> CM: Process upload request
CM -> SS: Store file
SS --> CM: Confirm storage
CM -> MS: Create/Update metadata
MS --> CM: Metadata ID
CM -> PURL: Generate persistent URL
PURL --> CM: Persistent URL
CM --> UI: Show success message with URL
UI -> FM: Display persistent URL

To use this source code:

1. You need to copy the entire code.
2. Go to a PlantUML editor or use an integration/plugin within a documentation or diagram tool that supports PlantUML.
3. Paste the code into the editor.
4. Most editors should automatically render the sequence diagram. If not, there might be a button to generate or refresh the diagram.

This sequence diagram outlines the process steps starting from the faculty member's intention to upload their scholarly work up to the point where they receive a persistent URL that can be used for their personal webpage and CV. It includes interactions with a user interface, authentication service for verifying the user's identity, a content management subsystem for handling the upload and metadata processing, a storage system for physically storing the work, and a service dedicated to generating and managing persistent URLs.

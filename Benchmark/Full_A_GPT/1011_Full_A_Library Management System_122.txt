Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format involves showing the interactions between the system components and the user (in this case, the library manager) for managing subscriber profiles and subscriptions. Below is a basic outline of such a sequence in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Manager" as manager
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Profile Management" as profile
participant "Subscription Management" as subscription
participant "Database" as db

== Keeping Track of Subscriber Profiles and Subscriptions ==

manager -> ui : Logs into the system
ui -> auth : Validates credentials
auth -> manager : Provides access to system

manager -> ui : Selects 'Manage Subscriptions'
ui -> profile : Fetch user list
db -> profile : Return list of users
profile -> ui : Display users

manager -> ui : Selects a subscriber profile
ui -> db : Fetch subscriber details and subscription status
db -> ui : Return subscriber details and subscription status
ui -> manager : Display subscriber details and subscription status

manager -> ui : Updates subscription details
ui -> subscription : Process subscription update
subscription -> db : Update subscriber record
db -> subscription : Confirm update success
subscription -> ui : Notify update success
ui -> manager : Display update confirmation

This diagram outlines the process a library manager would follow to keep track of subscriber profiles and subscriptions using the Comprehensive Library Management System. The steps include:

1. The manager logs into the system through a user interface (UI).
2. The authentication system validates the manager's credentials.
3. Upon successful login, the manager accesses the manage subscriptions feature.
4. The system fetches and displays a list of user profiles from the database.
5. The manager selects a subscriber profile to view details and subscription status.
6. The system fetches and displays the selected subscriber's details and current subscription status.
7. The manager can update subscription details as needed.
8. The system processes and confirms the update, notifying the manager of success.

This sequence can be further detailed or modified based on specific system design and requirements, such as handling errors or incorporating additional functionalities like renewing or upgrading subscriptions directly.

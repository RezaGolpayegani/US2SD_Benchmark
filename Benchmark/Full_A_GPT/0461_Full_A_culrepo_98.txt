Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described scenario involves illustrating the interactions between the Asset Manager and various components of the Digital Repository System, with a focus on redundancy and backup processes. Since you requested a PlantUML format, below is a representation of how this interaction might occur in the context of the Comprehensive Digital Repository System for Cornell University.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "Asset Manager" as Manager
participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Repository Backend" as Backend
participant "Storage Management" as Storage
database "Primary Storage" as Primary
database "Backup Storage" as Backup

== Deposit Digital Copy ==
Manager -> WebUI: Deposit digital copy
WebUI -> Backend: Request to store digital copy
Backend -> Storage: Process storage with redundancy
Storage -> Primary: Store in primary storage
activate Primary
Primary --> Storage: Confirmation
deactivate Primary
Storage -> Backup: Initiate redundant backup
activate Backup
Backup --> Storage: Backup confirmation
deactivate Backup
Storage --> Backend: Storage successful
Backend -> WebUI: Display success message
WebUI -> Manager: Confirm digital copy stored with redundancy

== Retrieve Digital Copy on Damage ==
Manager -> WebUI: Request access to damaged digital copy
WebUI -> Backend: Lookup digital copy
Backend -> Storage: Check primary storage
alt Primary Storage Damaged
  Storage -> Backup: Retrieve from backup
  Backup --> Storage: Return backup copy
  Storage -> Primary: Restore backup copy
  Primary --> Storage: Restoration confirmation
  Storage --> Backend: Provide restored copy
else Primary Storage Intact
  Storage -> Primary: Access digital copy
  Primary --> Storage: Return digital copy
  Storage --> Backend: Provide digital copy
end
Backend -> WebUI: Serve requested digital copy
WebUI -> Manager: Download digital copy

### Explanation:

1. **Deposit Digital Copy**: When the Asset Manager decides to deposit a digital copy, they interact with the Web Interface. This action triggers a series of backend processes that ensure the digital copy is not only stored in the primary storage but also redundantly backed up in a separate backup storage system. This sequence is critical to guaranteeing the safety and redundancy of deposited digital copies.

2. **Retrieve Digital Copy on Damage**: If an Asset Manager discovers that a digital copy in the primary storage has suffered damage or unwanted changes, they can request access to this digital copy. The system then verifies the integrity of the primary storage. If the primary storage is compromised, the system fetches the backup copy, restores it to the primary storage, and then provides access to the Asset Manager. If the primary storage remains intact, the system simply fetches and delivers the digital copy directly.

This sequence diagram outlines the essential interactions and processes involved in ensuring the redundancy of storage for digital copies, addressing the Asset Manager's need for a robust and reliable digital repository system.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram specifically tailored to the user story you've shared involves depicting an interaction scenario between multiple system components and stakeholders (e.g., researchers and institutional repository/CRIS systems) centered around the DMPTool. Note that the exact sequence and components might vary depending on the specific implementation details of the DMPTool and the institutional repository/Current Research Information System (CRIS) you're considering. Here's a simplified version to get started, highlighting an idealized data flow when a researcher wants to record research publications linked with DMP records in an institutional repository or CRIS for report generation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "DMPTool" as DMP
database "Institutional Repository or CRIS" as Repo
participant "Reporting Module" as Report

Researcher -> DMP: Log in
Researcher -> DMP: Navigate to project DMP
DMP -> DMP: Fetch DMP record details
Researcher -> DMP: Select "Add Publication"
Researcher -> DMP: Enter publication details
DMP -> Repo: Check if publication is in Repo
alt publication not in Repo
  DMP -> Repo: Add publication to Repo
  Repo -> DMP: Confirm publication added
else publication exists
  DMP -> Repo: Update publication record
  Repo -> DMP: Confirm publication updated
end
DMP -> Repo: Link publication with DMP record
Repo -> DMP: Confirm linkage
Researcher -> DMP: Request research output report
DMP -> Repo: Fetch all publications linked to DMP
Repo -> DMP: Return publications data
DMP -> Report: Generate report based on publications
Report -> DMP: Report generated
DMP -> Researcher: Display/download report

To use this PlantUML diagram:

1. **Setup**: You need a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor.
2. **Code**: Copy and paste the above code into the PlantUML editor.
3. **Generation**: Run the PlantUML process to generate the diagram.

This sequence diagram illustrates the process steps from the researcher's action to log into the DMPTool and navigate to their project DMP record, through adding or updating a publication in the institutional repository or CRIS based on the DMP record, linking the publication to the DMP record, and finally requesting and receiving a report of research outputs from the project.

Keep in mind, this is a simplification and a conceptional approach; your specific requirements, systems' APIs, and data flow might necessitate adjustments.

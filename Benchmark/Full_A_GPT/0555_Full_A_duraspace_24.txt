Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between different system components or objects when a repository online manager wants to indicate any license pertinent to an object within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS). Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as UI
participant "License Management Module" as LMM
participant "Database" as DB

RM -> UI : Access License Management option
activate UI
UI -> LMM : Request to indicate license for an object
activate LMM
LMM -> DB : Fetch object details
activate DB
DB --> LMM : Object details
deactivate DB
LMM --> UI : Display object and current license details
deactivate LMM
UI --> RM : Show object and license options
deactivate UI
RM -> UI : Selects/Enters new license details
activate UI
UI -> LMM : Update license details for object
activate LMM
LMM -> DB : Save new license details
activate DB
DB --> LMM : Confirmation of update
deactivate DB
LMM --> UI : Display confirmation message
deactivate LMM
UI --> RM : Show confirmation message
deactivate UI
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Repository Manager accessing the License Management option in the DIMS interface. The process includes fetching object details, displaying these along with current license details, allowing the Repository Manager to select or enter new license details, and then saving these details in the database with a confirmation message being displayed to the Repository Manager at the end.

Please note, to render this UML diagram, you would need to use a UML diagram tool that supports PlantUML syntax, like the official PlantUML web server, or integrations available in various development tools.

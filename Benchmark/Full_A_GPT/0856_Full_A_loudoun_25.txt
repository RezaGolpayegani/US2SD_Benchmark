Given your request to generate a PlantUML sequence diagram for the described user story, I'll illustrate a basic example of how a zoning staff member might process requests for zoning information and communicate with the applicant through the system. This example assumes a simplified interaction flow for clarity.

Let's create a sequence diagram for the following actions:

1. The zoning staff member receives a request for zoning information from the applicant.
2. The zoning staff reviews the request in the system.
3. The zoning staff captures their response to the request in the system.
4. The system sends a communication (e.g., email or system message) to the applicant with the staff's response.

Here's a basic PlantUML code snippet to represent these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Applicant as A
participant "County Services \n& Property Information Portal" as CSP
participant "Zoning Staff Member" as ZSM
participant "System Messaging Service" as SMS

== Request for Zoning Information ==
A -> CSP : Submit Request for Zoning Information
CSP -> ZSM : Notify of Zoning Information Request
activate ZSM

== Review and Response ==
ZSM -> CSP : Review Request
ZSM -> CSP : Capture Response in System
deactivate ZSM
CSP -> SMS : Prepare Communication to Applicant
SMS -> A : Send Response to Applicant

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the applicant submitting a request for zoning information to the County Services & Property Information Portal. The portal then notifies the zoning staff member of this request. The zoning staff member engages by reviewing the request and capturing their response in the system. Once the response is captured, the system sends a communication to the applicant through the system messaging service, which could be an internal system message, an email, or another form of communication.

To render this diagram, you need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML code.

Remember, this is a basic outline. Depending on the system's complexity, additional steps like authentication, logging, error handling, or more detailed interactions (e.g., how responses are formulated or how messages are customized) might be necessary for a fully implemented system.

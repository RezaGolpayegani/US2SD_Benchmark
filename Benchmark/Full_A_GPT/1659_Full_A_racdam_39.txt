Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves outlining the interaction between the researcher, the system components, and the digital archive for downloading a file. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "File Access Control" as FileAccess
participant "File Management System" as FileManager
participant "Digital Archive" as Archive

Researcher -> Web : Request download for a file
Web -> Auth : Validate researcher credentials
Auth -> Web : Credentials valid

alt if credentials are valid
    Web -> FileAccess : Check access rights for the file
    FileAccess -> FileManager : Request file for download if access allowed
    FileManager -> Archive : Retrieve requested file
    Archive -> FileManager : File data
    FileManager -> Web : Provide download link
    Web -> Researcher : Show download link
else if credentials are invalid or access denied
    Web -> Researcher : Show error message(access denied or login required)
end

This sequence diagram shows the basic sequence of interactions for a researcher attempting to download a file from a digital archive without having to visit the readingKA room physically. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Researcher Initiates Request:** The researcher makes a request to download a file through the web interface.
2. **Authenticate Researcher:** The web interface asks the authentication system to validate the researcher's credentials.
3. **Credentials Validation:** The authentication system checks the credentials and, if valid, allows the process to continue.
4. **Access Rights Check:** The web interface then requests the file access control system to verify if the researcher has the rights to access and download the requested file.
5. **File Retrieval Attempt:** If access is granted, the file management system is asked to retrieve the requested file from the digital archive.
6. **File Transfer:** The digital archive provides the requested file to the file management system, which in turn makes the file available for the researcher to download, typically by providing a download link.
7. **Error Handling:** If at any point the process fails (e.g., invalid credentials or insufficient access rights), the researcher is informed through an error message.

Note that this sequence diagram simplifies some steps for clarity and focuses on the major interactions relevant to the user story. Implementing such functionality in a real project would require addressing additional considerations such as secure connections, error handling in more detail, and likely more complex interactions with back-end systems.

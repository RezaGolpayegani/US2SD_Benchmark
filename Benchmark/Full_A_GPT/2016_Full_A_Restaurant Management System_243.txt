Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a restaurant manager wants to enter the selling price of menu items involves showcasing the interaction between the manager, user interface (UI), backend services, and the database. Below is a PlantUML code that describes this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "UI: Web Application" as UI
participant "Backend Service: MenuManagement" as B
database "DB: MenuDatabase" as DB

M -> UI : Access Menu Management
UI -> B : Request current menu items
B -> DB : Query menu items
DB --> B : Return menu items
B --> UI : Display menu items
M -> UI : Select item to update price
UI -> B : Send item ID and new price
B -> DB : Update item price in database
DB --> B : Confirm price update
B --> UI : Confirm update to manager
UI --> M : Display update confirmation
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Manager (restaurant manager) accessing the Menu Management section of the Web Application (UI). The Backend Service (MenuManagement) retrieves and displays current menu items from the MenuDatabase (DB). The Manager selects an item to update the price, and this new price is sent to the MenuManagement backend, which updates the price in the MenuDatabase. The database confirms the update, and the backend service communicates this confirmation back to the UI, which then confirms to the Manager that the price update was successful.

To visualize this PlantUML diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML environment (like an online editor, IDE plugin, or standalone software that supports PlantUML). This code aims to encapsulate the process flow as per the user story in the project description for a restaurant management system.

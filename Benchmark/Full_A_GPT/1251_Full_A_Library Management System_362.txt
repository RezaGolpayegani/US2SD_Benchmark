Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story: "As a student, I want to be able to search for a specific author," using PlantUML involves detailing the interactions between the system components and the user to achieve the desired outcome. Given the complexity of a Library Management System (LMS), the sequence will outline the process from the user's request to the system's response providing the relevant book details associated with the specific author.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Search Controller" as Controller
database "Library Database" as DB

Student -> Web: Enter author name
Web -> Controller: Request books by author
Controller -> DB: Query books by specified author
DB --> Controller: Return query results
Controller --> Web: Display book results
Web --> Student: Show books by author

```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Student**: The user (student) initiates the sequence by entering the name of an author they wish to search for.

2. **Web Interface (Web)**: The front-end interface where the student inputs their request. This component captures the input and sends the search request to the system's backend, specifically to the Search Controller.

3. **Search Controller (Controller)**: Acts as the intermediary that processes input from the front end. It handles the logic needed to fetch the relevant book data associated with the specified author. It formulates a query to search the database based on the author's name.

4. **Library Database (DB)**: The repository where all the library's data is stored, including books, authors, categories, user data, etc. It processes the query from the Search Controller and returns the relevant book details that match the author search criteria.

5. **Communication Back to the Student**: Once the Search Controller receives the query results from the Library Database, it forwards the information to the Web Interface, which then displays the list of books by the specified author to the student.

This sequence ensures that the student can effectively search for books by a specific author through the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), demonstrating a core functionality of the system that enhances the user's experience and access to information.

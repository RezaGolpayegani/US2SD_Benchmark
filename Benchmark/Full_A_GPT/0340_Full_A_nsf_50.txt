To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story mentioned, let's break down the tasks and interactions that are likely involved in the process of identifying interview participants for user research. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines these interactions systematically.

Please note, due to the nature of text environment here, I am simplifying the visualization of steps without diving into specific technical interactions like API calls or database queries. The focus will be on the workflow from the perspective of a user researcher aiming to identify interview participants:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "User Researcher" as researcher
entity "Research Participant Database" as database
entity "Research Recruitment Tool" as recruitmentTool
actor "Educators and Science Influencers" as participants

researcher -> recruitmentTool : Identify criteria for participants
recruitmentTool -> database : Query potential participants
database -> recruitmentTool : Return list of potential participants
researcher <- recruitmentTool : Review list of participants
researcher -> recruitmentTool : Select potential interviewees
recruitmentTool -> participants : Send invitation for interview
participants -> recruitmentTool : Respond to invitation
recruitmentTool -> researcher : Report responses (accept/decline)
researcher -> recruitmentTool : Schedule interviews with acceptees
recruitmentTool -> participants : Confirm interview schedule
participants -> recruitmentTool : Confirm attendance
recruitmentTool -> researcher : Finalize list of interview participants

Explanation of Steps:
1. **Identify criteria for participants**: The User Researcher defines what criteria participants need to meet (e.g., educators, science influencers).
2. **Query potential participants**: The Research Recruitment Tool queries the Research Participant Database for potential participants that meet the criteria.
3. **Review list of participants**: The User Researcher reviews the list of potential participants provided by the Recruitment Tool.
4. **Select potential interviewees**: From the reviewed list, the User Researcher selects a set of potential interviewees.
5. **Send invitation for interview**: The Recruitment Tool sends out invitations to the selected potential interviewees.
6. **Respond to invitation**: The participants (Educators and Science Influencers) respond to the interview invitation, indicating whether they accept or decline.
7. **Report responses**: The Recruitment Tool reports the responses back to the User Researcher, indicating who has accepted or declined the invitation.
8. **Schedule interviews with acceptees**: The User Researcher uses the Recruitment Tool to schedule interviews with those who have accepted.
9. **Confirm interview schedule & attendance**: The Recruitment Tool sends out confirmation of the interview schedule to the participants, and participants confirm their attendance.
10. **Finalize list of interview participants**: The User Researcher finalizes the list of interview participants based on the confirmed attendees.

This sequence diagram describes a process flow that can be adapted or expanded based on specific project needs or tools available.

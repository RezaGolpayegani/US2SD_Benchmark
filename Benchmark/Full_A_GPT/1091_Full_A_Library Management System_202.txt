Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a manager, I want to check librarians and members," involves several entities such as the Manager, the Library Management System (LMS), the Database, and possibly other intermediate services like authentication. The sequence will illustrate the step-by-step interaction between these entities from the moment the manager initiates the check until the information is displayed.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Library Management System" as LMS
database "Database" as DB

== Authentication ==
Manager -> LMS : Request to authenticate
LMS -> DB : Validate manager credentials
DB -> LMS : Credentials validation response
LMS -> Manager : Authentication response

== Check Librarians and Members ==
alt Success Authentication
    Manager -> LMS : Initiate check on librarians and members
    activate LMS
    LMS -> DB : Request librarians and members list
    activate DB
    DB -> LMS : Return librarians and members list
    deactivate DB
    LMS -> Manager : Display librarians and members list
    deactivate LMS
else Failed Authentication
    LMS -> Manager : Display authentication failure message
end

```

### Explanation:
- **Authentication:** The process begins with the manager requesting access to check librarians and members. The LMS prompts for authentication, where the manager's credentials are validated against the database.
- **Decision Making:** Upon successful authentication, the manager is granted access to initiate a check on librarians and members. If authentication fails, an error message is displayed.
- **Data Retrieval:** The LMS requests a list of librarians and members from the database, which then provides the requested information.
- **Result Display:** Finally, the LMS presents the list of librarians and members to the manager.

This sequence diagram brings out the primary interactions for the user story in question, showcasing a simple flow of operations from authentication to data presentation. It's worth noting that, depending on the specific requirements and security protocols of the actual Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) project, additional steps or systems (such as logging or more granular access control checks) might be integrated into this flow.

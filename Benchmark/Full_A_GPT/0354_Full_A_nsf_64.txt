Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story "As a potential research participant, I want to learn about the research and leave my contact information" focusing on the stages that involve the potential participant learning about research opportunities and leaving their contact information on the NSF Beta site requires considering interactions between the user, the user interface, backend systems, and possibly third-party services for managing contact information or notifications. Here's how that sequence could look in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Potential Research Participant" as participant
participant "Beta Site UI" as ui
participant "Content Management System (CMS)" as cms
database "Participant Database" as db
participant "Email Notification Service" as emailService

participant -> ui : Visit NSF Beta Site
ui -> cms : Request research opportunities content
cms -> ui : Display research opportunities
participant -> ui : Select specific research
ui -> cms : Request detailed research information
cms -> ui : Display detailed research information
participant -> ui : Choose to leave contact information
ui -> participant : Display contact information form

participant -> ui : Submit contact information
ui -> db : Save contact information
db -> ui : Confirm information saved
ui -> emailService : Send confirmation email
email(begin,success) -> participant : Receive confirmation email

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines a process where:

1. The participant visits the NSF Beta Site.
2. They request and review the list of research opportunities from the CMS through the UI.
3. The participant selects specific research to learn more about it; the CMS provides detailed information.
4. The option to leave contact information is selected, prompting the UI to display a form.
5. The participant submits their contact information via the UI.
6. The submitted information is saved in a participant database.
7. A confirmation email is sent to the participant, using an email notification service.

This diagram covers the steps from the participant's perspective, from initial site visitation to receiving a confirmation email after submitting contact info, incorporating interactions with the site's UI, CMS, participant database, and an email service.

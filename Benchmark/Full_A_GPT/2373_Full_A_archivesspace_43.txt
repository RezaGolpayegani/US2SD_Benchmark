To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the User Story described, using PlantUML syntax, follow this structure:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Import Module" as importModule
participant "Validation Service" as validation
participant "Database" as db

== Import EAD Data ==

archivist -> web : Select EAD file for import
web -> importModule : Initiate EAD import process
importModule -> validation : Validate EAD file format
alt EAD file is valid
    validation --> importModule : Validation Success
    importModule -> db : Store EAD data
    db --> importModule : Confirm data stored
    importModule -> web : Show import success message
    web --> archivist : Display success message
else EAD file is invalid
    validation --> importModule : Validation Failure with Errors
    importModule -> web : Show import failure and errors
    web --> archivist : Display errors
end

```

Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Archivist initiates the EAD file import**: The sequence starts with the Archivist selecting and initiating the import of an EAD file through the Web Interface.

2. **File validation**: The Import Module calls the Validation Service to validate the file format of the EAD. This step is crucial to ensure that the EAD data can be correctly parsed and stored.

3. **EAD data storage**: If the EAD file is valid, the Validation Service confirms success to the Import Module, which, in turn, proceeds to store the data in the Database.

4. **Confirmation and feedback**: Once the data storage is confirmed by the Database, the Import Module communicates the success to the Web Interface, which then displays a success message to the Archivist.

5. **Handling invalid files**: If the EAD file does not pass validation, the Validation Service sends back an error message to the Import Module, which is then relayed to the Web Interface and shown to the Archivist detailing the reasons for failure.

This sequence diagram is simplistic but captures the key interactions for implementing the EAD data import feature within the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS). Adjustments and enhancements can be made depending on specific implementation details, system architecture, and additional requirements.

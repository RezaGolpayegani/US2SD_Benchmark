To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to look up books by their place and reservations so that I can see if they are available", we will illustrate the interaction between different system components from the initiation of a book lookup by the member until the display of the reservation and availability status. 

Please note, creating a detailed sequence diagram in text format has limitations. Below is a textual representation of how the diagram would be drafted using PlantUML syntax. To visualize the diagram, the PlantUML code needs to be rendered in a PlantUML tool or a compatible environment.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant Member
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation
database "CLMS Database" as Database

Member -> Search : Enter search criteria\n(title, author, category)
activate Search
Search -> Database : Query book information\nand availability status
activate Database
Database --> Search : Return book results\nand availability status
deactivate Database

Search --> Member : Display book results\nand availability status
deactivate Search
Member -> Reservation : Requests to reserve a book
activate Reservation
Reservation -> Database : Check availability\nand reservation status
activate Database
Database --> Reservation : Provide current\nreservation status
deactivate Database

alt If book is available
    Reservation --> Member : Confirm reservation\nProvide pickup details
else If book is reserved/waitlisted
    Reservation --> Member : Inform\nWaitlist position
else

end

This sequence diagram starts with a member searching for a book using criteria like title, author, or category. The search interface queries the CLS Database to find matching books and their availability status. The results are displayed to the member. If the member decides to reserve an available book, the request is processed by the reservation system which again checks the database for the most current availability and reservation status before either confirming the reservation, providing waitlist position, or informing the member if the book is unavailable.

To render this diagram, copy the PlantUML code into a PlantUML editor or tool that supports PlantUML diagrams. This will give you a visual sequence diagram illustrating the process as described in the user story.

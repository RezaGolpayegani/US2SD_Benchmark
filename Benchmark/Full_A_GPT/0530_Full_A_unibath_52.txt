Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves representing the interactions between the funding body, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, researchers, and potentially other systems involved in ensuring robust archival plans. Below is a PlantUML representation of such a sequence diagram.

Please note, PlantUML code needs to be run in a PlantUML processor or compatible tool to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FundingBody as FB
participant "Enhanced Research\nData Management Platform" as ERDMP
participant Researcher as R
participant "Archival Plan\nVerification System" as APVS
participant Database as DB

== Funding Request ==
FB -> R : Request for proposal\nincluding data management plan
R -> ERDNP : Access archival plan\ntemplate

== Creation of Archival Plan ==
R -> ERDNP : Create and submit archival plan
activate ERDNP
ERDNP -> APVS : Validate archival plan
activate APVS
APVS -> DB : Check compliance criteria
activate DB
DB -> APVS : Compliance result
deactivate DB
APVS -> ERDNP : Validation result
deactivate APVS

== Archival Plan Submission ==
ERDNP -> R : Notify about\nvalidation outcome
R -> FB : Submit proposal with\nvalidated archival plan

== Funding Decision ==
FB -> R : Analyze proposal and\narchival plan
FB -> DB : Log funding decision
activate DB
DB -> FB : Acknowledge logging
deactivate DB
FB -> R : Inform about funding decision

== Archival Plan Execution Monitoring == 
FB -> ERDNP : Request progress on archival plan
ERDNP -> DB : Retrieve archival plan progress
activate DB
DB -> ERDNP : Archival plan progress data
deactivate DB
ERDNP -> FB : Provide archival plan progress report

== Funding Effectiveness Analysis ==
FB -> ERDNP : Request metadata for funded projects
ERDNP -> DB : Retrieve metadata
activate DB
DB -> ERDNP : Provide metadata
deactivate DB
ERDNP -> FB : Metadata for analysis

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of interactions starting from the funding body's request for a proposal that includes a data management plan, through the validation of the archival plan by the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform and its Archival Plan Verification System, to the decision on funding and subsequent monitoring of the archival plan's implementation. It also includes the process for the funding body to analyze the effectiveness of funded research projects based on metadata.

Key points in this flow include the creation and submission of the archival plan by the researcher, validation of the plan, the funding body's funding decision, and ongoing monitoring and analysis of the funded project's data management effectiveness.

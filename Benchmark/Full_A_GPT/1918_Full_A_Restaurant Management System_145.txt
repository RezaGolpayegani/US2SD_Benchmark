Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a manager, I want to generate daily occupancy reports, so that I can promote offers for low occupancy days of the week," involves depicting the interactions between the Manager and the Restaurant Management and Operations System components such as the User Interface (UI), Backend Server, Database, and potentially, a Promotions Module, to successfully generate and analyze the occupancy report, leading to the creation of offers. Here's how you can represent this process in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "UI\n(Management Dashboard)" as UI
participant "Backend\nServer" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Promotions\nModule" as Promo

== Generate Daily Occupancy Reports ==
M -> UI: Access Dashboard
UI -> Backend: Request to generate occupancy report
Backend -> DB: Query occupancy data
DB --> Backend: Return occupancy data
Backend -> UI: Display occupancy report
UI --> M: Show report

== Analyze Reports and Identify Low Occupancy Days ==
M -> UI: Review occupancy trends
UI --> M: Low occupancy days highlighted

== Create Offers for Low Occupancy Days ==
M -> UI: Select 'Create Promotion'
UI -> M: Show promotion creation form
M -> UI: Input promotion details\n(for low occupancy days)
UI -> Backend: Send promotion details
Backend -> DB: Store promotion
DB --> Backend: Confirm promotion stored
Backend -> Promo: Schedule promotions
Promo --> Backend: Confirmed promotions scheduling
Backend -> UI: Confirm promotion creation
UI --> M: Show promotion creation success message

### Explanation:
1. **Manager Accesses Dashboard**: The Manager initiates the interaction by accessing the management dashboard through the UI.
2. **Request to Generate Occupancy Report**: The UI sends a request to the Backend to generate a daily occupancy report.
3. **Database Query**: The Backend queries the Database for the required occupancy data.
4. **Report Display**: The returned occupancy data is then processed by the Backend and sent back to the UI to be displayed to the Manager.
5. **Review and Analysis**: The Manager reviews the occupancy trends directly through the UI, where low occupancy days are highlighted.
6. **Promotion Creation**: If the Manager decides to create promotions for low occupancy days, they select the option to create a new promotion and fill in the details.
7. **Promotion Details Processing**: The UI sends these details to the Backend, which stores the promotion in the Database and schedules it through the Promotions Module.
8. **Confirmation**: The Backend confirms the storage and scheduling of the promotions, and the UI displays a success message to the Manager.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow from the perspective of a manager wanting to utilize occupancy reports to manage and promote restaurant offers, using the hypothetical Restaurant Management and Operations System.

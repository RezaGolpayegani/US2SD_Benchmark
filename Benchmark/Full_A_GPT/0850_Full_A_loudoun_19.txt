Given the nature of your request, I'll create a basic outline for a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax. This example will illustrate the sequence of events that could happen when a staff member decides to schedule a meeting to bring the required parties together to address an issue through the County Services & Property Information Portal.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you would need to use a compatible tool or online service that supports PlantUML diagrams.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant StaffMember as staff
participant "Meeting Scheduler" as scheduler
participant "Database" as db
participant "Notification System" as notif
participant Participant as participant

== Schedule Meeting ==
staff->scheduler: Access Meeting Scheduler
activate scheduler

scheduler->staff: Show Meeting Form
staff->scheduler: Submit Meeting Details
activate db

scheduler->db: Save Meeting Information
db->scheduler: Confirm Meeting Saved

scheduler->notif: Prepare Meeting Invitations
activate notif

notif->participant: Send Meeting Invitation
participant->notif: Confirm Receipt

notif->scheduler: Confirm Invitations Sent
scheduler->staff: Meeting Scheduled Successfully

deactivate scheduler
deactivate db
deactivate notif

@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. The **Staff Member** initiates the process by accessing the Meeting Scheduler component of the portal.
2. The Meeting Scheduler then shows the Staff Member a form to fill out with the meeting details.
3. Once the Staff Member submits the meeting details, the Meeting Scheduler attempts to save this information in the Database.
4. The Database confirms that the meeting information has been saved successfully.
5. With the meeting information saved, the Meeting Scheduler now integrates with the Notification System to prepare and send out meeting invitations to all required participants.
6. Each participant receives a meeting invitation and confirms receipt.
7. The Notification System sends back a confirmation of the invitations sent successfully to the Meeting Scheduler.
8. The Meeting Scheduler finally notifies the Staff Member that the meeting has been scheduled successfully.

This diagram assumes a simplified process flow and does not capture potential alternative paths or error handling for brevity. Depending on the specific needs of your project, you might need to customize the sequence to include additional steps, such as error handling, reminder notifications, or integration with third-party calendar services.

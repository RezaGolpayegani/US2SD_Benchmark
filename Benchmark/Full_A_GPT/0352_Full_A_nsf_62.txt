Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story involves several steps, including preparation of the recruiting email templates, approval processes, and the eventual use of those templates for recruiting interviewees quickly. Below is a simplified example of how this process could be diagrammed in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor TeamMember as TM
entity "Recruitment Coordinator\n(RC)" as RC
database "Template Database" as DB
entity "Approval Authority" as AA

== Preparation ==
TM -> RC : Request for email templates
RC -> DB : Check existing templates
alt Templates not available
    DB -> RC : Inform non-availability
    RC -> TM : Request template specifics
    TM -> RC : Provides specifics
    RC -> RC : Create template draft
    RC -> AA : Submit draft for approval
    AA -> AA : Review template draft
    loop Revision Needed
        AA -> RC : Request revisions
        RC -> RC : Revise template
        RC -> AA : Resubmit for approval
    end
    AA -> RC : Approve template
    RC -> DB : Store new template in database
    RC -> TM : Inform about availability
else Templates available
    DB -> RC : Provide existing templates
    RC -> TM : Share templates
end

== Recruitment ==
TM -> TM : Select appropriate template
TM -> TM : Customize template for current need
TM -> TM : Initiate recruitment using template

This sequence diagram starts with a team member (TM) requesting recruiting email templates from the recruitment coordinator (RC). The RC checks the template database (DB) for existing templates:

1. **If templates are not available**, the RC informs the TM about the non-availability, and then the TM provides specifics for what the template should include. The RC creates a draft and submits it to an Approval Authority (AA) for review. The AA might request revisions, and this loop continues until the template is approved. Once approved, the RC stores the new template in the database and informs the TM.

2. **If templates are available**, the RC simply shares these with the TM.

Finally, the TM will select, customize, and use an appropriate template for recruiting interviewees as soon as possible.

This basic sequence diagram can be expanded or modified based on the detailed processes followed by the team for preparing and approving recruiting email templates.

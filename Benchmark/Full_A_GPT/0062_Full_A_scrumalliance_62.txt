Generating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story involves outlining the interactions between the user (site visitor) and the system components involved in performing a full-text search of article body, title, and author name. Below is a basic representation:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Visitor as V
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "SearchController" as SC
database "ArticlesDatabase" as ADB

V -> UI: Enters search keywords
UI -> SC: Invokes search(query)
SC -> ADB: queryDatabase(searchTerm)
ADB -> SC: Returns search results
SC -> UI: Display search results
UI -> V: Shows articles matching criteria
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram steps:

1. **Visitor Enters search keywords**: This is the starting point where the site visitor (actor) enters their search criteria (keywords) into the search bar or user interface designed for inputting search queries.

2. **UI Interface Invokes search(query)**: The User Interface (UI) takes the input from the user and calls the appropriate method/function in the backend (SearchController) to handle the search operation. The user's query is passed as a parameter.

3. **SearchController queryDatabase(searchTerm)**: The SearchController, which handles the logic for searching, now requests the ArticlesDatabase to perform the actual search operation. The database will perform a full-text search against the article body, title, and author name using the provided searchTerm.

4. **ArticlesDatabase Returns search results**: Once the ArticlesDatabase has completed the search operation, it returns the list of articles (or references to them) that match the search criteria back to the SearchController.

5. **SearchController Display search results**: The SearchController processes the received results as needed (e.g., formatting for display, adding metadata) and sends this data back to the User Interface.

6. **UI Interface Shows articles matching criteria**: Finally, the UI Interface displays the search results to the site visitor, showing articles that match the inputted search terms in the body, title, and author name.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the process. Depending on the complexity of the system, additional steps such as error handling, access control, and performance optimizations might also be included in a more detailed design.

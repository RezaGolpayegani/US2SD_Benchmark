Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to display the ingredients list of items, so that I can inform customers" involves illustrating the interactions among various components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This includes the waiter's interface, backend server, and the database where menu items and their ingredients are stored.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents the sequence diagram for this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as WI
participant "Backend Server" as BS
database "Database" as DB

== Display Ingredients List of a Menu Item ==

Waiter -> WI: Selects menu item
WI -> BS: Request ingredients list (itemID)
BS -> DB: Query ingredients (itemID)
DB -> BS: Return ingredients list
BS -> WI: Display ingredients list
WI -> Waiter: Shows ingredients list

@enduml
```

To visualize this diagram, you would need to use PlantUML, a tool that converts text into UML diagrams. This specific diagram follows a simple sequence where:

1. The **Waiter** interacts with the **Waiter Interface**, selecting a menu item for which they need to display the ingredients list.
2. The **Waiter Interface** then sends a request to the **Backend Server** with the identification of the menu item (itemID).
3. The **Backend Server** forwards this request to the **Database**, querying for the ingredients associated with the given itemID.
4. The **Database** processes this query and returns the list of ingredients for the specified menu item back to the **Backend Server**.
5. The **Backend Server** then sends this information to the **Waiter Interface**.
6. Finally, the **Waiter Interface** displays this ingredients list to the **Waiter**, who can then inform the customers.

This diagram encapsulates a simplified flow of operations for a waiter wanting to display a menu item's ingredients list within the proposed Restaurant Management and Operations System, focusing on interactions that facilitate this task.

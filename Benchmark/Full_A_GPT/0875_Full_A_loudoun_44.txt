To create a detailed sequence diagram for managing bonds from the perspective of a staff member in PlantUML format, we'll incorporate several steps and actors that typically participate in the management of bonds for a project. The sequence will include initialization by the staff member, interactions with the system for bond data retrieval, updates, and the eventual release of bonds. Please note, adding more specific functionalities, databases, or systems will depend on the detailed requirements of your project which might not be fully covered in the initial project description. The diagram presented here aims to give a general perspective based on the provided context.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Staff Member" as Staff
participant ":Portal System" as Portal
database "Property \nInformation Database" as Database

== Bond Management Lifecycle ==

Staff -> Portal : Request bond information
activate Portal

Portal -> Database : Query bond details
activate Database
Database --> Portal : Return bond details
deactivate Database

Portal --> Staff : Show bond information
deactivate Portal

Staff -> Portal : Update bond status
activate Portal

Portal -> Database : Save bond updates
activate Database
Database --> Portal : Confirm update success
deactivate Database

Portal --> Staff : Display update confirmation
deactivate Portal

== Bond Release Process ==

Staff -> Portal : Initiate bond release
activate Portal

Portal -> Database : Update bond status to "Release"
activate Database
Database --> Portal : Confirm release success
deactivate Database

Portal --> Staff : Show bond release confirmation
deactivate Portal

In this simplified sequence diagram, the process starts with the "Staff Member" initiating a request to manage bonds within the County Services & Property Information Portal system. The system then interacts with a "Property Information Database" to fetch and display bond information. The "Staff Member" can update the bond status, which the system saves back to the database. Finally, there is a sequence for the bond release process, illustrating how the "Staff Member" initiates a bond release, the system updates the bond status to "Released," and confirms the successful update.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation. Details can be adjusted or expanded based on specific system capabilities, steps in the bond management process, or additional functional requirements not covered in the original project description.

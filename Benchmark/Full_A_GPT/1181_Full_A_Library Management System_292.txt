To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to see the most borrowed books" using PlantUML, follow the steps below. This diagram reflects the interaction between the user (in this case, a library member), the system's UI, backend services, and the database to fetch the data about the most borrowed books.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

M -> UI : Requests to view most borrowed books
UI -> Backend : Fetch most borrowed books
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Query most borrowed books list
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return results
deactivate DB
Backend --> UI : Most borrowed books data
deactivate Backend
UI --> M : Display most borrowed books
@enduml
```

Here's a breakdown of the process depicted in the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Member (M) requests to view the most borrowed books**: This is the initial action where the library member expresses the desire to see which books have been borrowed the most.

2. **UI Interface forwards the request**: The UI Interface acts as the mediator, taking the member's request and forwarding it to the backend service for processing.

3. **Backend Service fetches data**: Upon receiving the request, the backend service initiates a query to the system's database to retrieve information on the most borrowed books. This step involves executing a specific operation to sort and filter books based on their borrowing frequency.

4. **Database returns results**: The database processes the backend's query and returns a list of the most borrowed books. This data includes relevant details necessary for the backend to compile a comprehensive response.

5. **Backend Service sends the data to the UI Interface**: With the data from the database, the backend service formats the response appropriately and sends this information back to the UI Interface.

6. **UI Interface displays most borrowed books to the Member**: Finally, the UI Interface presents the information about the most borrowed top books, completing the member's request.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation that can be embellished with more details, such as error handling and specific data attributes, depending on the complexity of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) and its requirements.

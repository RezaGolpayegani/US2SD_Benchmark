Creating a detailed sequence diagram for your user story, "As a team member, I want to have a platform that allows me to rapidly prototype HTML ideas," involves illustrating the step-by-step interactions between the user (team member), the system components such as the prototyping platform, and potentially other systems like a CMS or version control repository like GitHub. Below is a PlantUML code that outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant TeamMember as TM
participant "Prototyping Platform" as PP
participant "CMS" as CMS
participant "Version Control\n(GitHub)" as VC

== Idea Development ==
TM -> PP: Log in to platform
activate PP
PP --> TM: Authentication success

TM -> PP: Navigate to "Create Prototype"
PP --> TM: Display prototype editor

TM -> PP: Input HTML prototype idea
PP --> TM: Request prototype preview
PP --> TM: Show HTML prototype preview

== Prototype Review & Save ==
TM -> PP: Save prototype
activate PP
TM -> PP: Provide prototype details and metadata
PP --> TM: Prototype saved successfully

== Prototype Sharing ==
TM -> PP: Select "Share Prototype"
PP --> TM: Retrieve shareable link
PP --> TM: Display shareable link

TM -> CMS: Embed Prototype in Content
activate CMS
CMS --> TM: Prototype embedded successfully

TM -> VC: Push prototype code to repository
activate VC
VC --> TM: Prototype code pushed successfully

== Feedback ==
TM -> PP: Request feedback via shareable link
PP --> TM: Feedback collection activated

TM -> PP: Review feedback
PP --> TM: Display received feedback

deactivate PP
deactivate CMS
deactivate VC

This PlantUML sequence diagram depicts the process flow from the perspective of a team member wanting to rapidly prototype HTML ideas. It covers the stages of logging into the prototyping platform, developing an idea, reviewing and saving the prototype, sharing with team members or incorporating it into a CMS, pushing the prototype's code to a version control system like GitHub, and finally gathering feedback on the prototype. 

To view the diagram, ensure you have PlantUML set up with a compatible viewer or integrator, such as a supported IDE or an online PlantUML editor.

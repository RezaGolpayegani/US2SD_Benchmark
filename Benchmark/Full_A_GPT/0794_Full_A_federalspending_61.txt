Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As an Agency user, I want FPDS data to be up-to-date daily," involves depicting the interactions between the Agency user and various system components required to ensure FPDS (Federal Procurement Data System) data is updated daily on the Broker platform. Since the text format has its limits for visual representations, below is a narrative-form description of what the sequence diagram would depict using PlantUML syntax:

```plaintext
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "Agency User" as user
participant "Broker Platform" as broker
participant "FPDS Data Source" as fpds
participant "Data Sync Scheduler" as scheduler
participant "Data Processing Module" as processing
participant "Validation Module" as validation
participant "Notification Service" as notifier

== Daily FPDS Data Update Request ==

user -> broker: Request latest FPDS data
activate broker

broker -> scheduler: Check FPDS data update schedule
activate scheduler

scheduler -> fpds: Fetch latest data
activate fpds

fpds --> scheduler: Return latest FPDS data
deactivate fpds

scheduler -> processing: Send new FPDS data
activate processing

processing -> validation: Validate FPDS data
activate validation

validation -> processing: Return validation results
deactivate validation

processing --> broker: Updated and validated FPDS data
deactivate processing

broker -> notifier: Trigger data update notification
activate notifier

notifier -> user: Send update completion notification
deactivate notifier

deactivate broker

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Elements:
- **Agency User**: Initiates the process by requesting the latest FPDS data.
- **Broker Platform**: The central platform where the process is managed.
- **FPDS Data Source**: The source of procurement data that needs to be updated daily.
- **Data Sync Scheduler**: Manages the schedule of when FPDS data fetches occur.
- **Data Processing Module**: Handles the ingestion and initial processing of FPDS data.
- **Validation Module**: Validates the new FPDS data against pre-defined rules.
- **Notification Service**: Notifies the Agency user when FPDS data has been updated successfully.

### Sequence of Interactions:
1. **Agency User Request**: The process begins with the Agency user requesting the latest FPDS data.
2. **Schedule Check**: The Broker Platform checks if it's time to update FPDS data according to its schedule.
3. **Fetching Data**: If scheduled, it fetches the latest data from the FPDS Data Source.
4. **Data Processing**: The fetched data is sent to the Data Processing Module.
5. **Validation**: The processed data is validated.
6. **Notification**: Upon successful update and validation, the Agency user is notified.

This sequence ensures that the FPDS data on the Broker platform is kept up-to-date daily, aligning with the user's need for current data. Note, the actual implementation details may vary based on the specific technology stack and architecture of the Broker platform.

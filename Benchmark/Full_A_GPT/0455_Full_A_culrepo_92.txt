Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story involves outlining the interactions between the faculty member, the digital repository system, potentially other systems involved in the process, and the actions that lead to the recommendation of a digital collection. Below is a simple sequence diagram representation in PlantUML format.

This diagram assumes that the process involves the faculty member initiating a collection recommendation, the digital repository system processing this recommendation, and potentially interacting with other systems or databases for verification or additional data before accepting the recommendation.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FacultyMember as FM
participant "Digital Repository System" as DRS
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB

This sequence diagram starts when a faculty member initiates a recommendation for a new digital collection. The digital repository system verifies the faculty member's credentials, checks for existing similar collections, and processes the recommendation request. It might ask for additional details about the collection, which the faculty member provides. Finally, the proposal is saved in a database, and the faculty member receives a confirmation of the submission.

Note: This diagram is simplified and does not include all possible error handling or alternative paths for brevity and clarity. Depending on the specific requirements and system architecture of Cornell University's digital repository system, additional steps or interactions (such as departmental approval processes, integration with external systems, or notifications to other stakeholders) might be necessary.

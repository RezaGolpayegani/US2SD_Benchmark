To generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story, you would outline the interactions between the Developer and the various systems/components involved in loading historical FPDS data since 2007. I'll craft a simplified example of what this might look like. Please note, for brevity and focus, some details and steps might be abstracted.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Developer
participant "FPDS API" as FPDS
participant "Data Processing\nModule" as DataProc
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Logging System" as Log

Developer -> FPDS : Request historical data\n(since 2007)
note right: Developer initiates\na data pull request\nfor historical records
FPDS --> Developer : Return historical data
note left: FPDS returns\nthe requested data

Developer -> DataProc : Send historical data for processing
note right: Data requires\nvalidation and formatting

DataProc -> DataProc : Validate data integrity
DataProc -> DataProc : Format according to\nBroker platform schema
DataProc --> Developer : Return processed data
note left: Data is now ready\nto be loaded into Broker

Developer -> DB : Load processed data
note right: Developer initiates\nthe loading procedure

DB -> Log : Log loading activity
note over Log : Capture details of\nthe data load for audit\nand debugging purposes
DB --> Developer : Confirm successful loading
note left: Developer receives\nconfirmation of data\nbeing successfully loaded

This sequence diagram starts with the Developer requesting historical data from the FPDS API, going through data processing for validation and formatting, and finally loading the validated and formatted data into the platform's Database. Additionally, logging activities are captured for auditing and debugging purposes.

To render this PlantUML code, you will need to use a PlantUML environment or integration, such as an online renderer, plugin for a documentation platform or IDE, or a standalone tool supporting PlantUML. This visualization aids in understanding the sequence of actions and interactions required for a Developer to load historical FPDS data within the context of the Comprehensive Broker Platform Enhancement Project.

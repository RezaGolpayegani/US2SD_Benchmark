To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story, I'll outline the primary steps involved in the process when a library visitor wants to check the condition of a book before borrowing it. Please note, PlantUML syntax is designed to be as intuitive as possible, but it still requires a bit of understanding of its conventions to interpret correctly. 

In this scenario, the library visitor interacts with the library management system (likely through a user interface) to check the condition of a book. The system then queries the database for the book's condition and returns this information to the user.

Below, you'll find a PlantUML representation of this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Visitor
participant "Library System Interface" as Interface
participant "Book Management Module" as BookModule
database "Library Database" as Database

Visitor -> Interface : Enter/Search Book Title
alt book found
    Interface -> BookModule : Request Book Details(BookID)
    BookModule -> Database : Query Book Condition(BookID)
    Database --> BookModule : Book Condition
    BookModule --> Interface : Display Book Condition
    Interface --> Visitor : Show Book Condition
else book not found
    Interface --> Visitor : Display "Book Not Found"
end
@enduml
```

### Breakdown of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Visitor Interaction**: The library visitor starts by searching for the book they are interested in through the Library System Interface. This could be through a web page or a kiosk within the library.

2. **System Processing**:
   - The system's interface sends a request to the Book Management Module to retrieve the details for the book, identified by its BookID (or any unique identifier).
   - The Book Management Module then queries the Library Database for the condition of the requested book.
   - The database returns the information regarding the book's condition back to the Book Management Module.

3. **Result Display**:
   - The Book Management Module processes the information received from the database and sends the data regarding the book's condition (e.g., "Good", "Fair", "Damaged") to the Library System Interface.
   - Finally, the visitor is shown the book's condition, allowing them to make an informed decision about borrowing it.

4. **Alternative Path**: If the book is not found in the library database, the system will notify the visitor that the book is not available.

This PlantUML sequence diagram effectively outlines the interaction flow between a library visitor and the library management system for checking the condition of a book. It highlights key components like system interfaces, modules, and the database, providing a clear picture of the process from the user's request to receiving the necessary information.

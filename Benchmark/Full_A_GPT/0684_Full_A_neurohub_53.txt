Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story you provided involves outlining the sequence of interactions between the user and the Neurohub system components when a user wants to draw tables using HTML tags in the content of a log book page. This involves multiple steps including accessing the log book feature, entering or editing a log book page, and submitting the HTML code for the table. Below is an example of how this could be represented in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant WebInterface as "Web Interface"
participant LogBookPage as "Log Book Page"
participant Server as "Server"
database DataStore as "Data Store"

User -> WebInterface: Access Log Book Feature
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> LogBookPage: Open/Create Log Page
activate LogBookPage

User -> LogBookPage: Enter/Edit HTML for Table
activate LogBookPage

LogBookPage -> Server: Submit HTML Content
activate Server

Server -> DataStore: Save Log Page with Table
activate DataStore

DataStore --> Server: Confirm Save
deactivate DataStore

Server --> LogBookPage: Confirm Log Page Saved
deactivate Server

LogBookPage --> User: Display Log Page with Table
deactivate LogBookPage

deactivate WebInterface

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the user accessing the log book feature through the web interface. The user then opens or creates a log page where they can enter or edit HTML code for the table. This input is submitted to the server, which then saves the log page with the table HTML in the data store. The data store confirms the save back to the server, which in turn confirms to the log book page that the log page has been successfully saved. Finally, the log book page displays the page with the table to the user, completing the process.

Please note, the actual implementation details can vary based on the specific architecture of the Neurohub platform, and the diagram might need adjustments to fit into the real application flow accurately.

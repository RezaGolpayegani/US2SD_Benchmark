To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story *“As a member, I want to access all the books in the library”*, we will consider a simplified process flow. This process involves a Member querying the system for all available books, which then interacts with the library's book management system to fetch and display the requested information.

Below is a basic template for a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML depicting this user story. This script is readily usable in a PlantUML environment or editor:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Library Web Interface" as WebInterface
participant "Book Management System" as BookSystem
database "Library Database" as LibraryDB

Member -> WebInterface : Request to view all books
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> BookSystem : Fetch all books
activate BookSystem

BookSystem -> LibraryDB : Query all books
activate LibraryDB

LibraryDB --> BookSystem : Return all book data
deactivate LibraryDB

BookSystem --> WebInterface : Show all books data
deactivate BookSystem

WebInterface --> Member : Display books
deactivate WebInterface

@enduml
```

Explanation of Each Step:

1. **Member -> WebInterface:** This step represents the user’s action to view all books available in the library through the library’s web interface.

2. **WebInterface -> BookSystem:** Upon receiving the request from the user, the web interface communicates with the backend book management system to fetch information about all the books.

3. **BookSystem -> LibraryDB:** The book management system then queries the library database to retrieve information on all the books currently available in the library.

4. **LibraryDB --> BookState:** The library database returns the requested data, including details about each book, back to the book management system.

5. **BookSystem --> WebInterface:** The book management system processes the retrieved data and sends it back to the web interface.

6. **WebInterface --> Member:** Finally, the web interface presents the information about all books in a formatted manner to the member who requested it.

This simplified sequence diagram assumes direct interactions without accounting for possible errors or the complexity of filtering/sorting mechanisms that might be part of a more sophisticated system. Additional layers, like authentication and error handling, could further enhance the diagram for real-world applications.

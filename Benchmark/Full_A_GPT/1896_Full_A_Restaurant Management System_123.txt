To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to delete the list of backup food" using PlantUML, we first identify the actors, systems, and processes involved in this scenario. Note that specifics might vary, but we will assume a basic flow where the manager interacts with the interface, the request is processed by the backend, and finally, interactions with the database occur.

Below is an example of how such a sequence diagram could be structured in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as interface
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Database" as db

manager -> interface : Select "Manage Backup Food List"
interface -> backend : Request to view backup food list
backend -> db : Query backup food list
db -> backend : Return backup food list
backend -> interface : Display backup content
manager -> interface : Choose "Delete Backup List"
interface -> backend : Request to delete backup list
activate backend
backend -> db : Delete backup food list command
db --> backend : Confirmation of deletion
deactivate backend
backend -> interface : Confirm deletion to manager
interface -> manager : Display deletion confirmation
@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the sequence of interactions starting from the manager's desire to delete the backup food list through the user interface (UI), the process handled by the server backend, and the final deletion execution in the database. 

Key steps illustrated:
- Manager initiates the process by selecting the appropriate option to manage the backup food list.
- The backend system fetches and displays the current backup food list from the database.
- The manager chooses to delete the backup list, prompting the interface to send a deletion request to the backend.
- The backend processes this request, deletes the backup food list from the database, and confirms the action.
- The manager receives a confirmation that the backup food list has been successfully deleted.

Remember, this is a simplified example. A real-world application might involve additional steps, such as authentication and authorization checks (to ensure the manager is authorized to delete the backup food list), error handling mechanisms, and possibly cloud storage interactions, depending on the system's architecture.

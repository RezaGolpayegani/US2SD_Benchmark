Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format requires a specific understanding of system interactions. Keep in mind, the sequence diagram provided below is a conceptual rendition based on the information from the project description of DIMS. This diagram outlines interactions involving a user wanting to list all the collections and objects within a specific library unit in a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS). 

This scenario assumes the DAMS supports actions like authenticating users, retrieving a list of collections and objects associated with a specific library unit, and presenting this information to the user.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant User
participant "DIMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Collection Management" as CollectionMng
database "DAMS Database" as DAMSDB

== List Collections and Objects in a Library Unit ==

User -> Interface : Request to list collections/objects
Interface -> Auth : Validate User
Auth --> Interface : User Validated

alt If User is Validated Successfully
    Interface -> CollectionMng : Retrieve collections/objects (LibraryUnitId)
    CollectionMng -> DAMSDB : Query collections/objects (LibraryUnitId)
    DAMSDB --> CollectionMng : Return list of collections/objects
    CollectionMng --> Interface : Collections/Objects details
    Interface --> User : Display Collections/Objects
else If User Validation Fails
    Interface --> User : Display Error (Not Authenticated)
end

This sequence diagram walks through the following steps:

1. **User Request:** The user initiates a request to list all collections and objects in a specific library unit through the DIMS interface.

2. **Validation:** The DIMS interface forwards the user's request to an authentication service to validate the user's identity.

3. **Retrieve Information:** 
   - Upon successful validation, the DIMS interface asks the Collection Management component to retrieve the requested collections and objects.
   - The Collection Management then queries the DAMS database for collections and objects associated with the specified library unit.

4. **Response:** 
   - If the user is authenticated successfully, the DAMS database returns the list of collections and objects to the Collection Management component, which then forwards this information to the DIMS interface, and consequently, the information is displayed to the user.
   - If the user cannot be validated, the DIMS interface displays an error message indicating the user is not authenticated.

This diagram is a broad outline based on assumptions and the supplied project description; specific implementations of the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS) might require adjustments to this flow.

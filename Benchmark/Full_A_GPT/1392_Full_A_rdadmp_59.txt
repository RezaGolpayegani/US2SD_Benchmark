Given the complex and detailed nature of the described project, translating a specific user story into a PlantUML sequence diagram involves defining the interactions between the IT staff member and various system components of the DMPTool. Here is a high-level sequence diagram to reflect these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ITStaffMember as IT
participant "DMPTool Interface" as UI
participant "Metadata Management" as Metadata
participant "Data Type Analysis" as Analysis
participant "IT Resource Planning Tool" as Planning

IT -> UI : Access DMPTool
UI -> Metadata : Request Existing Data Types
Metadata --> UI : Return Data Types List
UI -> IT : Display Data Types
IT -> UI : Indicate Needed Technical Resources
UI -> Analysis : Send Data Types for Analysis
Analysis -> Planning : Analyze and Determine Required Resources
Planning --> Analysis : Resource Requirements
Analysis --> UI : Suggested Technical Resources and Know-How
UI --> IT : Display Technical Resource Needs

This diagram outlines the primary steps an IT staff member would take within the DMPTool to identify the types of data that will be produced or collected in order to ensure the necessary technical resources and expertise are available. Here's a brief walk-through of the diagram: 

- The IT staff member accesses the DMPTool interface.
- The IT staff member requests to see the types of data that the current projects will produce or collect, which is handled through the system's metadata management component.
- The displayed list of data types from metadata management enables the IT staff to understand what kinds of technical resources and expertise might be necessary. 
- The IT staff member may then indicate, through the DMPTool, which technical resources they believe will be needed.
- The DMPTool analyses these requirements, aided by its data type analysis component, which interacts with the IT resource planning tool to determine specific technical requirements.
- Suggestions for required technical resources and know-how are displayed back to the IT staff through the DMPTool interface for further action.

This sequence emphasizes the tool's role in facilitating communication and planning between IT staff and the technical requirements of research projects, ensuring that all necessary preparations are made for efficient data management.

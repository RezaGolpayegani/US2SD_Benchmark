Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a reader, I want to see my favorite genres so that I can explore new books easily by looking at their genres" requires us to outline the sequence of interactions between the system and its components. Let's break down this process.

Given User Story steps for interaction:
1. **User Logs In**: The reader logs into the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).
2. **Navigate to Preferences/Genres**: The reader navigates to a page where they can view or update their preferences, including favorite genres.
3. **View Favorite Genres**: The system retrieves and displays the reader's favorite genres.
4. **Select Genre**: The reader selects a genre to explore books related to it.
5. **System Retrieves and Displays Books**: The system fetches and displays a list of books within the selected genre.
6. **Reader Explores Books**: The reader explores the list and may select a book for more details.

Here's how these steps can be translated into a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Reader
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "User Preferences" as Preferences
participant "Books Service" as Books

== User Login ==
Reader -> Interface : Access CLMS
Interface -> Auth : Validate credentials
Auth -> Interface : Display Dashboard

== Navigate to Preferences/Genres ==
Reader -> Interface : Navigate to Preferences
Interface -> Preferences : Retrieve Favorite Genres
Preferences -> Interface : Display Genres

== Select Genre to Explore Books ==
Reader -> Interface : Select a Genre
Interface -> Books : Fetch Books by Genre
Books -> Interface : Return Books List
Interface -> Reader : Display Books

== Exploration Phase ==
Reader -> Interface : Browse/Select Book
Interface -> Books : Fetch Book Details
Books -> Interface : Return Book Details
Interface -> Reader : Show Book Details

This sequence diagram represents the interactions in PlantUML format, starting from the reader logging in, navigating to see their favorite genres, selecting a genre, and then exploring books within that genre. Note that simplifications are made to focus on the primary sequence related to the user story. In a real-world scenario, additional interactions might include error handling, more complex user interactions, and further details about each book the reader explores.

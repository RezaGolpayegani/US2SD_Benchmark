To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a researcher, I want to stream audio and video files in my web browser" with PlantUML, you must break down the user story into a series of interactions between the system components involved in streaming audio and video files. Please note, the actual implementation details may vary based on the specific technologies and architecture in use, but the following is a simplified sequence diagram example that illustrates a common flow.

```
@startuml

actor Researcher as res
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "Access Control" as ac
participant "Media Server" as ms
participant "Database" as db

res -> web: Request media page
web -> auth: Validate session
auth -> web: Session active
web -> ac: Check access for media
ac -> db: Retrieve user access level
db -> ac: Access level data
ac -> web: Access granted
web -> res: Display media options
res -> web: Select video to stream
web -> ac: Check specific video access
ac -> db: Retrieve video access info
db -> ac: Video access info
ac -> web: Access to video granted
web -> ms: Request video stream URL
ms -> db: Lookup video location
db -> ms: Video location
ms -> ms: Prepare video stream
ms -> web: Video stream URL
web -> res: Embed video stream in browser

To use this diagram:

1. Make sure you have PlantUML installed, or use an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the PlantUML editor.
3. Generate the diagram to visualize the sequence of interactions.

This sequence diagram illustrates the basic interactions starting from the researcher requesting to stream a video, through the system checking permissions and serving the video content to be streamed in the researcher's web browser. It includes user authentication, access control verification for the requested media, retrieval of video stream URL from the media server, and finally, streaming the video to the user.

Keep in mind, for a real-world project, you might need to add more details or adjust the sequence based on specific requirements, such as handling errors, differentiating between audio and video files if the process differs, and including any logging or analytics tracking if required.

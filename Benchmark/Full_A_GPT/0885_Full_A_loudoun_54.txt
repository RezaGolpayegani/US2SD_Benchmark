To fulfill your request for a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story provided, here's how you can visualize the process where a staff member is notified upon changes to Geospatial attributes, which is crucial for reviewing applications or permits with the most current data and standards.

The following PlantUML script outlines the interactions: from detecting changes in Geospatial attributes, notifying the system, and ending with the staff member being informed about these changes.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "Geospatial Data System" as GDS
participant "Change Detection Module" as CDM
participant "Notification System" as NS
participant "Staff Member's Interface" as SMI
database "Property Information Database" as PID

GDS -> PID: Update Geospatial Attributes
activate PID
PID --> GDS: Acknowledgement
deactivate PID

GDS -> CDM: Report Update
activate CDM
CDM -> PID : Confirm Changes
activate PID
PID --> CDM : Changes Confirmed
deactivate PID

CDM --> NS : Trigger Notification
deactivate CDM
activate NS
NS -> SMI : Notify Staff of Changes
activate SMI
SMI --> NS : Acknowledge Notification
deactivate SMI
deactivate NS

### Explanation:

1. **Geospatial Data System (GDS):** This is the system where geospatial attributes of properties are updated. The update could be due to a routine survey, property division, or any other reason affecting geospatial data.

2. **Property Information Database (PID):** This database stores all relevant data, including geospatial attributes, related to properties in the county.

3. **Change Detection Module (CDM):** When the Geospatial Data System reports an update, this module verifies changes in the Property Information Database and determines if significant changes impacting permit or application reviews have occurred.

4. **Notification System (NS):** Upon receiving information about significant changes from the Change Detection Module, this system triggers a notification process.

5. **Staff Member's Interface (SM1):** This represents the user interface where county staff members, including those reviewing permits and applications, receive notifications about changes to geospatial attributes.

This sequence diagram is structured to depict the flow of information and interactions from updating geospatial attributes to notifying the staff member. Each component plays a specific role in ensuring that staff are informed of updates in real-time, allowing for a review process that considers the most accurate and current data available.

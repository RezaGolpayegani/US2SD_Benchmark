Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to talk to the librarians" using Plant UML format requires assuming the existence of a messaging or communication feature within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This diagram outlines the interactions between the system components necessary to facilitate a member initiating a conversation with a librarian. 

Given that the use case is relatively abstract without specific details on the communication mechanism (e.g., live chat, message board, direct messages), I will assume a generic message system that allows members to send messages to librarians, who can then view and respond. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant "Member Interface" as MI
participant "Messaging System" as MS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Librarian Interface" as LI
participant Librarian as L

M -> MI : Selects 'Contact Librarian'
MI -> MS : Initiates message composition
MS --> M : Displays message composition interface

M -> MS : Submits message
MS -> DB : Saves message
DB --> MS : Confirm message saved
MS --> MI : Confirmation & Notification sent to Librarian
MI --> M : Display "Message sent successfully"

L -> LI : Checks for new messages
LI -> MS : Requests new messages
MS -> DB : Retrieves new messages
DB --> MS : Returns new messages
MS --> LI : Displays new messages
LI --> L : Show message from Member

L -> MS : Replies to message
MS -> DB : Saves reply
DB --> MS : Confirm reply saved
MS --> LI : Confirmation & Notification sent to Member
LI --> L : Display "Reply sent successfully"

M -> MI : Receives notification
MI -> MS : Requests message & replies
MS -> DB : Retrieves conversation
DB --> MS : Returns conversation details
MS --> MI : Displays conversation with reply
MI --> M : View reply from Librarian

Explanation:

- **Member initiates contact**: The sequence starts with a member deciding to contact a librarian. The member uses the member interface (MI) of the CLMS to initiate the process.
- **Message composition and submission**: Through the MI, the member composes and submits a message. This message is handled by the messaging system (MS), which saves it to the database (DB).
- **Librarian checks for new messages**: On the librarian side, the librarian accesses new messages through the librarian interface (LI), which interacts with the MS to retrieve any new messages from the DB.
- **Reply process**: Upon reviewing the message, the librarian can respond directly through the LI, with the reply being managed similarly through the MS and stored in the DB.
- **Notification and message viewing**: Both the member and the librarian receive notifications of new messages and replies, allowing for a back-and-forth conversation facilitated by the system.

This sequence diagram simplifies the message exchange process between a library member and a librarian within the envisioned Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), assuming basic features of message composition, saving, retrieval, and notification.

To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story in PlantUML format, it's important to outline the interactions between different entities such as the camp worker, the camp management system, camper profiles, and possibly an interface or service for scheduling or grouping campers. 

Hereâ€™s a simplified PlantUML code snippet outlining the sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CampWorker

participant "Camp Management\nSystem" as CMS
database "Camper Profiles" as CP
database "Scheduling Service" as SS

CampWorker -> CMS : Log in
activate CMS

CMS -> CP : Fetch assigned campers
activate CP
CP --> CMS : List of campers
deactivate CP

CMS -> SS : Get schedule/location for each camper
activate SS
SS --> CMS : Schedule and locations
deactivate SS

CMS --> CampWorker : Display campers and their schedule/location
deactivate CMS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Camp Worker logging into the Camp Management System. The system then retrieves a list of assigned campers from the "Camper Profiles" database. For each of these campers, the system consults a "Scheduling Service" to fetch their schedules and locations. The gathered information is then displayed to the Camp Worker, showing which campers they're in charge of and where these activities will take place.

This diagram doesn't delve into the specifics of each interaction, such as the authentication process or how the campers are assigned to workers in the system. In real implementation, additional steps and participants (like an Authentication Service or a Complex Logic Processor for camper assignment) could be necessary depending on the system's architecture and requirements.

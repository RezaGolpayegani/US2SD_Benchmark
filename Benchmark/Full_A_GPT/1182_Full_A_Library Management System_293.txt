Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to see my book reservation" involves depicting the flow of interaction between the system components (like the User Interface, Controller, Database) and the user. Given the complexity and the need for textual representation as requested, a simplified version of such a sequence is provided below in PlantUML format. This diagram assumes that the system has a web front end that communicates with a back-end server, which then interacts with a database to retrieve reservation information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as M
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Reservation Controller" as RC
participant "Database" as DB

M -> W: Accesses reservation page
W -> RC: Request to view reservations
RC -> DB: Query reservation details
DB -> RC: Return reservation details
RC -> W: Display reservation details
W -> M: Shows reservation details
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps for a member wanting to view their book reservation:

1. **Member Accesses Reservation Page**: The member initiates the process by navigating to the reservation page on the library's web interface.
2. **Web Interface Requests Data**: The web interface sends a request to the reservation controller to fetch the member's reservation details.
3. **Reservation Controller Queries Database**: The reservation controller, upon receiving the request, asks the database for the reservation details of the member.
4. **Database Returns Reservation Details**: The database processes the query and sends back the reservation details to the reservation controller.
5. **Reservation Controller Sends Data to Web Interface**: The reservation controller, after receiving the information from the database, passes it on to the web interface.
6. **Web Interface Shows Reservation Details to Member**: Finally, the web interface displays the reservation details to the member.

This diagram simplifies the interaction for clarity and understanding, actual implementations might include additional steps for authentication, error handling, and data processing.

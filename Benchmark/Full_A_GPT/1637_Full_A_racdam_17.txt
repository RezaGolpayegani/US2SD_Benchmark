Since you are looking to create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on the user story "As an archivist, I want to upload groups of files, so that I can save time", below is a simple example of how this could be outlined. This diagram illustrates the process from selecting files to the completion of the upload process in the context of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as ARCH
participant "File Selection Interface" as FILE_UI
participant "Upload Service" as UPLOAD
participant "Database" as DB
participant "FileManager" as FM
participant "MetadataService" as META
participant "UserNotificationService" as NOTIFY
database "Digital Archive" as ARCHIVE

== File Upload Process ==
ARCH -> FILE_UI: Select files
FILE_UI -> UPLOAD: Initiate upload
UPLOAD -> FM: Validate files
alt Files are valid
  FM -> META: Extract metadata
  META -> DB: Store metadata
  DB --> META: Confirm metadata stored
  META -> UPLOAD: Metadata stored confirmation
  UPLOAD -> ARCHIVE: Save files
  ARCHIVE --> UPLOAD: Confirm files saved
  UPLOAD -> NOTIFY: Send success notification
  NOTIFY -> ARCH: Display success message
else Files are invalid
  FM -> UPLOAD: Return error message
  UPLOAD -> NOTIFY: Send failure notification
  NOTIFY -> ARCH: Display error message
end

Let me break down the activities illustrated in this sequence diagram:

1. **Selection**: The archivist selects groups of files for upload through the file selection interface.
2. **Initiation**: The upload process is initiated.
3. **Validation**: Files are checked for validity (format, size, etc.) by the FileManager.
4. **Metadata Extraction**: If files are valid, metadata is extracted and stored.
5. **File Saving**: Valid files are saved to the digital archive.
6. **Notification**: The archivist receives a notification about the success or failure of the upload.

Please, note that this diagram assumes a relatively straightforward upload process with validation, metadata extraction, and file saving as the core steps. Depending on the specifics of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project, additional steps or services (like specific security checks, file conversion, or more detailed interaction with the metadata service) might be necessary. This diagram can be expanded or modified to fit the detailed requirements and infrastructure of the project.

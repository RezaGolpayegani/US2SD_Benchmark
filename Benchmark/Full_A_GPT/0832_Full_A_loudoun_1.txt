To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the specified user story "As a Public User, I want to Search for Information, so that I can obtain publicly available information concerning properties, County services, processes, and other general information", follow the representation below. This sequence diagram focuses on the interactions between the User, User Interface, Search System, Database, and the Results that are finally presented to the user.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant PublicUser as User
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Search System" as SS
database "Property & County Services Database" as DB

User -> UI : Enter search query
activate UI

UI -> SS : Search request(query)
activate SS

SS -> DB : Query database for information
activate DB

DB --> SS : Return search results
deactivate DB

SS --> UI : Display search results
deactivate SS

UI --> User : Show results to user
deactivate UI
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **PublicUser to User Interface**: The sequence begins with the Public User (User) entering their search query into the User Interface (UI). This could be anything from property information, county services, specific processes, or general information.

2. **User Interface to Search System**: The UI then forwards this query to the Search System (SS), which is responsible for interpreting and processing the user's request.

3. **Search System to Database**: The Search System formulates a database query based on the processed user input and sends this request to the "Property & County Services Database" (DB). This database holds all the publicly available information the county offers.

4. **Database to Search System**: The database processes the query and returns the relevant search results back to the Search System.

5. **Search System to User Interface**: The Search System then forwards these results back to the UI, formatting it in a user-friendly manner for display.

6. **User Interface to PublicUser**: Finally, the UI presents these results back to the Public User, completing the information search process.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions within the system that occur when a public user searches for information through the County Services & Property Information Portal.

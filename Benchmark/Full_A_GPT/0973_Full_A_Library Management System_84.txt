Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story—"As a librarian, I want to see due dates of each book"—involves visualizing the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) when a librarian checks the due dates for books. Below is a PlantUML code to illustrate this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Server" as S
participant "Database" as D

L -> W : Request list of books
W -> S : Fetch book list with due dates
S -> D : Query book details and due dates
D -> S : Return book details and due rates
S -> W : Display books with due dates
W -> L : Show book list and due dates

note over L, D : This sequence assumes the\nlibrarian is logged in and authorized
@enduml
```

To run this PlantUML script, you will need a PlantUML environment set up, such as an online editor (e.g., PlantText, PlantUML QEditor) or an integration in a development environment that supports PlantUML.

This diagram starts with the Librarian requesting a list of books. The request goes through the Web Interface, which communicates with the Server. The Server then queries the Database for the details of the books, including their due dates. The Database sends this information back to the Server, which passes it to the Web Interface, and finally, the librarian is presented with the books along with their due dates on the Web Interface.

This visualization helps in understanding the flow of data and interactions required for a librarian to view the due dates of each book in the Comprehensive Library Management System.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a customer, I want to see the menu," involves showcasing the interactions between the customer, the system's frontend, backend, and the database where the menu items are stored. This sequence will begin when the customer requests to see the menu and end when they receive the menu display. Below is a PlantUML code representation of these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Frontend\n(React/Angular)" as FrontEnd
participant "Backend\n(Node.js + Express)" as BackEnd
database "Database\n(MongoDB/PostgreSQL)" as Database

Customer -> FrontEnd : Request to view menu
FrontEnd -> BackEnd : Fetch menu items
activate BackEnd
BackEnd -> Database : Query menu items
activate Database
Database --> BackEnd : Return menu items
deactivate Database
BackEnd --> FrontEnd : Menu items data
deactivate BackEnd
FrontEnd --> Customer : Display menu

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Customer Request**: The sequence starts with the customer making a request to view the menu through the frontend interface. This interaction could be triggered by the customer selecting a "View Menu" option within the application.

2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**: The frontend application, built with either React.js or Angular, then sends a request to the backend system to fetch the menu items. This demonstrates the separation of concerns, where the frontend is responsible for user interactions, and the backend handles the logic and data retrieval.

3. **Backend Processing**: Upon receiving the request from the frontend, the backend, which is powered by Node.js and Express, processes this request. It communicates with the database to retrieve the menu items.

4. **Database Query**: The database, which can be either MongoDB or PostgreSQL, is queried for the menu items. This step involves retrieving the stored data related to all the menu items that are available to be displayed to the customer.

5. **Data Response Back to Backend**: The retrieved menu items are then sent back from the database to the backend application. This data includes details about each menu item, such as names, descriptions, prices, and possibly images.

6. **Backend to Frontend Response**: The backend system sends the menu items data to the frontend application. This data is prepared in a format that the frontend can use to display the menu to the customer.

7. **Displaying Menu to Customer**: Finally, the frontend application processes the menu items data and displays the menu to the customer. This step concludes the sequence, fulfilling the customer's request to see the menu.

By following this sequence, the system adheres to the project goals of efficiency and satisfaction, allowing customers to interact with the restaurant's offerings in an intuitive and seamless manner.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the outlined user story requires breaking down the process of an Database/Information Repository (DB/IR) administrator setting up or deleting accounts for other administrators with various permission levels. 

Given the complexity, let's draft a simplified version that illustrates the essential steps in both account setup and deletion processes within a digital repository system. This example focuses on the sequence of actions and communications between the system components when an administrator is managing other administrators' accounts.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DB/IR Administrator" as Admin
participant "Administration Interface" as AdminInterface
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
participant "User Management System" as UserManager
participant "Database" as DB

== Account Setup ==
Admin -> AdminInterface : Log in to administration portal
AdminInterface -> AuthService : Validate admin credentials
AuthService --> AdminInterface : Credentials valid
AdminInterface --> Admin : Access granted

Admin -> AdminInterface : Navigate to "Create Account"
AdminInterface -> Admin : Display account creation form

Admin -> AdminInterface : Submit new admin account details with permissions
AdminInterface -> UserManager : Create account with specified permissions
UserManager -> DB : Update accounts table
DB --> UserManager : Confirm account creation
UserManager --> AdminInterface : Display account creation confirmation
AdminInterface --> Admin : Show success message

== Account Deletion ==
Admin -> AdminInterface : Navigate to "Manage Accounts"
AdminInterface -> Admin : Display account list

Admin -> AdminInterface : Select account to delete
AdminInterface -> UserManager : Request account deletion
UserManager -> DB : Update accounts table to remove account
DB --> UserManager : Confirm account deletion
UserManager --> AdminInterface : Display account deletion confirmation
AdminInterface --> Admin : Show success message

This diagram reflects a basic interaction flow between the DB/IR administrator and the system components when setting up or deleting administrator accounts. The sequence includes authentication, account creation/deletion tasks, and confirmation steps. Note that in a real implementation, the processes may involve more detailed interactions depending on the system's complexity, security requirements, and specific business rules. Additionally, error handling steps (e.g., invalid credentials or failed account creation/deletion) should be included in a comprehensive design.

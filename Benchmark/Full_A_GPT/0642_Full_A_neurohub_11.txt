To describe the process of uploading files before attaching them to a logbook page, as outlined in the project description, a sequence diagram can be a powerful tool. Below is a PlantUML representation of this user story, detailed at a sequence level. This diagram assumes a web-based interaction from the researcher's perspective, involving a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the Neurohub platform, a file handling service for managing uploads, and a logbook service for managing entries and attachments.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "Web GUI" as gui
participant "File Handling Service" as fhs
participant "Logbook Service" as lbs

res -> gui : Select files for upload
gui -> fhs : Initiate file upload
activate fhs
fhs -> fhs : Validate file types and sizes
fhs -> fhs : Store files temporarily
res <- fhs : Display upload progress and confirmation
deactivate fhs
res -> gui : Navigate to logbook page
gui -> lbs : Request logbook page
activate lbs
lbs -> lbs : Retrieve logbook page details
res <- lbs : Display logbook page
deactivate lbs
res -> gui : Attach uploaded files to logbook page
gui -> lbs : Request file attach operation
activate lbs
lbs -> fhs : Retrieve files from temporary storage
activate fhs
fhs -> lbs : Provide files
deactivate fhs
lbs -> lbs : Attach files to logbook page
res <- lbs : Confirm attachment
deactivate lbs

This sequence diagram starts with the researcher selecting files for upload through the Neurohub's Web GUI. The files are then managed by the File Handling Service, which validates them and stores them temporarily. Once the files are uploaded successfully, the researcher can navigate to the desired logbook page, and with the GUI, attach the uploaded files to this page. The Logbook Service manages the retrieval of files from temporary storage and their attachment to the logbook page, confirming the operation to the researcher upon completion.

This diagram simplifies the interaction to focus on the main steps related to the user story while abstracting away from the specifics of each system component's internal workings. Adjustments may be necessary based on the project's detailed requirements and technical architecture.

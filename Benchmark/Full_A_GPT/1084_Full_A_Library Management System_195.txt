Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to delete library members." using PlantUML syntax involves outlining the objects involved in this interaction and how these objects exchange messages among them. This action typically involves a manager using the library management system's interface to request the deletion of a member, the system validating this request, and checking the memberâ€™s data before proceeding to delete the member from the database.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents the sequence diagram for the mentioned user story. This example assumes a simplified process where the manager interacts with a web interface, which in turn communicates with a backend system to execute the deletion. Notice that the actual implementation might require more steps depending on the system's complexity and features such as logging, error handling, and confirmation messages.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as M
participant WebInterface as W
participant BackendSystem as B
participant Database as DB

M -> W: Request to delete member
activate W
W -> B: Validate request
activate B
B -> B: Check manager permissions
B -> DB: Request member data
activate DB
DB --> B: Member data
deactivate DB
B -> DB: Delete member request
activate DB
DB --> B: Confirmation of deletion
deactivate DB
B --> W: Display deletion success message
deactivate B
W --> M: Display confirmation message
deactivate W

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the Manager (M) requesting to delete a member through the WebInterface (W). The WebInterface then validates this request and forwards it to the BackendSystem (B), which first checks if the manager has the necessary permissions for this action. If the validation passes, the BackendSystem requests the member's data from the Database (DB) and then sends a delete request for that member. Upon successful deletion, the Database confirms back to the BackendSystem, which in turn instructs the WebInterface to display a success message to the Manager.

Please ensure your environment is set up to parse PlantUML code to visualize this diagram. Software like PlantUML Viewer in Visual Studio Code or online PlantUML editors can interpret this syntax and show the corresponding sequence diagram graphically.

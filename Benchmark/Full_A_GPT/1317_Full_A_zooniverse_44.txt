Below is a PlantUML code snippet outlining a sequence diagram for the described user story. This diagram depicts the interaction between a Zooniverse admin and the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) for prefiltering images to remove artifacts such as bright stars and camera read errors.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Zooniverse Admin" as admin
participant "Image Prefiltering System" as prefilter
participant "Artifact Detection Module" as artifactDetection
participant "Image Database" as database

admin -> prefilter : Initiate prefiltering process
prefilter -> artifactDetection : Request artifact detection
artifactDetection -> database : Retrieve images
database --> artifactDetection : Return images
artifactDetection -> artifactDetection : Detect and mark artifacts\n(bright stars, camera read errors)
artifactDetection --> prefilter : Return detection results
prefilter -> database : Request removal of marked artifacts
database --> prefilter : Confirm removal
prefilter --> admin : Prefiltering complete

### Explanation:
1. **Zooniverse Admin Initiates Prefiltering Process:** The sequence begins with the Zooniverse admin initiating the prefiltering process for cleaning up the images.
2. **Request for Artifact Detection:** The Image Prefiltering System requests the Artifact Detection Module to identify and mark any artifacts in the images, such as bright stars and camera read errors.
3. **Image Retrieval:** The Artifact Detection Module retrieves the images to be analyzed from the Image Database.
4. **Detection and Marking of Artifacts:** Using advanced detection algorithms, the Artifact Detection Module identifies artifacts in the images. These artifacts are then marked for removal.
5. **Image Cleaning:** After marking, the Artifact Detection Module informs the Image Prefiltering System of the detection results. The Image Prefiltering System then requests the removal of the marked artifacts from the Image Database.
6. **Prefiltering Completion:** Once the Image Database confirms the successful removal of the marked artifacts, the Image Prefiltering System notifies the Zooniverse admin that the prefiltering process is complete.

This sequence diagram encapsulates the process flow involved in prefiltering images to remove undesirable artifacts, leveraging the capabilities of the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP).

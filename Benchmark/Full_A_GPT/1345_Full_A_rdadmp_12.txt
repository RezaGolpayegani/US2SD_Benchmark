To create a sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML, please follow this guideline. Note that PlantUML syntax can be used with various software or online editors that support it. The diagram described below outlines the interactions between a Principal Investigator (PI), the DMPTool System, and the Ethics Committee as part of the process of recording and reviewing a Data Management Plan (DMP) for compliance with ethical standards.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor PI
participant "DMPTool System" as DMP
participant "Ethics Committee" as EC

== Record Information about DMP ==
PI -> DMP: Login()
activate DMP

PI -> DMP: Select Create/Update DMP()
DMP -> DMP: Display DMP template
activate DMP

PI -> DMP: Enter DMP info(metadata, security measures, etc.)
DMP -> DMP: Validate and save DMP info
DMP --> PI: DMP saved confirmation

== Submit for Review ==
PI -> DMP: Submit DMP for review
DMP -> EC: Send DMP for Ethics Review
activate EC
EC -> EC: Review DMP for compliance
EC -> DMP: Send review outcome
deactivate EC

DMP -> PI: Display review outcome (compliant/non-compliant)
deactivate DMP

### Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Login**: The PI starts the process by logging into the DMPTool System.
2. **Select Create/Update DMP**: The PI selects the option to create or update a DMP.
3. **Enter DMP info**: The PI enters all required information related to the DMP, which includes metadata about the research data, plans for data storage, ethical considerations, and security measures.
4. **Validate and save DMP info**: The DMPTool System validates the entered information for completeness and saves it. A confirmation is then sent back to the PI.
5. **Submit DMP for review**: Once the DMP is complete, the PI submits it for review to the Ethics Committee through the DMPTool System.
6. **Review DMP for compliance**: The Ethics Committee receives the DMP and reviews it for compliance with ethical standards.
7. **Send review outcome**: After review, the Ethics Committee sends the outcome back to the DMPTool System, which could be either compliant or non-compliant.
8. **Display review outcome**: Lastly, the PI is informed about the review outcome through the DMPTool System.

This sequence diagram visualizes the high-level interactions involved in recording and reviewing information about a DMP for ethical compliance within the DMPTool.

Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to see contents of drinks" involves illustrating the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Given your specific request, we'll focus on the sequence that occurs when an employee queries the system to view the contents of drinks.

Below is an example of how such a sequence diagram could be structured in PlantUML syntax. This example assumes the interaction begins with an employee making a request through a user interface and ends with the system displaying the requested information.

```
@startuml
!theme cerulean

actor Employee
participant "UI Application" as UI
participant "Server\n(Node.js/Express)" as Server
database "Database\n(MongoDB/PostgreSQL)" as DB

== View Drink Contents ==
Employee -> UI : Select "View Drink Contents"
UI -> Server : GET /drinks/contents
alt Drinks found
    Server -> DB : Query drink details
    DB -> Server : Return drink details
    Server -> UI : Display drink contents
    UI -> Employee : Show drink details
else No drinks found
    Server -> UI : Display error message
    UI -> Employee : Show "No drinks available"
end
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Employee:** The actor initiating the request. This represents any restaurant employee interested in viewing the drink details.
- **UI Application:** The front-end interface through which the employee interacts. This could be developed using React.js or Angular.
- **Server (Node.js/Express):** The backend server that processes the request. It acts as an intermediary between the UI application and the database.
- **Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL):** Where drink details are stored. The choice between MongoDB or PostgreSQL depends on the project's database implementation.

### Sequence Steps:
1. The **Employee** selects the option to "View Drink Contents" on the UI Application.
2. The **UI Application** sends a request to the **Server** to retrieve drink contents. This is typically done through a REST API call, in this scenario defined as `GET /drinks/contents`.
3. The **Server** queries the **Database** to retrieve the details of the drinks.
    - If the drinks are found, the database returns the drink details to the server.
    - The server then sends this information back to the UI Application, which displays the drink contents to the employee.
    - If no drinks are found, the server instructs the UI to display an appropriate error message, such as "No drinks available."

This simplified sequence diagram provides a basic overview of the interactions involved in fulfilling the employee's request to view the contents of drinks within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the system, additional details and components might be necessary to fully capture the user story's implementation.

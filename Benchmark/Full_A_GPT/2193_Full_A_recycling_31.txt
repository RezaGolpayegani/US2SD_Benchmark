To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a company, I want to have a website that is easy to use, so that I can upload or delete stuff step by step," we will focus on the interaction between various components such as the User Interface (UI), Application Logic, and Database within the RecycleSmart platform. This sequence will illustrate steps a recycling facility representative (company) might follow to upload or delete information regarding recycling center data.

The PlantUML code below represents a sequence diagram that outlines the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacilityRep as "Facility Representative"
participant UI as "User Interface"
participant AL as "Application Logic"
database DB as "RecycleSmart Database"

== Upload Information Process ==
FacilityRep -> UI : Access website
activate UI

UI -> AL : Authenticate login
activate AL

AL -> DB : Validate user credentials
activate DB

DB -> AL : Credentials valid
deactivate DB

AL -> UI : Display Dashboard
deactivate AL

FacilityRep -> UI : Select "Upload Info"
UI -> AL : Request data form
AL -> UI : Display data form

FacilityRep -> UI : Fill in data form
FacilityRep -> UI : Submit information

UI -> AL : Process submission
activate AL

AL -> DB : Insert/Update info
activate DB

DB -> DB : Validate & Store data
DB -> AL : Confirm success
deactivate DB

AL -> UI : Display success message
deactivate AL
UI -> FacilityRep : Show confirmation

== Delete Information Process ==
FacilityRep -> UI : Access Dashboard
UI -> AL : Authenticate session
AL -> UI : Show Dashboard options

FacilityRep -> UI : Select "Delete Info"
UI -> AL : Request item selection

FacilityRep -> UI : Select item(s) to delete
FacilityRep -> UI : Confirm deletion

UI -> AL : Process deletion request
activate AL

AL -> DB : Delete selected info
activate DB

DB -> DB : Validate & Remove data
DB -> AL : Confirm deletion success
deactivate DB

AL -> UI : Display deletion success message
deactivate AL
UI -> FacilityRep : Show confirmation
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step process for a facility representative to upload new information or delete existing information through the RecycleSmart platform. The diagram shows interactions starting from the facility representative accessing the website, authenticating, choosing to either upload new data or delete existing data, and receiving confirmation of the success of their action.

To visualize this diagram, you'll need to use a tool that supports PlantUML code, like an online PlantUML editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) plugin that renders PlantUML diagrams.

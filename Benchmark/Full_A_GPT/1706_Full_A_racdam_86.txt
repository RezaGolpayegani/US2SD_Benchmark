Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an archist, I want to search images by rights" in PlantUML format is a great way to visualize the interaction between components within the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project. Below is a PlantUML code example that illustrates this sequence.

This sequence diagram outlines the steps that occur from the moment the archivist initiates a search by image rights until the system displays the results. Remember, PlantUML syntax is quite straightforward: objects are defined at the start, and interactions are denoted with arrows. Comments are preceded by a single quote (`'`) to add clarity to the diagram code.

```plantuml
@startuml
' Define participants
actor Archivist
participant "SearchInterface" as Search
participant "RightsManagementSystem" as Rights
participant "Database" as DB
database "DigitalArchive" as Archive

' Workflow
Archivist -> Search : enters search criteria for rights
Search -> Rights : request validation of search query
Rights -> DB : retrieve rights information
DB --> Rights : rights information
Rights --> Search : validated search parameters
Search -> Archive : search images by rights
Archive --> Search : search results
Search --> Archivist : display results

' Add notes
note right of Search: Search criteria includes\nspecific rights or licenses
note right of Archive: Filtering is done based on\nthe rights metadata of images

### Explanation:

1. **Start**: An archivist uses a search interface to enter search criteria based on image rights.

2. **Search Interface**: The interface captures search input from the archivist and forwards it for validation.

3. **Rights Management System (Rights)**: This system receives the search query and validates it against the existing rights and licensing guidelines, ensuring that the search request adheres to allowed parameters.

4. **Query Rights Information**: The Rights Management System queries the database for rights information to validate the search parameters.

5. **Database (DB)**: The Digital Archive's database returns the requested rights information to the Rights Management System.

6. **Search Execution**: With validated search parameters, the Search Interface sends a request to the Digital Archive to fetch images that match the specified rights criteria.

7. **Digital Archive (Archive)**: The archive processes the search request, filtering images based on their rights metadata.

8. **Results Display**: The search results are sent back to the Search Interface, which then displays the images that match the search criteria to the archivist.

9. **Notes**: Additional details are provided through notes to clarify the criteria used for search (specific rights or licenses) and the basis of filtering within the Digital Archive (rights metadata).

This sequence diagram provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the process involved when an archivist wants to search images by rights within the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project.

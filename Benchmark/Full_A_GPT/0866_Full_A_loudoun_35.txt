Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story described involves illustrating the interaction between different entities such as the Plan Review Staff member, the County Services & Property Information Portal system, potential databases, and the Plan Reviewer entity. This interaction is showcased within the PlantUML language, presenting a step-by-step process from the moment the Plan Review Staff member decides to assign plans for review until the assignment is acknowledged by the Plan Reviewer. 

Below is the PlantUML code that represents these interactions tailored to your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Plan Review Staff" as staff
participant "Portal Interface" as portal
database "Application Database" as db
participant "Assignment Module" as assignment
actor "Plan Reviewer" as reviewer

== Assign Plans for Review ==
staff -> portal : Select Application to Assign
portal -> db : Query Application Details
db --> portal : Return Application Details
portal --> staff : Display Application Details

staff -> portal : Initiate Assignment Process
portal -> assignment : Invoke Assignment Module
note over assignment : Determine Eligible Reviewers

assignment -> db : Retrieve Reviewers List
db --> assignment : Return Reviewers List
assignment --> portal : Display Reviewers for Selection

staff -> portal : Select Plan Reviewer
portal -> assignment : Assign Reviewer to Application
assignment -> db : Update Application with Reviewer Info
db --> assignment : Confirm Update

assignment --> portal : Confirm Assignment
portal --> staff : Show Assignment Success Message
staff -> portal : Notify Plan Reviewer
portal -> reviewer : Send Assignment Notification
note over reviewer : Reviewer Receives Assignment

This sequence diagram begins with the Plan Review Staff selecting an application to assign and ends with the Plan Reviewer being notified of the assignment. The steps detail interactions between the staff member, portal interface, database, assignment module, and finally, the Plan Reviewer. It is made with the assumption that there's a centralized system (the portal) that facilitates these interactions, a database that stores application and reviewer information, and an assignment module/logic within the system dedicated to managing the assignment of reviewers to specific applications.

Remember, this is a simplified representation focusing on the main steps outlined in your user story. Depending on the system's complexity and specific implementation details, additional steps or entities (like authentication processes, more detailed notification systems, or error handling mechanisms) might be needed for a comprehensive design.

Given the complexity of detailing a complete sequence diagram in a text response, below is a simplified Plant UML format outline for the user story: "As a student, I want to be able to search for a specific genre". This script outlines the interactions between the student (user), the front-end system of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the back-end server/database that processes the search for books within a specific genre.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student
participant "CLMS Frontend" as Frontend
participant "CLMS Backend" as Backend
database "Library Database" as Database

Student -> Frontend : Accesses CLMS and selects "Search by Genre"
Frontend -> Student : Displays genre selection dropdown
Student -> Frontind : Selects specific genre (e.g., "Science Fiction")
Frontend -> Backend : Request to search books by genre "Science Fiction"
Backend -> Database : Query books by genre "Science Fiction"
Database --> Backend : Returns list of books in "Science Fiction" genre
Backend --> Frontend : Sends search results
Frontend --> Student : Displays books in "Science Fiction" genre

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Student to CLMS Frontend**: The process initiates when the student accesses the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) and selects the option to search by genre. The frontend interface provides the student with a dropdown to choose from available genres.

2. **CLMS Frontend to Student**: After the student selects the "Search by Genre" option, the frontend displays a genre selection dropdown, allowing the student to pick the preferred genre.

3. **Student to CLMS Frontend**: The student selects a specific genre, for example, "Science Fiction", from the dropdown menu. 

4. **CLMS Frontend to CLMS Backend**: The frontend sends a request to the backend system for a list of books categorized under the selected genre, "Science Fiction" in this case.

5. **CLMS Backend to Library Database**: The backend system queries the library's database for books that are labeled with the genre "Science Fiction".

6. **Library Database to CLMS Backend**: The database returns a list of books classified under the "Science Fiction" genre to the backend system.

7. **CLMS Backend to CLMS Frontend**: The backend sends the search results, which is a list of "Science Fiction" books, back to the frontend.

8. **CLMS Frontend to Student**: Finally, the frontend displays the list of books in the "Science Fiction" genre to the student, completing the search process.

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified process flow for searching books by a specific genre in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). The interaction encapsulates how the system components work together to fulfill the user's request.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to see which book has been read the most this month" involves representing the sequence of steps and interactions among various system components and stakeholders to fulfill this requirement. Here's a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Customer as C
participant WebInterface as W
participant RecommendationEngine as RE
participant Database as DB

C -> W : Request most read book this month
W -> RE : Query most popular book
RE -> DB : Fetch borrowing stats for current month
DB --> RE : Return stats
RE -> DB : Identify most read book
DB --> RE : Return most read book details
RE --> W : Send most read book details
W --> C : Display most read book

```

### Explanation:

1. **Customer to WebInterface**: The sequence begins with the customer requesting to see which book has been read the most this month. This interaction typically happens through a user interface on a website or mobile app.

2. **WebInterface to RecommendationEngine**: The web interface, upon receiving the customer's request, communicates with the Recommendation Engine to query the most popular (most read) book of the current month.

3. **RecommendationEngine to Database**: The Recommendation Engine will then request the borrowing statistics for the current month from the Database. This involves getting data on all books borrowed within the month and their respective read counts.

4. **Database to RecommendationEngine**: The Database returns the statistics (read counts for each book in the current month) to the Recommendation Engine.

5. **Identify Most Read Book**: With the borrowing stats at hand, the Recommendation Engine identifies the book with the highest read count within the current month.

6. **Return Most Read Book Details**: After identifying the most read book, the Recommendation Engine requests the detailed information of the book (like title, author, summary) from the Database, which then returns this information.

7. **RecommendationEngine to WebInterface**: The Recommendation Engine sends the details of the most read book back to the Web Interface.

8. **WebInterface to Customer**: Finally, the web interface displays the most read book of the month to the customer, completing the query process.

This sequence diagram outlines the interaction flow required to fulfill the user's need to see which book has been read the most in the current month, leveraging a combination of web interface, recommendation engine logic, and database queries.

Given the complexity of the requested task, generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story in PlantUML syntax can be quite involved. Below is a simplified example that highlights the basic process a repository manager might follow to indicate the geo-coordinates for a resource deemed useful to an end user within the context of the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS).

This sequence diagram assumes there's an existing UI and backend system where the repository manager interacts with the digital asset management features. Please note, due to the constraints of this response format, the diagram will focus on the core interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor RepositoryManager as RM "Repository Manager"
participant DIMSUI as UI "DIMS UI"
participant DIMSService as DS "DIMS Backend Service"
participant DAMSDB as DB "DAMS Database"

RM -> UI : Log in to DIMS
UI -> DS : Validate login
DS -> RM : Display Dashboard

RM -> UI : Select resource to update
UI -> DS : Fetch resource details
DS -> DB : Query resource by ID
DB -> DS : Return resource data
DS -> UI : Display resource details
RM -> UI : Indicate/update geo-coordinates
UI -> DS : Update request with geo-coordinates
DS -> DB : Update resource record
DB -> DS : Confirm update
DS -> UI : Display success message
UI -> RM : Confirm geo-coordinates update

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Repository Manager (RM):** This actor represents the person interacting with the DIMS to update geo-coordinates.
- **DIMS UI (UI):** The user interface of the DIMS where the repository manager logs in and performs actions.
- **DIMS Backend Service (DS):** The server-side component that processes requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses.
- **DAMS Database (DB):** The database where digital asset details and metadata, including geo-coordinates, are stored.

1. **Logging In:** The repository manager starts by logging into the DIMS through the UI.
2. **Selecting Resource:** Once logged in and the dashboard is displayed, the repository manager selects the resource for which they want to indicate geo-coordinates.
3. **Fetching Resource Details:** The backend service fetches and displays the details of the selected resource by querying the database.
4. **Updating Geo-Coordinates:** The manager provides the new geo-coordinates through the UI.
5. **Processing Update:** The backend service processes the update request and modifies the relevant database record.
6. **Confirmation:** The UI displays a success message confirming the update of geo-coordinates.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation meant to illustrate the process flow described in the user story. Actual implementations could differ based on specific technological stacks, security requirements, and additional functionalities within DIMS.

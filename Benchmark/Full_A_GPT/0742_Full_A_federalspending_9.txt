Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story that involves a DevOps engineer wanting New Relic to provide useful data across all applications can be quite complex, given the numerous interactions between the user, the system, and New Relic. Here, we'll outline a basic PlantUML format sequence diagram to illustrate this process. Keep in mind, the actual implementation can vary greatly depending on specific system designs and organizational processes.

Note: The following PlantUML code snippet is a basic representation. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust or expand this outline significantly.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DevOpsEngineer as DevOps
participant "Broker Platform" as Broker
participant "New Relic API" as NewRelicAPI
participant "New Relic" as NewRelic
database "Application Logs" as Logs

DevOps -> Broker: Request application monitoring setup
Broker -> NewRelicAPI: Initiate setup for New Relic integration
NewRelicAPI -> NewRelic: Request integration with Broker platform
NewRelic --> NewRelicAPI: Confirm integration setup
NewRelicAPI --> Broker: Return integration confirmation
Broker -> Logs: Enable detailed logging
Logs --> Broker: Confirm logging enabled
Broker --> DevOps: Confirm New Relic integration and logging setup

DevOps -> NewRelic: Access New Relic Dashboard
NewRelic -> NewRelicAPI: Fetch application performance data
NewRelicAPI -> Logs: Request application logs
Logs --> NewRelicAPI: Return requested logs
NewRelicAPI --> NewRelic: Provide application performance and logs data
NewRelic --> DevOps: Display application performance and logs

This diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions starting from the DevOps engineer's request to set up application monitoring with New Relic, through the process involving the Broker platform, New Relic API, New Relic itself, and the logging system.

**Key Points in the Diagram:**

- **Initiation:** The DevOps engineer requests the setup of application monitoring on the Broker platform for New Relic.
- **Integration Process:** The Broker platform interacts with the New Relic API to set up integration, which involves setting up detailed logging and confirming the integration setup back to the DevOps engineer.
- **Data Fetching and Display:** The DevOps engineer then accesses the New Relic Dashboard, which fetches application performance data, including detailed logs from the Broker platform, to provide comprehensive insights.

Remember, this is a simplified version. The actual interactions might include more steps like authentication, error handling, and specific configuration settings depending on your implementation requirements and the capabilities of New Relic and the Broker platform.

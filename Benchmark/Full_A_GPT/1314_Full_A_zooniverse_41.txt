Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between different actors and systems within the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) to automatically detect when a worm lays an egg in a video from the Worm Watch Lab. Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing these interactions. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Zooniverse Admin" as admin
participant "AMIDP System" as system
database "Video Database" as db
participant "Video Analysis Module" as vam
participant "AI/ML Model" as model

admin -> system : Upload/select video for analysis
system -> db : Retrieve video data
db -> system : Return video data
system -> vam : Initiate video analysis
vam -> model : Analyze for egg-laying event
model -> model : Process & recognize patterns
model --> vam : Egg-laying event time(s)
vam --> system : Return analysis results
system -> admin : Display detected time of event

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Zooniverse Admin Initiates Request:** The interaction begins with the Zooniverse admin uploading or selecting a video from the Worm Watch Lab for analysis.

2. **AMIDP System Retrieves Video:** The system then retrieves the video data from the Video Database, where all Worm Watch Lab videos are presumably stored.

3. **Video Analysis Module (VAM) Activation:** Once the video data is available, the system triggers the Video Analysis Module to analyze the video for the specific event of interest - in this case, when a worm lays an egg.

4. **AI/ML Model Processing:** The VAM utilizes an AI/ML model specifically trained to recognize patterns and events within videos, such as the activity of a worm laying an egg. This model processes the video, analyzing frames and patterns to detect the desired event.

5. **Returning the Analysis Results:** After the AI/ML model has successfully detected the time(s) when the worm lays an egg, these results are returned to the VAM, which in turn sends them back to the AMIDP system.

6. **Displaying Results to Admin:** Finally, the system presents the detected times of the event to the Zooniverse admin, completing the process.

This sequence diagram simplifies complex backend interactions but includes all essential steps from the initiation of the request by a Zooniverse admin to the display of results. It showcases the advanced capabilities of AMIDP in leveraging AI/ML technologies for precise content analysis within a user-friendly platform.

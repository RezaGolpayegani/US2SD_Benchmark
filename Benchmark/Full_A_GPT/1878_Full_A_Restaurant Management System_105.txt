Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to change the workers' work time" involves illustrating the interactions between different components of the system to fulfill this specific requirement. Below is a text-based representation of how you could code this sequence diagram using PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "UI: Manager Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> Dashboard : Access employee schedule
Dashboard -> Server : Request current schedule
Server -> DB : Query employee work time
DB -> Server : Return current schedule
Server -> Dashboard : Display current schedule
Manager -> Dashboard : Inputs new work time
Dashboard -> Server : Submit updated work time
Server -> DB : Update work time in database
DB -> Server : Confirm update
Server -> Dashboard : Confirm schedule updated
Dashboard -> Manager : Display update confirmation

This sequence diagram represents the process flow from the manager's intention to change worker's work time through the system components involved to achieve the task. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. The **Manager** accesses the employee schedule through the manager dashboard interface.
2. The **manager dashboard** then sends a request to the **backend server** to fetch the current work schedule of employees.
3. The **backend server** queries the **database** to retrieve the current employee work times.
4. The **database** returns the current schedule details to the backend server.
5. The **backend server** sends the schedule details to the **manager dashboard**, where it is displayed to the manager.
6. The **Manager** enters the new work time details into the dashboard interface.
7. The **manager dashboard** submits these updated work time details to the **backend server**.
8. The **backend server** processes and updates these new work times in the **database**.
9. The **database** confirms the update back to the **backend server**.
10. The **backend, server** then communicates the successful schedule update back to the **manager dashboard**.
11. Finally, the **manager dashboard** displays the update confirmation to the **Manager**.

This sequence diagram facilitates understanding of how the system components interact to achieve a common user story goal and can be adapted or expanded based on additional system features or complexities.

Given your request to create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for a user researcher conducting a user definition workshop with NSF to prepare them and the team for future research work, below is a PlantUML sequence diagram representation that outlines this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserResearcher as Researcher
participant NSF_Team as NSF 
participant Cloud as "Cloud Infrastructure"
participant CMS as "Content Management System"
participant DataStorage

Researcher -> NSF : Schedule Workshop
activate Researcher

NSF -> NSF : Gather Required Participants
Researcher <- NSF : Confirm Participants & Schedule
Researcher -> Researcher : Prepare Workshop Material

Researcher -> NSF : Conduct Workshop

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram steps:

1. **Schedule Workshop:** The User Researcher schedules a workshop with the NSF team to discuss user definition and preparation for future research work.
2. **Gather Required Participants:** NSF gathers the required participants from their team for the workshop.
3. **Confirm Participants & Schedule:** The NSF confirms the participants and the schedule for the workshop back to the User Researcher.
4. **Prepare Workshop Material:** The User Researcher prepares all the necessary materials for the workshop, focusing on user definitions and identifying future research work.
5. **Conduct Workshop:** The workshop is conducted, where various aspects such as cloud hosting needs (pertaining to cloud.gov) and CMS requirements are discussed, along with introducing user-centric design principles.
6. **Log Workshop Outcomes:** The outcomes and important points from the workshop are logged by the User Researcher, potentially for further reference and action planning.
7. **Assign Homework for NSF Team:** To ensure continuous engagement and deeper understanding, the User Researcher assigns homework to the NSF team.
8. **Follow-Up on Homework & Workshop Insights:** The User Researcher follows up with the NSF team on the homework assigned and further discusses insights from the workshop.
9. **Prep for Next Steps Based on Workshop:** Finally, the User Researcher prepares for the next steps in the project based on the outcomes and understanding achieved through the workshop.

This sequence diagram provides a comprehensive view of the steps involved in conducting a user definition workshop aimed at preparing the NSF and the project team for future user research works, highlighting the collaborative and iterative approach to user-centered project development.

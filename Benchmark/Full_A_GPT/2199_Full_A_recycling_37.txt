Given your project description and the specific user story you provided, I'll draft a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram illustrates the process flow from the moment a user decides to upload their weekly schedule to receiving recommendations for recycling centers.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB
participant "Recommendation Engine" as RE
participant "Email Service" as Email

User -> UI : Upload weekly schedule
UI -> Backend : Validate and process schedule
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Store schedule
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Confirmation
deactivate DB

Backend -> RE : Calculate recommendations based on schedule
activate RE
RE -> DB : Query available recycling centers
activate DB
DB --> RE : Recycling center data
deactivate DB

RE --> Backend : Best fit recycling center recommendations
deactivate RE
Backend -> Email : Send recommendations via email
activate Email
Email --> User : Email with recommendations
deactivate Email
deactivate Backend

```

This sequence diagram includes the basic components and interactions needed to reflect the user's story:

1. **User Interface (UI):** Where the user uploads their weekly schedule.
2. **Backend System:** Validates and processes the uploaded schedule.
3. **Database (DB):** Stores the userâ€™s schedule and holds data about recycling centers.
4. **Recommendation Engine (RE):** Calculates the best fit recycling center recommendations based on the user's schedule.
5. **Email Service:** Sends an email to the user with the recommended recycling centers.

Each component's role is depicted through interactions that lead to the user getting recommendations for recycling centers based on their uploaded schedule. Please note that for implementation, each interaction may involve more detailed steps depending on the specific technical requirements and architecture of the RecycleSmart platform.

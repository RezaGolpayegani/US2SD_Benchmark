Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram representing the user story of an NSF administrator who wishes to shadow the CMS (Content Management System) implementation as part of the "NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative." This diagram illustrates the interactions between the administrator, the development team, and the CMS during the shadowing process.

Please note, this diagram provides a simplified view focused on key interactions related to the user story. To use this PlantUML code, you'll need to have PlantUML installed on your system or use an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "NSF Administrator" as admin
participant "Project Manager" as pm
participant "Development Team" as dev
participant "CMS" as cms

admin -> pm : Express desire to shadow CMS implementation
pm -> dev : Communicate administrator's request
note right of dev : Plan shadowing sessions\nand tasks for admin
dev -> dev : Schedule shadowing sessions
dev -> admin : Inform about shadowing schedule
admin -> dev : Join scheduled shadowing sessions
loop during shadowing sessions
    dev -> cms : Implement CMS features
    admin -> cms : Observe CMS implementation
    cms -> admin : Provide hands-on experience under guidance
end
admin -> pm : Provide feedback and reflections
pm -> dev : Share administrator's feedback
note over admin, cms : Feedback loop to refine CMS implementation

### How to Read This Diagram:
- **NSF Administrator (admin)**: This participant wants to learn about the CMS implementation process.
- **Project Manager (pm)**: Acts as the communication link between the NSF administrator and the development team.
- **Development Team (dev)**: Responsible for scheduling and facilitating the shadowing sessions as well as implementing CMS features.
- **CMS**: The content management system being implemented, shown here as an active participant in the learning process for illustrative purposes.

### Key Interactions:
1. **Expression of Interest**: The NSF administrator expresses a desire to shadow the CMS implementation.
2. **Communication and Scheduling**: The project manager communicates this request to the development team, who then schedules the shadowing sessions.
3. **Shadowing Sessions**: The NSF administrator joins the scheduled sessions, observing and even partaking in hands-on activities under guidance.
4. **Feedback**: After shadowing, the NSF administrator provides feedback, which is then shared by the project manager with the development team to refine the CMS implementation.

This diagram encapsulates how the NSF administrator aims to understand and learn from the CMS implementation process, ensuring their ability to manage and contribute to the siteâ€™s development effectively.

Given the project description and focusing on the user story provided, we can envisage a sequence diagram illustrating how an older person can select ALFRED to be wearable as a bracelet or a necklace, reflecting their preference for constant companionship and accessibility. This will cover the main interactions between the user, ALFRED (the system), and possibly the configuration interface that facilitates this customization. Unfortunately, I can't directly create visual content or diagrams, but I can provide you with a PlantUML script which you can use to generate the sequence diagram.

Here is an example of a PlantUML script that outlines the sequence of events based on your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED App" as app
participant "Wearable Configuration" as config
participant "ALFRED System" as system

user -> app: Open ALFRED App
app -> config: Access Wearable Options
config --> user: Display Options (Bracelet, Necklace)
user -> config: Selects 'Bracelet'
config -> system: Set Device as 'Bracelet'
system --> config: Confirmation
config --> user: Display Confirmation

user -> app: Close App

@enduml
```

This script represents the sequence where:
1. The older person (user) initiates the process by opening the ALFRED application.
2. The application provides access to the wearable configuration settings.
3. The older person is presented with options to wear ALFRED as either a bracelet or a necklace.
4. The user selects the 'Bracelet' option.
5. The configuration setting is communicated to the ALFRED system to set the device as a bracelet.
6. The system confirms the configuration change.
7. The confirmation is displayed to the user, letting them know ALFRED will now be worn as a bracelet.

To visualize this diagram, you would need to use a tool that supports PlantUML syntax, such as an online PlantUML editor, or integrate PlantUML with your development environment.

Remember, this is a simplified view tailored to your specific user story focusing on choosing ALFRED to be on a bracelet or a necklace. Depending on the complexities and functionalities of your actual system, interactions could be more detailed, incorporating more steps or involving additional system components.

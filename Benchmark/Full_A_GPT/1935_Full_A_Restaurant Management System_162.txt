Creating a detailed sequence diagram for your specified user story "As a manager, I want to list requests from other stores, so that I can help them if necessary," requires outlining the interactions between different system components and possibly external services or databases. The following sequence in PlantUML syntax represents these interactions, focusing on the essential steps to list requests from other stores within the Restaurant Management and Operations System context.

**Sequence Diagram in PlantUML:**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as mgr
participant "Management Interface" as mui
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Requests Database" as requestsDB
participant "Other Stores API" as storesAPI

== List Requests from Other Stores ==
mgr -> mui : Select "List Requests"
mui -> backend : GET /listRequests
backend -> requestsDB : Query all requests
requestsDB --> backend : Return requests
backend -> storesAPI : GET /externalRequests
storesAPI --> backend : Return external requests
backend -> mui : Display all requests
mui --> mgr : Show requests from other stores

@enduml
```

This diagram assumes a simple flow:

1. **Manager Interaction**: The manager initiates the action by selecting the option to list requests from other stores via a Management Interface.
2. **Management Interface to Backend**: This action triggers a GET request to the Backend Server to fetch the list of requests.
3. **Backend Server Queries**: The Backend Server then queries the Requests Database for all internal requests.
4. **Retrieving External Requests**: Simultaneously, the Backend Server makes a call to an External (Other Stores) API to fetch any request made by other stores.
5. **Combining Requests**: Both sets of requests (internal and external) are then combined.
6. **Displaying Requests**: The combined list is sent back to the Management Interface.
7. **Manager Views Requests**: Finally, the manager views all requests from both internal operations and other stores on the Management Interface.

This flow assumes integration with an external API for simplicity. In real-world applications, managing requests across stores might also involve more complex operations like authentication, authorization, and filtering based on managerial roles or store associations.

Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram to match the given user story requires specifying the interactions between the user (researcher) and the system components involved in viewing photo thumbnails and initiating a licensing request. Below is a simplified version of how such interactions might be diagrammed in PlantUML syntax. This diagram includes basic steps like the researcher searching for photos, the system retrieving and displaying thumbnails, and the researcher selecting a photo to license.

Please note that the actual system might involve more complexity, including authentication and authorization, access restrictions checks, and more detailed interactions with a database or file storage system. For simplicity, such complexities are not fully represented in this example.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as R
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Server" as S
database "Digital Archive Database" as DB
participant "Thumbnail Generator" as TG
participant "Licensing Interface" as LI

R -> SI : Enter search criteria
SI -> S : Request photos based on criteria
S -> DB : Query for photos
DB --> S : Return photo metadata
S -> TG : Request thumbnails
TG -> DB : Fetch photos
DB --> TG : Return photos
TG -> TG : Generate thumbnails
TG --> S : Return thumbnails
S --> SI : Display thumbnails
R -> SI : Select a photo
SI -> S : Request licensing for selected photo
S -> LI : Initiate licensing process
LI --> R : Display licensing form

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Researcher** initiates the process by entering search criteria into the **Search Interface**.
2. The **Search Interface** sends this criteria to the **Server**, which queries the **Digital Archive Database** for photos matching the criteria.
3. The **Digital Archive Database** returns metadata of the matching photos to the **Server**.
4. The **Server** requests the **Thumbnail Generator** to produce thumbnails for these photos.
5. The **Thumbnail Generator** fetches the actual photos from the **Digital Archive Database**, generates thumbnails, and sends them back to the **Server**.
6. The **Server** then commands the **Search Interface** to display these thumbnails to the **Researcher**.
7. The **Researcher** selects a photo to license.
8. The **Search Interface** communicates this selection to the **Server**, which triggers the **Licensing Interface** to start the licensing process.
9. The **Licensing Interface** presents a licensing form to the **Researcher**.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and can be further detailed or adjusted based on the specific system architecture, technologies used, and the project's requirements.

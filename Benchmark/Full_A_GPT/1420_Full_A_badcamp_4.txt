To visualize the process by which an attendee accesses a clear map of buildings and rooms for event navigation, we can outline a sequence diagram. This user story emphasizes the need for efficient event navigation to enhance the attendee's experience. Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, outlining the interaction between the user (attendee) and the system components involved in providing a map for event navigation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Attendee
participant "Event Website" as Website
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Map Interface" as Map

Attendee -> Website: Access event navigation section
Website -> DB: Query for venue details and map
DB -> Website: Return venue data and map links
Website -> Map: Request map rendering
Map -> Website: Provide interactive map of venues
Website -> Attendee: Display interactive map with buildings and rooms highlighted
Attendee -> Map: Interact with map (Zoom in/out, select room)
Map -> Attendee: Show detailed view/ directions to selected room

This sequence diagram focuses on the steps an attendee takes to access and utilize an interactive map provided on the BADCamp platform. It starts with the attendee accessing the event navigation section on the BADCamp website and ends with them interacting with the map to find their way to a class room. The process includes querying the database for venue details, rendering the map through a map interface, and presenting it to the attendee for interaction.

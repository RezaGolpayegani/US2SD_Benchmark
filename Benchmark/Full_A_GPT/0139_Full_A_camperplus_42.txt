Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a parent, I want to be able to sign and submit consent forms online, so that I don't have to deal with my child losing a consent form" involves outlining the interactions between the user (parent), the Platform (Camp Management & Communication Platform), and potentially other subsystems involved in the process like a database or an authentication service. Below is an example of how this could be represented in PlantUML format.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Parent as parent
participant "Platform Interface" as platform
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "Database" as db

parent -> platform : Access Platform
platform -> auth : Request Authentication
auth -> parent : Authenticate
parent -> auth : Provide Credentials
auth -> auth : Validate Credentials
auth -> platform : Authentication Successful

platform -> parent : Display Dashboard

parent -> platform : Select "Consent Forms"
platform -> db : Retrieve Consent Forms
db -> platform : Return Consent Forms
platform -> parent : Display Consent Forms

parent -> platform : Select "Sign & Submit"
platform -> parent : Display Form

parent -> platform : Sign Form Electronically
platform -> db : Save Signed Form
db -> platform : Confirm Form Saved

platform -> parent : Display Confirmation Message

```

This sequence diagram starts with the parent accessing the platform and going through the authentication process. Once authenticated and viewing their dashboard, they select the option for consent forms. The platform retrieves the available consent forms from the database and displays them to the parent. The parent then selects to sign and submit a form. The platform displays the form, the parent signs it electronically, and the platform saves this signed form in the database, finally confirming to the parent that the form has been successfully saved.

This visualization outlines the key steps involved in the process from the perspective of interactions among the system components. Depending on the actual implementation details of the platform, the steps might be slightly different or involve additional interactions with other services or subsystems.

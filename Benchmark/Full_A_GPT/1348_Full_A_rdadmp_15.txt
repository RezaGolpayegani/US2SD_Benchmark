Given the user story and project description, here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines how an IT staff member can get an estimate of the produced data volume to plan the overall storage consumption using the DMPTool.

Note: The following sequence diagram assumes a basic flow where the IT staff member interacts with the DMPTool, which in turn, collects data estimations from the researchers or principal investigators (PIs) and then processes this information to provide an estimated storage consumption.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "IT Staff Member" as IT
participant "DMPTool Interface" as UI
participant "Project Database" as DB
participant "Analysis Module" as Analysis
participant "Storage Estimation Tool" as Estimate

IT -> UI : Login to DMPTool
UI --> IT : Display Dashboard

IT -> UI : Navigate to Storage Estimation
UI -> DB : Fetch data project details
DB --> UI : Return project metadata

UI -> Analysis : Analyze data project requirements
Analysis -> Estimate : Retrieve data volume estimates
Estimate -> DB : Collect historical data estimates

DB --> Estimate : Historical data estimation
Estimate --> Analysis : Calculate estimated storage needs
Analysis --> UI : Present storage consumption estimation

UI --> IT : Display estimated storage consumption
IT -> UI : Review and plan resource allocation
UI -> DB : Update IT resource plan with new estimates
DB --> UI : Confirm update
UI --> IT : Show confirmation of update

This sequence diagram includes the following steps:
1. The IT staff member logs in to the DMPTool.
2. The DMPTool interface shows the dashboard.
3. The IT staff member navigates to the section where they can get an estimate of the storage consumption.
4. The DMPTool fetches the project details from the database.
5. The DMPTool analyzes the data project requirements.
6. The storage estimation tool retrieves data volume estimates, possibly also using historical data to aid in the calculation.
7. The storage estimation tool calculates the estimated storage needs.
8. The DMPTool interface presents the estimated storage consumption to the IT staff member.
9. The IT staff member reviews the estimation and plans resource allocation accordingly.
10. The IT staff member updates the IT resource plan with the new estimates in the DMPTool.
11. The DMPTool confirms the update.

This diagram is a high-level overview of the process and assumes direct interaction between the IT staff member and the DMPTool through its interface, where the tool gathers input, processes it, and returns useful output to assist in planning storage needs.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interaction between various components of the system when an employee wants to see the customer orders screen to keep track of customer orders. Below is a PlantUML description that captures this flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as E
participant "UI Application" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

== Employee Views Customer Orders ==
E -> UI: Selects to view customer orders
activate UI

UI -> Backend: GET /orders
activate Backend

Backend -> DB: Query customer orders
activate DB

DB --> Backend: Return orders data
deactivate DB

Backend --> UI: Show customer orders
deactivate Backend

UI --> E: Displays customer orders screen
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Employee interacts with the UI Application:** The sequence starts with the employee selecting to view customer orders through the user interface (UI) of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **UI requests Backend for data:** The UI then makes a request to the backend server, calling a hypothetical endpoint (GET /orders) designed to retrieve customer orders data.

3. **Backend communicates with Database:** Upon receiving the request from the UI, the backend server interacts with the database to query the required customer orders data.

4. **Database returns data to Backend:** The database processes the backend server's request and returns the relevant orders data.

5. **Backend sends data to UI:** With the data retrieved from the database, the backend server responds to the UI's request by sending back the customer orders data.

6. **UI displays Customer Orders to Employee:** Finally, the UI processes the data received from the backend server and displays the customer orders screen to the employee, allowing them to track and manage the orders accordingly.

This sequence diagram outlines the typical interactions and flow of information within the Restaurant Management and Operations System when an employee wants to view and track customer orders.

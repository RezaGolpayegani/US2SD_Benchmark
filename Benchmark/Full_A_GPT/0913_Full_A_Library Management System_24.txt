Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specific user story "As a librarian, I want to add a new book so that I can add the new book to the system" involves several components interacting with each other. Here's a simplified PlantUML code that outlines how different parts of the system interact in this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant Browser as B
participant WebServer as WS
database LibraryDB as DB

L -> B: Opens book addition form
B -> WS: GET request for book addition form
WS -> DB: Fetch form details
DB --> WS: Form details
WS --> B: Display book addition form
L --> B: Enters book details and submits form
B -> WS: POST book details
WS -> DB: Validate and save book details
DB --> WS: Confirmation of book addition
WS --> B: Display confirmation message
B --> L: Shows confirmation message

@enduml
```

Explanation:

1. **Librarian (L)**: The librarian initiates the process by opening the book addition form on their browser.
2. **Browser (B)**: Represents the interface the librarian interacts with. It sends a request to the Web Server to get the book addition form and later submits the completed book details.
3. **WebServer (WS)**: Acts as the middleman between the browser and the database. It processes the GET request for the form, handles the POST request of the new book details, and interacts with the database accordingly.
4. **LibraryDB (DB)**: The database where all data related to books and library operations are stored. It validates and saves the new book details sent by the Web Server.

This sequence diagram focuses on the high-level interactions for adding a new book to the system from the perspective of a librarian. It assumes the system already has a validated librarian session and the necessary interfaces for book addition and validation.

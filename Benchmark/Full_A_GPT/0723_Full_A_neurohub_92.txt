Given the specifics of your request, I'm going to lay out a conceptual approach for creating a sequence diagram focusing on the feature where a researcher wants to have the ability to search for files by file type and format in the context of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project. Below, I'll describe a basic scenario and then translate this into PlantUML code, a popular language for creating UML diagrams.

### Scenario Description:

1. The researcher accesses the Neurohub platform via a web interface.
2. The researcher navigates to the file search section.
3. The researcher inputs the desired file type and format into the search criteria fields.
4. The search request is sent to the server.
5. The server processes the request, querying the database for files matching the criteria.
6. The database returns the results to the server.
7. The server sends the search results back to the researcher.
8. The researcher views the results.

### PlantUML Code:
This code represents a PlantUML sequence diagram for the scenario described above.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as res
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant Server as srv
database "Neurohub Database" as db

res -> web: Access Neurohub platform
res -> web: Navigate to file search
res -> web: Input search criteria\n(file type and format)
web -> srv: Send search request
srv -> db: Query files by type and format
db --> srv: Return search results
srv --> web: Send back results
web --> res: Display search results

```

### How to Run This Code:

1. **Install PlantUML**: Make sure you have PlantUML installed. You can run PlantUML from a variety of environments including command line, integrated development environments (IDEs), and online tools.

2. **Use an Online Editor**: For those new to PlantUML or without the ability to run it locally, an online editor like PlantText (https://www.planttext.com/) can be very convenient. Simply paste the PlantUML code into the editor and view the generated sequence diagram.

3. **Adjust as Necessary**: This diagram is a starting point. Depending on further details of the Neurohub platform's architecture and functionality, you might need to adjust the participants (like adding an Authentication system if searches require login) or actions to match your project's specific requirements.

This sequence diagram provides a simplified overview of how the "search for files by file type and format" feature could work in the context of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project, serving as a foundational piece in planning and developing this functionality.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the defined user story, "As a staff, I want to checkout a book, so that I can keep track of books after reservation," involves depicting the interaction between various system components such as the Library Staff Interface, Reservation System, and Database.

### Here is a PlantUML code representing the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff
participant "Library Staff Interface" as Interface
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation
database "Database" as DB

== Checkout Process ==
Staff -> Interface : Request to checkout book
activate Interface
Interface -> Reservation : Verify if book is reserved
activate Reservation
Reservation -> DB : Check book status
activate DB
DB --> Reservation : Book is reserved and ready for checkout
deactivate DB
Reservation --> Interface : Reservation confirmed
deactivate Reservation
Interface -> DB : Update book status to 'Checked Out'
activate DB
DB --> Interface : Book status updated
deactivate DB
Interface --> Staff : Checkout successful
deactivate Interface
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Start**: The sequence begins with the library staff initiating a checkout request through the Library Staff Interface.

2. **Verify Reservation**: The Library Staff Interface then asks the Reservation System to verify if the book is reserved and ready for checkout.

3. **Check Book Status**: The Reservation System queries the Database to check the current status of the book.

4. **Confirmation**: The Database responds with the reservation and readiness status of the book.

5. **Update Book Status**: Upon confirmation that the book is reserved and ready, the Reservation System instructs the Database to update the book status to 'Checked Out'.

6. **Checkout Successful**: The Database updates the book status and confirms the operation's success back to the Library Staff Interface, which in turn notifies the staff member.

7. **End**: The checkout process is complete, and the book is successfully checked out to the customer who reserved it.

This PlantUML script lays out a straightforward yet detailed flow of operations, encapsulating steps from verifying a book's reservation status to successfully checking it out. You can easily adapt or extend this diagram to include more steps or details, such as handling errors or additional verifications (e.g., checking if a staff member is authorized to perform the checkout, or if there are any restrictions on the member's account).

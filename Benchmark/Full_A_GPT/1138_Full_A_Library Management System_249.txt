Given your request to generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a member, I want to display the location of a book in the library, so that I can find a book in the library," here is an illustrative sequence diagram to follow. This example focuses on the interaction between the user interface, system controllers, and the database for displaying a book's location within a library management system.

Please note, this sequence diagram is simplified for clarity and understanding of the primary interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
participant MemberUI as UI
participant BookSearchController as Controller
participant BookDatabase as Database
entity BookLocation as Location

UI -> Controller : searchBook(title, author)
Controller -> Database : getBookDetails(title, author)
Database -> Controller : return bookDetails
Controller -> Database : getBookLocation(bookID)
Database -> Location : fetchLocation(bookID)
Location -> Database : locationDetails
Database -> Controller : return locationDetails
Controller -> UI : displayBookLocation(locationDetails)

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Flow:
1. **MemberUI (Member User Interface)**: This represents the graphical user interface through which a library member interacts. It sends a request to search for a book by its title and/or author to the `BookSearchController`.
2. **BookSearchController**: Acts as the intermediary processing unit handling requests from the UI. It first retrieves the book details (including `bookID`) from the `BookDatabase` to ensure the book's existence.
3. **BookDatabase**: Stores and manages access to book data, including book details and location information. Upon request from the `BookSearchController`, it provides the book details and then the specific location of the requested book.
4. **BookLocation**: An entity within the database responsible for storing and providing access to the physical location of books in the library. This could include the aisle number, shelf number, or any other relevant location identifier.
5. Once the `BookSearchController` has the location details (from `BookDatabase` and `BookLocation`), it sends this information back to the `MemberUI`, where the member can view the location of the book in the library.

This sequence ensures that a member can easily find the physical location of a book within the library, making the process efficient and user-friendly.

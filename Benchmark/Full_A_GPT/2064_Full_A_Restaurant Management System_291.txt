Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for the described user story involves detailing the interaction between the system components, the waiter, and possibly the kitchen or order management system. Given the complexity, here's a simplified version focusing on the key steps a waiter would take to enter the quantity of order items using PlantUML code.

Please note, this sequence diagram is a high-level overview. Depending on the specific requirements and design of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, the actual interactions may vary.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter as waiter
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Order Management System" as oms
participant Database as db

waiter -> ui : Select "Enter Order"
ui -> oms : Fetch Order Form
oms -> db : Retrieve Menu Items
db -> oms : Menu Items Data
oms -> ui : Display Order Form
waiter -> ui : Choose Items & Enter Quantities
ui -> oms : Submit Order Quantities
oms -> db : Update Order Details
db -> oms : Confirmation
oms -> ui : Display Confirmation to Waiter
ui -> waiter : Show Success Message

Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Waiter selects "Enter Order" on the UI Interface**: This is the starting point where the waiter initiates the process of entering the quantity of order items.
2. **UI Interface requests the Order Form from the Order Management System (OMS)**: The user interface asks the OMS for the necessary form or page to enter the new order.
3. **OMS retrieves Menu Items from the Database**: The OMS needs to know what items can be ordered to provide the waiter with accurate options.
4. **Database sends Menu Items Data to OMS**: This data includes all available menu items to be displayed.
5. **OMS provides the UI Interface with the Order Form**: This form includes the menu items fetched from the database.
6. **Waiter chooses items and enters quantities on the UI Interface**: The waiter interacts with the UI, making selections and specifying quantities for each order item.
7. **UI Interface submits the Order Quantities to OMS**: After the waiter confirms, the entered details are sent to the order management system for processing.
8. **OMS updates Order Details in the Database**: The OMS processes the waiter's input and updates the order details accordingly.
9. **Database sends a Confirmation back to OMS**: This confirms that the order details have been successfully updated.
10. **OMS displays a Confirmation to the Waiter through the UI Interface**: This informs the waiter that the order has been successfully recorded.
11. **UI Interface shows a Success Message to the Waiter**: Finally, the waiter receives a success message, indicating that the process has been completed.

This sequence diagram abstracts certain details to focus on the interaction flow relevant to the waiter's task of entering order quantities. Depending on the system architecture, additional steps or services (like inventory management for stock deduction) might be involved.

Given the complexity of the entire Restaurant Management and Operations System project, a sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a restaurant employee, I want to log orders instantaneously so that the kitchen can start to prepare the food" requires focusing on the interaction between the restaurant employee, the system interface, and the backend services that manage orders and notify the kitchen. Below is a PlantUML code depicting these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant "Frontend\nInterface" as F
participant "Order Management\nSystem" as OMS
participant "Kitchen Display\nSystem" as KDS

E -> F: Selects 'Log New Order'
activate F
F -> OMS: Sends order details
activate OMS
OMS -> KDS: Forward order to kitchen
activate KDS
KDS -> OMS: Acknowledge order receipt
deactivate KDS
OMS -> F: Confirm order logged
deactivate OMS
F -> E: Display confirmation message
deactivate F

This diagram starts with the restaurant employee (E) selecting the option to log a new order through the Frontend Interface (F), which could be a tablet, a computer, or a mobile device equipped with the restaurant management application. The Frontend Interface sends the order details to the Order Management System (OMS), a backend service responsible for handling the order processes. Upon receiving the order details, the OMS forwards this information to the Kitchen Display System (KDS), which displays the order for the kitchen staff to start preparing the food. Once the KDS acknowledges receipt of the order information, it sends a confirmation back to the OMS. The OMS, in turn, confirms to the Frontend Interface that the order has been successfully logged and is being prepared. Finally, the Frontend Interface displays a confirmation message to the employee, completing the process.

This sequence effectively demonstrates the steps involved in logging an order and initiating its preparation in the kitchen, focusing on the system's responsiveness and efficiency, which are crucial for enhancing the dining experience and streamlining restaurant operations.

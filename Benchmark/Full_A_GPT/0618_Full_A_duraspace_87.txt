Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a DAMS manager, I want to know all the statutes pertinent to an object or object component," involves outlining the interactions between the DAMS manager, the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS), possibly the repository manager, and the systems that store and manage the copyright and legal information associated with digital objects or components. 

Given that PlantUML is a tool for generating UML diagrams from a plain text language, below is a simplistic representation of how the sequence might be outlined in PlantUML syntax. This script illustrates the process starting from the DAMS manager's request down to fetching and displaying the desired information.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant DAMSManager as DAMSM
actor "DIMS\nSystem" as DIMS
database "Digital Asset\nManagement System" as DAMS
database "Copyright & Legal\nInfo System" as CopyrightSys

== Request Statutes Pertinent to an Object or Component ==

DAMSM -> DIMS : Request statutes for Object/Component
activate DIMS

DIMS -> DAMS : Query object/component details
activate DAMS
DAMS --> DIMS : Object/Component details
deactivate DAMS

DIMS -> CopyrightSys : Request pertinent statutes based on object/component details
activate CopyrightDoSys
CopyrightSys --> DIMS : Lists pertinent statutes
deactivate CopyrightSys

DIMS --> DAMSM : Display pertinent statutes
deactivate DIMS

### Breakdown of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **DAMS Manager initiates the request:** The process starts when the DAMS manager requests information on all statutes pertinent to a specific object or object component.

2. **DIMS System processes the request:** DIMS receives the request and first queries details about the object or component from the Digital Asset Management System.

3. **Fetching Object/Component Details:** The DAMS returns details about the requested object or component to DIMS. These details are necessary to identify the right statutes.

4. **Querying Copyright & Legal Info System:** DIMS then forwards these details to query the Copyright & Legal Info System, which manages copyright, statutes, licenses, and policies applicable to the objects or components.

5. **Returning the Pertinent Statutes:** The Copyright & Legal Info System provides a list of all pertinent statutes based on the details provided. This list is then sent back to DIMS.

6. **Displaying Information to the DAMS Manager:** Finally, DIMS displays the list of pertinent statutes to the DAMS manager, completing the request.

### Notes:
- The sequence assumes direct communication between DIMS and other system components like the DAMS and Copyright & Legal Info System, which might require API calls or database queries in a real-world scenario.
- Depending on the complexity and setup of the DIMS and associated systems, additional steps or alternative paths (e.g., error handling, authentication) could be necessary but are not shown in this simplified representation.

This sequence diagram is a high-level illustration. Detailed implementations may vary based on specific project requirements and the technical architecture of the systems involved.

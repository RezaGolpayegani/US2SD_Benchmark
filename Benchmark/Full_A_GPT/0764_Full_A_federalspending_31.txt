Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story: "As a Developer, I want to update the FABS sample file to remove FundingAgencyCode after FABS is updated to no longer require the header," involves depicting the sequence of interactions between the Developer and the components of the system in updating the FABS sample file. Below is a representation in PlantUML format. Note that PlantUML code can be compiled in an environment that supports PlantUML. This diagram assumes a basic workflow.

PlantUML code for the requested sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "FABS Update System" as FABS
participant "Sample File Repository" as Repository
participant "Version Control System" as VCS
database "Update Log" as Log

Developer -> FABS: Check if FABS header updated 
activate FABS
FABS --> Developer: Confirm header no longer requires FundingAgencyCode
deactivate FABS

Developer -> Repository: Access existing FABS sample file
activate Repository
Repository --> Developer: Provide FABS sample file
deactivate Repository

Developer -> Developer: Remove FundingAgencyCode from sample file

Developer -> VCS: Push updated sample file
activate VCS
VCS --> Developer: Confirm file updated
deactivate VCS

Developer -> Log: Log update action
activate Log
Log --> Developer: Confirm action logged
deactivate Log

```

This diagram illustrates a sequence where the Developer:
1. Checks with the FABS Update System if the FABS header was updated to no longer require the `FundingAgencyCode`.
2. Upon confirmation, the Developer accesses the existing FABS sample file from the Sample File Repository.
3. The Developer then removes the `FundingAgencyCode` from the sample file.
4. The updated sample file is pushed to a Version Control System.
5. Finally, the update action is logged in an Update Log.

Adjustments to the sequence might be necessary based on the specific infrastructure and workflow at your organization. This diagram provides a generic workflow that fits the given user story.

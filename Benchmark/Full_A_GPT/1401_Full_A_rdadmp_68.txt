Given your request for a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story, below is an outline of how the sequence might look for a Research Evaluation Manager ensuring all data are quoted correctly with the institution's affiliation. Please note that to produce an actual working diagram, you would need to use a PlantUML environment or compatible tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Research Evaluation Manager" as manager
participant DMPTool
participant "Metadata System" as metadata
participant "Repository Owner" as repository
participant "Institutional System" as institution

== Ensure Correct Citation ==
manager -> DMPTool: Access project data details
activate DMPTool
DMPTool -> metadata: Query metadata for projects
activate metadata
metadata --> DMPTool: Return project metadata
deactivate metadata

DMPTool -> DMPTool: Validate citation format
DMPTool --> manager: Show current citation details
manager -> DMPTool: Request update for affiliation
activate DMPTool
DMPTool -> repository: Check data provenance
activate repository
repository --> DMPTool: Confirm data source
deactivate repository

DMPTool -> institution: Retrieve institutional affiliation details
activate institution
institution --> DMPTool: Provide affiliation details
deactivate institution

DMPTool -> metadata: Update metadata with correct affiliation
activate metadata
metadata --> DMPTool: Confirm metadata update
deactivate metadata

DMPTool --> manager: Confirm update of citations with correct affiliation
deactivate DMPTool

This diagram outlines the sequence of interactions between the Research Evaluation Manager and the DMPTool, as well as with various systems (metadata, repository, and institutional) to ensure the data are correctly quoted with the institution's affiliation. Note that actual interactions might be more complex and require authentication, error handling, etc., which are not detailed in this high-level depiction.

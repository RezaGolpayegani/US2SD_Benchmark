To address this request effectively, we'll be creating a PlantUML diagram that represents the sequence of actions and decisions that lead up to determining the viability of the blog aggregator for the NSF Beta Site. The scenario outlined will include interactions among stakeholders, the development team, and the results from user research.

Please note that due to the constraints of this platform, I'll describe how the sequence diagram should be structured rather than generating a live code that renders directly into an image. You can then take this description and input it into a PlantUML editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Stakeholder
participant ProjectManager as "Project Manager"
participant UserResearchTeam as "User Research Team"
participant DevTeam as "Development Team"
participant CMS as "Content Management System"

Stakeholder -> ProjectManager: Request evaluation of blog aggregator
ProjectManager -> UserResearchTeam: Initiate research on blog aggregator viability
activate UserResearchTeam

UserResearchTeam -> UserResearchTeam: Perform in-person interviews
UserResearchTeam -> UserResearchTeam: Conduct usability testing on CMS
UserResearchTeam -> UserResearchTeam: Review effectiveness of existing aggregators
UserResearchTeam -> ProjectManager: Report findings

deactivate UserResearchTeam
ProjectManager -> DevTeam: Discuss technical feasibility
activate DevTeam
DevTeam -> CMS: Assess CMS integration capabilities
CMS --> DevTeam: Provide integration feedback
DevTeam -> ProjectManager: Recommend course of action based on technical assessment
deactivate DevTeam

ProjectManager -> Stakeholder: Present findings and recommendations
activate Stakeholder
Stakeholder -> Stakeholder: Make decision based on findings
Stakeholder -> ProjectManager: Communicate decision
ProjectManager -> DevTeam: [If aggregator viable] Implement blog aggregator
ProjectManager -> DevTeam: [If aggregator not viable] Explore alternatives
deactivate Stakeholder

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Stakeholder Requests Evaluation**: The sequence begins when a stakeholder requests an evaluation of the blog aggregator's viability for the beta site of NSF.

2. **Project Manager Initiates Research**: The project manager forwards this request to the user research team to start the evaluation process.

3. **User Research Team Conducts Evaluation**: The user research team undertakes a series of actions such as performing interviews, conducting usability tests on CMS, and reviewing the effectiveness of existing blog aggregators.

4. **Report Findings**: The findings from these activities are compiled and reported back to the project manager.

5. **Technical Feasibility Discussion**: The project manager discusses these findings with the development team to assess the technical feasibility and integration capabilities with the CMS.

6. **Recommendation**: Based on technical assessment and research findings, the development team recommends a course of action to the project manager.

7. **Presentation to Stakeholder**: The project manager presents the findings and recommendations to the stakeholder.

8. **Decision Made by Stakeholder**: The stakeholder reviews the presented information, makes a decision, and communicates this back to the project manager.

9. **Implementation or Exploration of Alternatives**: Based on the stakeholder's decision, the project manager instructs the development team to either implement the blog aggregator (if deemed viable) or explore alternatives (if it's not viable).

This sequence diagram outlines the comprehensive process of decision-making regarding the implementation of a blog aggregator, based on research findings, technical feasibility, and stakeholder input.

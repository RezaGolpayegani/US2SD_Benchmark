To illustrate the sequence of interactions for the user story "As a cook, I want to create new customer orders" in the context of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, we will use PlantUML to create a sequence diagram. This diagram will capture how the cook interacts with the system components to fulfill their goal.

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

1. **Order Initiation**: The cook initiates the creation of a new customer order using the Order Management System (OMS).

2. **Menu Item Retrieval**: The OMS queries the database to retrieve a list of available menu items to display to the cook.

3. **Display Menu Items**: The OMS displays the available menu items to the cook.

4. **Selection of Menu Items & Quantities**: The cook selects the desired menu items along with their quantities.

5. **Availability Check**: The OMS checks the availability of the selected items with the Inventory Management system.

6. **Stock Retrieval**: The Inventory Management system retrieves current stock details for the selected items from the database.

7. **Confirmation of Available Items**: The OMS informs the cook of the availability status of the selected items.

8. **Order Confirmation**: The cook confirms the order details, and the OMS proceeds to create a new order in the database.

9. **Order Creation Confirmation**: The database confirms the creation of the new order, and the OMS displays the order confirmation to the cook.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the cook, the Order Management System, Inventory Management, and the database to facilitate the creation of a new customer order within the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

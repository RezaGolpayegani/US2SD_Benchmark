Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to reserve a book" involves representing the sequence of operations between objects or components as you interact with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). The actors and systems involved typically include the Member (User), Frontend Interface, Reservation System, Database, and Notification System.

We'll outline the steps for this specific user story in PlantUML format, focusing on interactions from searching for a book to successfully reserving it.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "Frontend Interface" as frontend
participant "Reservation System" as reservationSystem
database "Database" as database
participant "Notification System" as notification

== Search for Book ==
member -> frontend : Search(bookDetails)
frontend -> reservationSystem: Query(bookDetails)
reservationSystem -> database: Fetch(bookDetails)
database --> reservationSystem: BookResults
reservationSensitiveArea --> frontend: DisplayResults(BookResults)
frontend --> member: ShowBookResults

== Select Book to Reserve ==
member -> frontend : SelectBook(BookID)
frontend -> reservationSystem: CheckAvailability(BookID)
reservationSystem -> database: GetAvailability(BookID)
database --> reservationSystem: AvailabilityStatus

alt If Book is Available
    reservationSystem --> frontend: ShowAvailable
    frontend --> member: PromptReserveOption
    member -> frontend : ConfirmReserve(BookID)
    frontend -> reservationSystem: ReserveBook(MemberID, BookID)
    reservationSystem -> database: UpdateReservation(MemberID, BookID)
    database --> reservationSystem: ReservationSuccess
    reservationSystem --> notification: SendReservationNotification(MemberID, BookID)
    notification --> member: DisplayNotification(ReservationConfirmed)

else If Book is Not Available
    reservationSystem --> frontend: ShowNotAvailable
    frontend --> member: ShowWaitlistOption
    member -> frontend : ConfirmWaitlist(BookID)
    frontend -> reservationSystem: AddToWaitlist(MemberID, BookID)
    reservationSystem -> database: UpdateWaitlistStatus(MemberID, BookID)
    database --> reservationSystem: WaitlistSuccess
    reservationSystem --> notification: SendWaitlistNotification(MemberID, BookID)
    notification --> member: DisplayNotification(AddedToWaitlist)
end

This diagram outlines the fundamental sequence from the member's perspective of reserving a book through the CLMS, considering both cases: when the book is available and when it's not, leading to a waitlist scenario. Each interaction is captured in sequence, showing how the user's actions trigger system processes and how the system responds at each step.

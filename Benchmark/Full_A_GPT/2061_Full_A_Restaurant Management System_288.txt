Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a waiter, I want to display the stock status of items, so that I can inform customers," involves depicting the interaction between the waiter, the restaurant management system, and the inventory management system. Below is the PlantUML code to represent these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as WInterface
participant "System Backend" as Backend
participant "Inventory Management" as Inventory
participant "Database" as DB

== Check Stock Status ==

Waiter -> WInterface : Select "Check Stock Status"
WInterface -> Backend : Request stock info
Backend -> Inventory : Query stock status
Inventory -> DB : Fetch stock status
DB -> Inventory : Return stock data
Inventory -> Backend : Send stock data
Backend -> WInterface : Display stock status
WInterface -> Waiter : Show stock status to Waiter

This sequence diagram starts with the waiter deciding to check the stock status of items to inform customers accurately. Here's a step-by-step walkthrough:

1. **Waiter Initiates**: The waiter selects a "Check Stock Status" option through a waiter interface, which could be a digital device such as a tablet or a computer system designed for staff use.

2. **System Backend Processes Request**: The waiter interface sends a request to the system backend, asking for the stock information of items.

3. **Inventory Management Queries**: The backend forwards this request to the inventory management system component, which is responsible for managing the stock levels of the restaurant's items.

4. **Database Interaction**: The inventory management system queries the database to fetch the current stock status of the items. This could involve querying a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on the technology stack mentioned in the project.

5. **Database Responds**: The database returns the requested stock data to the inventory management system.

6. **Information Returned to Backend**: The inventory management system processes and sends the stock data back to the system backend.

7. **Displaying Stock Status**: Finally, the backend sends the stock status information to the waiter interface, where it's displayed to the waiter.

8. **Waiter Informed**: The waiter views the stock status on the interface and is now informed about which items are available or low in stock, and can relay this information accurately to customers, improving the dining experience and preventing potential issues with order fulfillment.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level understanding of the interactions involved in checking and displaying the stock status of items within a restaurant management and operations system.

Given the nature and complexity of the DPIE system and the specific requirements of the user story, the PlantUML sequence diagram outlined below represents a possible interaction between the user (in this case, a researcher or government publisher) and various system components when adding reference data on inflation to a spending dataset. This diagram is a high-level abstraction and can be refined based on additional requirements or system constraints.

Editor --> Researcher : Display dataset structure

Researcher -> Editor : Request to add inflation data
Editor -> RefAPI : Query inflation reference data
RefAPI -> Editor : Return inflation data

Editor --> Researcher : Preview updated dataset
Researcher -> Editor : Approve data addition

Editor -> Validation : Validate dataset with inflation data
Validation -> Editor : Return validation success

Editor -> Storage : Save enhanced dataset
Storage --> Editor : Confirmation of saved dataset
Editor --> Researcher : Confirm dataset enhancement completion

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:**

1. **Select dataset for enhancement:** The researcher or government publisher initiates the process by selecting the dataset they wish to enhance with inflation data through the DPIE user interface.

2. **Open DataPackage Editor:** DPIE opens the DataPackage Editor, which allows the user to modify and enhance their datasets.

3. **Display dataset structure:** The DataPackage Editor shows the structure of the dataset to the researcher, enabling them to understand the current data and how the inflation data can be integrated.

4. **Request to add inflation data:** The researcher requests the integration of inflation reference data into their dataset.

5. **Query inflation reference data:** The DataPackage Editor contacts a Reference Data API to retrieve the relevant inflation data.

6. **Return inflation data:** The Reference Data API sends back the requested inflation data to be integrated into the dataset.

7. **Preview updated dataset:** The researcher is given a preview of the dataset with the newly integrated inflation data for approval.

8. **Approve data addition:** If satisfied with the integration, the researcher approves the addition of the inflation data.

9. **Validate dataset with inflation data:** The modified dataset is sent to a Validation Service to ensure that it meets the necessary standards and formats for Data Packages and that the inflation data is correctly integrated.

10. **Return validation success:** The Validation Service returns a success message indicating that the dataset with the added inflation data has passed all validation checks.

11. **Save enhanced dataset:** The enhanced dataset is then saved to a Data Storage solution, ensuring that the new version is available for access and use.

12. **Confirmation of saved dataset:** The Data Storage solution confirms that the dataset has been successfully saved.

13. **Confirm dataset enhancement completion:** Finally, the DataPackage Editor informs the researcher that the dataset enhancement process is complete, making the spending dataset with integrated inflation data available for analysis and sharing.

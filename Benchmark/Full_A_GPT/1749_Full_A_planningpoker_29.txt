Given the requirements and context provided, below is a detailed sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format for the user story: "As an estimator, I want to join a game by entering my name on the page I received the URL for, so that I can participate." This diagram outlines the interaction between the system components when an estimator attempts to join a game.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant "Join Game Form" as JGF
participant "Game Server" as GS
database "Game Database" as GD

UI -> JGF: Enter URL
note over JGF: URL contains game ID
JGF -> JGF: Validate URL format
alt URL is valid
    JGF -> UI: Request Name Input
    UI -> JGF: Submit Name
    JGF -> GS: Request to join game (Name, Game ID)
    GS -> GD: Check Game Status (Game ID)
    alt Game exists and is accepting players
        GD -> GS: Game details
        GS -> GD: Add Estimator (Name, Game ID)
        GD --> GS: Confirmation
        GS -> UI: Join Success
        UI -> UserInterface : Display Game Session
    else Game does not exist or not accepting
        GS -> UI: Error Message (Game not available)
    end
else URL is invalid
    JGF -> UI: Error Message (Invalid URL)
end

**Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Enter URL:** The estimator interacts with the User Interface (UI) where they enter the URL they received, which directs them to the Join Game Form (JGF).

2. **Validate URL format:** The JGF checks if the URL structure contains a game ID and is in a valid format.

3. **URL Validity Outcomes:**
   - **If the URL is valid:**
     - The form requests the estimator to input their name.
     - The estimator submits their name through the UI.
     - The Join Game Form sends a request to join the game, including the submitted name and the game ID extracted from the URL, to the Game Server (GS).
     - The Game Server checks with the Game Database (GD) if the game exists and is currently accepting new players.
     - If the game is found and is open for joining:
       - The Game Database updates to add the estimator to the game.
       - The Game Server confirms the addition to the UI, and the estimator is successfully added to the game session.
     - If the game does not exist or is not accepting new players:
       - The Game Server sends an error message to the UI indicating the game is not available.
   - **If the URL is invalid:**
     - The Join Game Form sends an error message to the UI indicating the URL is invalid.

This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction flow for an estimator attempting to join an agile estimation game using a provided URL.

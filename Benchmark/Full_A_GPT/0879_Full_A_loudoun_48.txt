Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves showing the interaction between the Inspection Staff member and the County Services & Property Information Portal with the focus on creating, scheduling, and assigning an inspection. Below is a PlantUML representation of this process.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you will need to use a PlantUML environment or integrator. This could be an online editor like PlantText.com, or an integration within a documentation tool that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Inspection Staff" as staff
participant "Customer Portal" as portal
participant "Inspection Management System" as ims
database "Inspection Database" as db

== Authentication ==
staff -> portal : Login
portal -> staff : Authentication Successful

== Create Inspection ==
staff -> portal : Select "Create Inspection"
portal -> ims : Initiate Inspection Creation
ims -> db : Retrieve Required Info(template, areas, inspectors)
db --> ims : Return Info
ims --> portal : Display Inspection Form(with Info)
portal -> staff : Display Form
staff -> portal : Fill Form and Submit
portal -> ims : Process Inspection Submission
ims -> db : Save New Inspection Details
db --> ims : Confirmation
ims --> portal : Acknowledge Creation
portal -> staff : Display "Inspection Scheduled"

== Assign Inspection ==
staff -> portal : Access Pending Inspections
portal -> ims : Request Pending Inspections
ims -> db : Query Pending Inspections
db --> ims : Return Pending Inspections
ims --> portal : Display Pending Inspections
portal -> staff : Show Pending Inspections
staff -> portal : Select Inspection to Assign
portal -> ims : Initiate Assignment Process
staff -> portal : Select Inspector and Assign
portal -> ims : Update Inspection with Assignee
ims -> db : Save Inspector Assignment
db --> ims : Confirmation
ims --> portal : Acknowledge Assignment
portal -> staff : Display "Inspection Assigned"

This sequence diagram begins with the Inspection Staff member logging into the Customer Portal. Once authenticated, the staff member selects the option to create an inspection, filling out the necessary form that gets displayed after the portal communicates with the Inspection Management System (IMS). The IMS, in turn, interacts with the Inspection Database to retrieve and store information related to the inspection. Following the creation of the inspection, the diagram depicts the process of assigning this newly created inspection to an inspector, which also involves interactions between the portal, the IMS, and the database to update and confirm the assignment.

Please adjust the specific names of the systems, databases, or interfaces (`Customer Portal`, `Inspection Management System`, `Inspection Database`) as required for your actual project setup.

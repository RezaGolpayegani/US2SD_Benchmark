Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As an archivist, I want to access the digital files on the X-drive, so that I can use them" involves illustrating the interaction between an archivist and various system components involved in accessing digital files. Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax to visualize this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "Authentication\nSystem" as Auth
participant "User Management\nSystem" as UserMgmt
participant "File Management\nSystem" as FileManager
participant "Access Restriction\nControls" as AccessControl
database XDrive as xdrive

== Authentication Process ==
archivist -> Auth: Submits Credentials
Auth -> UserMgmt: Validates Credentials
UserMgmt --> Auth: Authentication Success
Auth --> archivist: Access Granted

== Accessing Files ==
archivist -> FileManager : Requests Access to X-drive
FileManager -> AccessControl: Verify Permissions
AccessControl -> UserMgmt: Retrieve Archivist Permissions
UserMgmt --> AccessControl: Permissions Details
AccessControl --> FileManager: Access Permitted
FileManager -> xdrive: Fetch Files
xdrive --> FileManager: Returns Requested Files
FileManager --> archivist: Displays Files

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Above:**

1. **Authentication Process:**
   - The archivist submits their credentials (e.g., username and password) to the Authentication System.
   - The Authentication System validates these credentials with the User Management System.
   - Upon successful authentication, the Authentication System grants access to the archivist.

2. **Accessing Files:**
   - The archivist requests access to digital files stored on the X-drive via the File Management System.
   - The File Management System then verifies the archivist's permissions with the Access Restriction Controls.
   - The Access Restriction Controls retrieve the archivist's permission details from the User Management System.
   - Once access is permitted by the Access Restriction Controls, the File Management System fetches the requested files from the X-drive.
   - Finally, the retrieved files are displayed to the archivist by the File Management System.

This sequence diagram outlines the essential steps involved when an archivist attempts to access digital files on the X-drive, including authentication, permission verification, file fetching, and file display processes.

To illustrate the user story "As a site visitor, I want to know as I glance around the home page what on earth a CSM is and why I'd want to be one, so that I read more," using a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, we need to outline the sequence of interactions between the site visitor and the Scrum Alliance Community Platform, focusing on the discovery of what a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) is.

Below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format for this user story. This diagram follows a simple interaction pattern where the user accesses the home page, is presented with information about CSM, chooses to learn more, and then is directed to detailed information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Visitor as "Site Visitor"
participant HomePage as "Home Page"
participant CSMSection as "CSM Info Section"
participant MoreInfo as "CSM More Information Page"

Visitor -> HomePage: Access
activate HomePage

HomePage -> CSMSection: Display Brief CSM Info
activate CSMSection
CSMSection --> Visitor: Show CSM Benefits & Why
deactivate CSMSection

Visitor -> CSMSection: Choose to Learn More
activate CSMSection

CSMSection -> MoreInfo: Navigate to Detail
activate MoreInfo
MoreInfo --> Visitor: Provide Detailed CSM info
deactivate MoreInfo
deactivate CSMSection

This sequence diagram starts with a "Site Visitor" accessing the "Home Page." The home page, in response, displays a section dedicated to CSM (Certified ScrumMaster) information ("CSM Info Section"), briefly explaining what a CSM is and why it's beneficial. Interested in learning more, the visitor interacts with this section, prompting navigation to a more detailed information page about CSM ("CSM More Information Page"), where comprehensive details are provided.

Keep in mind, this is a simplified view. Depending on the complexity of interactions and the design specifics of the website, more elements and interactions could be added. For instance, if there are dynamic elements like pop-ups for quick info or user actions like signing up for a newsletter for more information, these would require additional sequences in the diagram.

To create a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story mentioned, we'll outline the interactions involved in creating a Customer Portal User Account. This diagram represents the steps a customer would take to register an account on the County Services & Property Information Portal and the systems involved in this process.

The sequence diagram below details the process from the customer's standpoint, interacting with the portal's UI, the authentication system, and possibly a database for account storage and retrieval. Note this example focuses on the interactions without getting into the specifics of the underlying technology or database structures.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer as customer
participant "Portal UI" as portal
participant "Authentication System" as auth
database "Accounts Database" as db

customer -> portal : Request to Create Account
portal -> customer : Display Account Creation Form
customer -> portal : Submit Account Details (username, email, password)
portal -> auth : Validate Account Details
alt Details Valid
    auth -> portal : Confirm Details Valid
    portal -> db : Create New User Account
    db -> portal : Confirm Account Created
    portal -> customer : Display Account Creation Success
    portal -> auth : Initiate First-Time Login Sequence
    auth -> customer : Request Authentication (Login)
    customer -> auth : Provide Credentials
    auth -> db : Validate Credentials
    db -> auth : Confirm Credentials Valid
    auth -> customer : Authentication Successful
else Details Invalid
    auth -> portal : Error (Details Invalid)
    portal -> customer : Display Error (Invalid Details)
end

```

In this diagram:
- The **Customer** interacts with the **Portal UI** to request account creation and submits their desired account details.
- The **Portal UI** forwards the details to the **Authentication System** to validate these details.
    - If details are valid, the **Authentication System** informs the **Portal UI**, which then interacts with the **Accounts Database** to create the new user account.
    - Once the account is successfully created, the **Portal UI** notifies the customer of the success and initiates a first-time login sequence to authenticate the customer.
    - The **Authentication System** validates the credentials against the **Accounts Database** and, if valid, authenticates the session.
- If details are invalid at any validation step, the customer is notified of the error and can attempt to correct the details.

This sequence diagram simplifies complex backend processes, such as security measures during account creation (e.g., password hashing) and the handling of sessions or tokens for user authentication, as these usually depend on specific implementation details not covered in the user story.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story using PlantUML, you must first understand the basic flow of events when an app developer wants to explore a dataset instance that was deployed as part of an app. This understanding is crucial for writing accurate PlantUML syntax to generate the diagram. Below is a simplified flow followed by the PlantUML code to visualize the process.

### Simplified Flow:
1. The app developer requests to explore a dataset instance from the application interface.
2. The application interface queries the Dataset Management System (DMS) to fetch the dataset type details associated with the app.
3. The DMS checks if the dataset type is deployed with the app.
4. Upon confirmation, the DMS retrieves the specific dataset instance details.
5. The dataset instance details, including configurations, properties, and schemas, are sent back to the application interface.
6. The app developer explores the dataset instance details through the application interface.

### PlantUML Code:
```plantuml
@startuml
participant AppDeveloper as developer
participant "Application Interface" as appInterface
participant "Dataset Management System" as DMS

developer -> appInterface : Request to explore dataset instance
appInterface -> DMS : Query dataset type details \nassociated with app
activate DMS
DMS -> DMS : Check if dataset type \nis deployed with app
DMS --> appInterface : Confirm dataset type is deployed
appInterface -> DMS : Retrieve dataset instance details
DMS -> DMS : Fetch dataset instance details
DMS --> appInterface : Dataset instance details \n(configurations, properties, schemas)
deactivate DMS
appInterface -> developer : Display dataset instance details
developer -> developer : Explore dataset instance details

### Notes:
- **AppDeveloper**: Represents the app developer initiating the action.
- **Application Interface**: This could be a graphical interface or command line from which the app developer interacts with the application.
- **Dataset Management System (DMS)**: The backend system handling dataset management and version control as per the project description.

This code should be placed within a PlantUML environment (online editor, IDE plugin, or other PlantUML compatible tools) to visualize the diagram. The diagram depicts the sequence of interactions between the app developer, the application interface, and the Dataset Management System to achieve the goal of exploring a dataset instance that was deployed as part of an app.

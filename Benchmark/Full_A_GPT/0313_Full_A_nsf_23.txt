To turn the described user story into a detailed sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax, we will focus on the interaction between the CMS administrator and the CMS system itself. This entails the administrator assigning roles to users within the system. For simplicity, interactions like authentication and authorization are not explicitly detailed but are assumed as prior steps in a real-world scenario.

Please note, the PlantUML code below is a textual representation meant to be compiled by a PlantUML processor (or compatible tool) to generate the visual sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "CMS System" as cms
participant "Database" as db

== Role Assignment Sequence ==

admin -> cms : Log into CMS
activate admin
activate cms

cms -> db : Validate admin credentials
activate db
db -> cms : Confirmation
deactivate db

cms -> admin : Display dashboard
admin -> cms : Navigate to user management section
cms -> admin : Display user list

admin -> cms : Select user to assign role
activate admin
admin -> cms : Choose role from dropdown
cms -> db : Update user with new role
activate db
db -> db : Save changes
db -> cms : Confirm role assignment
deactivate db

cms -> admin : Display success message
deactivate admin
deactivate cms

This sequence diagram starts with the CMS administrator logging into the CMS system. Once authenticated, the administrator navigates to the user management section, where they can see a list of users. The administrator selects a user and assigns them a role using a dropdown menu of available roles. The CMS system then updates the user's information in the database, saves the changes, and confirms the role assignment to the administrator by displaying a success message.

This sequence is a simplified representation focusing on the core interactions related to role assignment within a CMS, as per the provided user story. Further detail can be added to represent more specific interactions or error handling as required.

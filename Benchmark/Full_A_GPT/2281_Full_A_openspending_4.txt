Given your request, here's a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format describing the user story sequence for a Platform Administrator who wants to hide a public dataset on the OpenSpending platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Platform Administrator" as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
database "Dataset Database" as database
participant "OpenSpending API" as api

== Hide Public Dataset ==
admin -> dashboard : Select dataset to hide
dashboard -> database : Query dataset details
database -> dashboard : Return dataset details
dashboard -> admin : Show dataset details
admin -> dashboard : Request to hide dataset
dashboard -> api : Call hideDataset API
api -> database : Update dataset status to hidden
database -> api : Confirm dataset status update
api -> dashboard : Confirm dataset is now hidden
dashboard -> admin : Display confirmation message

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the interaction flow from the perspective of a Platform Administrator who intends to hide a dataset previously made public. The steps illustrate the administrator's interaction with the admin dashboard, triggering an API call to change the dataset's status in the database, and ultimately confirming the action back to the administrator.

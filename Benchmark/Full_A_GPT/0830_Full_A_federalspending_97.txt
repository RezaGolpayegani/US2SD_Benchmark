Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided requires a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interactions between different components and actors within the system. Since the Comprehensive Broker Platform Enhancement Project aims to improve the user interface and enhance the data submission and validation process among other improvements, the sequence diagram for an agency user navigating to either FABS or DABS pages could be depicted as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Agency User" as user
participant "Landing Page" as landing
participant "Navigation Controller" as navController
participant "FABS Page" as fabs
participant "DABS Page" as dabs

user -> landing: Access Landing Page
landing -> navController: Request page options
navController -> landing: Display FABS and DABS options
user -> landing: Selects FABS

alt User selects FABS
    landing -> navController: Redirect to FABS
    navController -> fabs: Show FABS Page
    fabs -> user: FABS information displayed
else User selects DABS
    landing -> navController: Redirect to DABS
    navController -> dabs: Show DABS Page
    dabs -> user: DABS information displayed
end
@enduml
```

Explanation of the sequence:
1. **Agency User Accesses Landing Page:** The agency user initiates the process by accessing the landing page of the Broker platform.
2. **Request Page Options:** The Landing Page communicates with the Navigation Controller to request the available page options for navigation, which, in this context, are FABS and DABS pages.
3. **Display FABS and DABS Options:** The Navigation Controller sends the available options back to the Landing Page, which then presents these options to the user.
4. **User Selection:** Depending on the user's selection (in this case, FABS is assumed), the Landing Page communicates the selection to the Navigation Large Controller.
5. **Redirect and Display Selected Page:** The Navigation Controller facilitates the redirection to the selected page (FABS or DABS), and the respective page is then displayed to the user with relevant information.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of how an agency user navigates from the landing page to either the FABS or DABS pages within the Broker platform, reflecting the goals of enhancing navigability and user satisfaction through the Comprehensive Broker Platform Enhancement Project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story involves various actors and components interacting to ensure that duplicate submissions are identified and prevented, thus maintaining the integrity of the survey or feedback mechanism for trainers. Below is a simplified representation of such a process in PlantUML syntax.

Please note that this UML sequence diagram script makes a few assumptions for simplicity, such as the process of a trainer reviewing results and the system checking for duplicate entries. You might need to adjust it according to your specific project details or requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Trainer
participant "Submission Form" as Form
participant "Submission System" as System
participant "Database" as DB

Trainer -> Form : Access submission form
Form -> Trainer : Display form

Trainer -> Form : Submit survey/fedback
Form -> System : Submit entry
System -> DB : Check for duplicates

alt If duplicate exists
    DB -> System : Duplicates found
    System -> Trainer : Error message (duplicates not allowed)
else No duplicate
    DB -> System : No duplicates found
    System -> DB : Save entry
    DB -> System : Confirmation (Entry saved)
    System -> Trainer : Display confirmation message
end

Trainer -> System : Request results
System -> DB : Retrieve results
DB -> System : Results data
System -> Trainer : Display results

This diagram addresses the following sequence:

1. **Access and Submit**: The trainer accesses the survey or feedback submission form, fills it out, and submits it.
2. **Duplicate Check**: The submission system checks the database for duplicate entries based on predefined criteria (e.g., trainer ID, session, timestamp).
3. **Error Handling**: If duplicates are found, an error message is displayed to the trainer. If no duplicates exist, the entry is saved in the database.
4. **Result Viewing**: Finally, the trainer requests to view the results, and the system retrieves and displays this information.

This simple flow ensures that each submission is unique, maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the feedback or survey results. Depending on the complexity of your system, you might have additional components or steps involved, such as authentication checks, more intricate duplicate detection logic, or notification mechanisms for completed submissions.

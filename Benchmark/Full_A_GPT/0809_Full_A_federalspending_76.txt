Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a specific user story like "As a Developer, I want to provide FABS groups that function under the FREC paradigm" requires outlining the key interactions between actors and system components involved in implementing the FREC-based FABS groups functionality. Below, I'll provide you with a PlantUML code snippet that represents such a sequence of interactions.

Please note that to keep the code understandable and focused, certain details about the system architecture or external services might be simplified. The emphasis is on the sequence of steps to achieve the desired functionality regarding the FREC paradigm within the FABS groups.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Developer
boundary "FABS System Interface"
control "FABS Controller"
entity "FABS Service"
database "FABS Database"

Developer -> "FABS System Interface" : Request to add FREC-functional group
"FABS System Interface" -> "FABS Controller" : Initiate FREC group creation
"FABS Controller" -> "FABS Service" : Call create FREC group
"FABS Service" -> "FABS Database" : Validate FREC data
"FABS Database" --> "FABS Service" : Data Validation Results

alt If FREC data is valid
    "FABS Service" -> "FABS Database" : Store FREC group
    "FABS Database" --> "FABS Service" : Confirmation
    "FABS Service" --> "FABS Controller" : Success Response
    "FABS Controller" --> "FABS System Interface" : Display Success Message
    "FABS System Interface" --> Developer : FREC Group Created Successfully
else If FREC data is invalid
    "FABS Service" --> "FABS Controller" : Error Response
    "FABS Controller" --> "FABS System Interface" : Display Error Message
    "FABS System Interface" --> Developer : Failed to Create FREC Group
end

This diagram starts with the Developer requesting to add a new FREC-functional group via the FABS system interface. The system then goes through validations and, based on the outcome (valid or invalid FREC data), either stores the new FREK group or returns an error. This representation keeps the sequence focused on the core elements of the process.

To visualize this diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment, such as an integrated development environment (IDE) with PlantUML support, an online PlantUML editor, or other software tools that can interpret the PlantUML code.

Given the complexity of such a system, a detailed sequence diagram can illustrate the interaction flow for a patron who wishes to view or upload content, including support for multiple formats. Please note that due to the nature of PlantUML and the simplified context here, this diagram will focus on key interactions rather than comprehensive system integration. For older formats like Lotus Works, it is assumed there's a conversion or compatibility layer to handle them appropriately.

Below is a PlantUML source to generate the sequence diagram for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Patron
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "Digital Repository" as Repo
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Format Compatibility Layer" as FCL

== View Content ==
Patron -> Web: Search for content
Web -> Repo: Query content
Repo -> Web: Return search results
Web -> Patron: Display content links

Patron -> Web: Select content to view
Web -> CMS: Request content item
CMS -> Repo: Retrieve content metadata
Repo -> CMS: Provide metadata and location
CMS -> FCL: Request format check/conversion
FCL -> CMS: Provide content in viewable format
CMS -> Web: Deliver content
Web -> Patron: Display content

== Upload Content ==
Patron -> Web: Access upload interface
Web -> Patron: Provide upload form

Patron -> Web: Submit content (incl. Lotus Works files)
Web -> CMS: Send content data
CMS -> FCL: Check/Convert format to compatible type
FCL -> CMS: Return converted content
CMS -> Repo: Store converted content
Repo -> CMS: Confirm storage
CMS -> Web: Confirm upload to user
Web -> Patron: Display success message

This PlantUML diagram outlines the process steps for both viewing and uploading content, including handling of older formats through a Format Compatibility Layer (FCL), which is crucial for supporting files such as Lotus Works. The system's modular approach, with components like the Web Interface, Content Management System (CMS), and the Digital Repository itself, facilitates flexibility and scalability. The FCL acts as an intermediary to ensure the digital repository system remains future-proof and inclusive of various content formats.

Remember, this is a simplified view focusing on core interactions related to the user story. In a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as authentication, authorization, error handling, and user feedback loops would be essential parts of the diagram.

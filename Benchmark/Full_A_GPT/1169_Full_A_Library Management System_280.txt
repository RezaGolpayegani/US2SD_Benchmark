To visualize the sequence of operations involved when a library system member wants to search for a book by publication date, we'll create a PlantUML sequence diagram. This diagram will detail the interaction between the system components starting from the user (Member) initiating a search to the system displaying the search results.

Here's a detailed PlantUML code snippet to represent this user story:

```
@startuml
actor Member
participant "UI: Library Interface" as UI
participant "Controller" as Controller
participant "BookService" as BookService
participant "BookRepository" as BookRepository
database "LibraryDB" as LibraryDB

Member -> UI: Enter publication date search criteria
UI -> Controller: Request to search books by publication date
Controller -> BookService: SearchBooksByDate(publicationDate)
BookSanitize -> BookService: Verify and sanitize date input
activate BookService
BookService -> BookRepository: FindBooksByPublicationDate(publicationDate)
activate BookRepository
BookRepository -> LibraryDB: Query books with specific publication date
activate LibraryDB
LibraryDB --> BookRepository: Return book results
deactivate LibraryDB
BookRepository --> BookService: Book data
deactivate BookRepository
BookService -> BookService: Process results (if required)
BookService --> Controller: Return search results
deactivate BookService
Controller --> UI: Display books matching the publication date
UI --> Member: Show search results

```

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Member initiates the search**: The library system member (user) starts the sequence by searching for books based on a specific publication date using the library's user interface (UI).

2. **UI to Controller**: The UI forwards the search request, including the publication date criteria, to the system's controlling entity for further processing.

3. **Controller handling**: The controller receives the request and calls the `BookService` layer responsible for handling book-related operations, passing along the publication date parameter.

4. **BookService processes the request**: Upon receiving the publication date, the `BookService` initiates a procedure to locate books matching the provided date. It calls the `BookRepository` layer, where the actual querying of the database occurs.

5. **BookRepository querying the LibraryDB**: The `BookRepository` interacts with the `LibraryDB` to execute a database query that retrieves books published on the specified date.

6. **Results are returned back to the Member**: The search results then propagate back through the layers (`LibraryDB` to `BookRepository` to `BookService`, then to the `Controller`, and finally to the UI), where they are presented to the member.

7. **Member views the results**: The sequence concludes with the user interface displaying the list of books that match the publication date search criteria to the member.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction into discrete steps, highlighting how the various components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) work together to fulfill a member's request to search for books by publication date.

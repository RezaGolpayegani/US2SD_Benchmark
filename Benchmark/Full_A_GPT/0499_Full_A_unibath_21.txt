Certainly! Generating a sequence diagram for managing multiple versions of the same dataset in PlantUML format involves detailing the interactions between the depositor and various components of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, including user interfaces, data management services, and the repository itself. Below is a simplified sequence diagram representing this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Data Management Service" as DMS
participant "Version Control" as VC
participant "Repository" as Repo

Depositor -> UI: Access data management page
UI -> DMS: Request to manage dataset versions
activate DMS

DMS -> VC: Check existing versions
activate VC
VC -> Repo: Fetch version history
activate Repo
Repo --> VC: Version history
deactivate Repo

VC --> DMS: Display versions
DMS --> UI: Show version management options

Depositor -> UI: Initiate new version upload
UI -> DMS: Prepare for new version
DMS -> VC: Initialize new version
VC -> Repo: Store new dataset version
activate Repo
Repo --> VC: Version stored
deactivate Repo

VC --> DMS: Update version history
DMS -> VC: Generate new DOI
VC --> DMS: DOI generated

DMS --> UI: Confirm version and DOI
UI --> Depositor: Display confirmation & DOI

alt Applying embargo or license
    Depositor -> UI: Apply embargo/license to version
    UI -> DMS: Update version settings
    DMS -> Repo: Apply settings to version
    Repo --> DMS: Settings applied
    DMS --> UI: Confirm application
    UI --> Depositor: Display confirmation
end

This diagram outlines a sequence where:

1. The depositor accesses the data management page to manage dataset versions.
2. The Data Management Service (DMS) checks for existing versions using the Version Control system, which fetches version history from the Repository.
3. The depositor initiates a new version upload, and the DMS prepares for this by storing the new dataset version with the help of Version Control and the Repository.
4. The new version's DOI is generated, and the depositor is informed about the successful upload and the new version's DOI.
5. An optional step includes applying an embargo or license to the new version, which is managed by updating the version settings in the repository.

Please note, this is a simplified representation to fit the user story's requirements and could be extended with more detailed interactions, error handling, and other system components as needed for a complete implementation.

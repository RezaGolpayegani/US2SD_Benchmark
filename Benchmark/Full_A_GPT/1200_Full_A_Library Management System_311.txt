Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to update my reservation so that I can change the date of the reservation" involves various actors and components such as the User (Member), Frontend System (User Interface), Backend System (Server), Reservation Management Subsystem, and Database. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that describes the interaction between these components.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Member as M
participant "User Interface\n(Frontend System)" as UI
participant "Server\n(Backend System)" as B
participant "Reservation\nManagement Subsystem" as RMS
database "Database" as DB

== Update Reservation Process ==

M -> UI : Selects reservation to update
UI -> B : Request reservation details
B -> RMS : Fetch reservation data
RMS -> DB : Query reservation details
DB -> RMS : Return reservation details
RMS -> B : Reservation data
B -> UI : Display reservation details
M -> UI : Inputs new reservation date
UI -> B : Submit update request with new date
B -> RMS : Process update request
RMS -> DB : Update reservation date
DB -> RMS : Confirmation of update
RMS -> B : Update successful
B -> UI : Show success message
UI -> M : Display update confirmation

To use this PlantUML code, you need to have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor. Here's a brief explanation of the sequence:

1. **Member Selects Reservation to Update:** The member initiates the process by selecting the reservation they wish to update.
2. **Request and Display Reservation Details:** The system fetches and displays the details of the selected reservation.
3. **Member Inputs New Reservation Date:** The member chooses a new date for their reservation.
4. **Submit Update Request:** The updated reservation date is submitted to the server.
5. **Process Update Request:** The server processes the update through the Reservation Management Subsystem.
6. **Update Reservation Date in Database:** The new reservation date is updated in the database.
7. **Confirmation:** The system confirms the successful update of the reservation date to the member.

This sequence diagram abstracts complexities and focuses on the key interactions for updating a reservation date.

Certainly! Here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a member, I want to view book genres."

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Member
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "CLMS Database" as DB
participant "Genres Controller" as GenresCtrl

== User Views Book Genres ==

Member -> Web : Request to view genres
Web -> GenresCtrl : Fetch genres list
activate GenresCtrl

GenresCtrl -> DB : Query available genres
activate DB
DB --> GenresCtrl : Return genres list
deactivate DB

GenresCtrl --> Web : Provide genres list
deactivate GenresCtrl

Web --> Member : Display genres

@enduml
```

Here's a breakdown of the diagram process:

1. **Member (User) initiates a request:** This is the starting point where the library member wants to view the available book genres.

2. **Web Interface receives the request:** The member interacts with the user interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (often a web application), which in turn processes the request to fetch the genres list.

3. **Request passed to Genres Controller:** The web interface communicates with the backend server, specifically targeting the controller responsible for handling genres (Genres Controller).

4. **Genres Controller queries the CLMS Database:** The Genres Controller sends a query to the system's database to retrieve the list of available book genres.

5. **Database responds with the genres list:** The database processes the query and returns the list of genres to the Genres Controller.

6. **Genres list provided to the Web Interface:** The controller processes the data (if necessary) and sends it back to the web interface.

7. **Member views the genres:** Finally, the web interface displays the list of genres to the member.

This sequence diagram focuses on the back-end processes involved when a library member wants to view the available book genres. Each interaction is sequenced to show how the system components communicate to fulfill the user's request.

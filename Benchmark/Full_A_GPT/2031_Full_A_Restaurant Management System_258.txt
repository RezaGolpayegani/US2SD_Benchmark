Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a restaurant manager, I want to see the cost of ingredients" involves representing the sequence of interactions between objects or components in the Restaurant Management and Operations System to fulfill the manager's request. To render this sequence in PlantUML format, we focus on key components such as the Manager Interface, Backend Server, and Database, illustrating the flow from the manager's inquiry to the delivery of ingredient cost data.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager Interface" as manager
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Database" as db

manager -> backend: Request ingredient costs
activate backend
backend -> db: Query ingredient costs
activate db
db --> backend: Ingredient cost data
deactivate db
backend --> manager: Display ingredient costs
deactivate backend

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. **Initiation**: The sequence begins when the restaurant manager requests the cost of ingredients through the Manager Interface.
2. **Request Handling**: The Backend Server receives the request to fetch ingredient cost data.
3. **Database Query**: The Backend Server queries the Database for the cost information of ingredients.
4. **Data Retrieval**: The Database returns the ingredient cost data to the Backend Server.
5. **Data Presentation**: Finally, the Backend Server sends the ingredient cost data to the Manager Interface, where it is displayed to the restaurant manager.

For a complete and accurate rendering, ensure PlantUML is properly installed in your environment or use an online PlantUML editor to visualize the sequence diagram. This conceptual diagram is a simplified representation meant to convey the basic flow of operations for the given user story. Real-world application might involve more steps and interactions, such as handling authentication and authorization, error processing, and data formatting for the frontend.

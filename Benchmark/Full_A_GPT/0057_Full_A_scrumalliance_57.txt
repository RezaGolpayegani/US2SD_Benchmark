Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for the described User Story - "As the site editor, I want to have pretty detailed control over the formatting of the article, so that articles are visually appealing" - involves outlining the interactions between the editor, the content management system (CMS), and other system components related to article creation and formatting within the Scrum Alliance Community Platform.

Given that the request is for a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML syntax, the following is an example that captures the essence of this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Editor as editor
participant "Content Management\nSystem (CMS)" as cms
participant "Article Formatting\nTools" as tools
participant "Database" as db

== Article Creation ==
editor -> cms : Access CMS
cms -> tools : Enable Formatting Tools
tools -> cms : Formatting Features Loaded

== Article Formatting ==
editor -> cms : Choose to Create/Edit Article
cms -> tools : Display Formatting Options
editor -> tools : Select Formatting
tools -> editor : Preview Changes
editor -> tools : Confirm Formatting

== Save Article ==
editor -> cms : Save Article with Formatting
cms -> db : Update Article Data
db -> cms : Confirm Save
cms -> editor : Display Success Message

```

Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Article Creation**: The interaction begins with the Site Editor accessing the CMS to create or edit an article.
2. **Article Formatting**:
   - The CMS enables the Article Formatting Tools, providing the editor with various formatting options.
   - The editor selects the desired formatting options (such as font styles, sizes, headers, and images) to make the article visually appealing. 
   - The editor previews these changes, adjusts as necessary, and confirms the formatting.
3. **Save Article**: Once satisfied with the formatting, the editor saves the article. The CMS updates this information in the database, which then confirms the save operation back to the CMS. Finally, the CMS displays a success message to the editor.

This sequence diagram focuses on the backend logic and interactions that occur when a site editor wants to control the formatting of articles. It simplifies the front-end user interface elements, focusing instead on the sequence of system interactions that support the user story's goal.

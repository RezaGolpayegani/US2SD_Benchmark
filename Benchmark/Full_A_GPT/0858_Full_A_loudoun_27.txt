Given the complexity of generating detailed sequence diagrams with specific syntax, I'll outline a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that translates the user story you provided into a visualization. This diagram outlines the process flow a staff member follows to develop, publish, and distribute a staff report according to business rules within the County Services & Property Information Portal system.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant UserInterface as "Staff Member\n(User Interface)"
database DataStorage as "Portal\nData Storage"
entity ReportModule as "Report\nDevelopment Module"
entity BusinessRulesEngine as "Business Rules\nEngine"
entity DistributionModule as "Distribution\nModule"

UserInterface -> ReportModule : Selects "Create New Report"
activate ReportModule
ReportModule --> UserInterface : Display Report Template Editor

UserInterface -> ReportModule : Enters Report Details\nand Saves Draft
ReportModule -> DataStorage : Store Draft Report
activate DataStorage
DataStorage --> ReportModule : Confirmation
deactivate DataStorage
ReportModule --> UserInterface : Draft Saved Successfully

UserInterface -> ReportModule : Submits Report for Review
ReportModule -> BusinessRulesEngine : Validate\nReport Details
activate BusinessRulesEngine
BusinessRulesEngine --> ReportModule : Validation Success
deactivate BusinessRulesEngine

ReportModule -> DataStorage : Save Final Report
activate DataStorage
DataStorage --> ReportModule : Confirmation
deactivate DataStorage
ReportModule --> UserInterface : Report Submitted Successfully

UserInterface -> DistributionModule : Initiate Report Distribution
activate DistributionModule
DistributionModule -> BusinessRulesEngine : Apply Distribution Rules
activate BusinessRulesEngine
BusinessRulesEngine -> DataStorage : Fetch Distribution List
activate DataStorage
DataStorage --> BusinessRulesEngine : Distribution List
deactivate DataStorage
BusinessRulesEngine --> DistributionModule : Processed List with Rules Applied
deactivate BusinessRulesEngine

DistributionModule -> DataStorage : Log Distribution Activity
activate DataStorage
DataStorage --> DistributionModule : Log Confirmation
deactivate DataStorage

DistributionModule --> UserInterface : Report Distribution Initiated Successfully
deactivate Distribution());

deactivate ReportModule

### Explanation

1. **Start**: The staff member (user) interacts with the User Interface to select the option to create a new report, initiating the sequence of actions.
2. **Drafting**: Utilizing the Report Development Module, the staff member inputs the required information into a provided report template and saves it as a draft.
3. **Validation**: Prior to final submission, the report is validated against a set of business rules to ensure compliance with county policies and procedures.
4. **Submission**: Once validated, the report is saved as a final document within the system's data storage.
5. **Distribution**: The staff member then initiates the report distribution process, during which the Distribution Module applies further business rules to determine the appropriate distribution channels and recipients.
6. **Logging and Confirmation**: The distribution activity, including the recipients and method of distribution, is logged within the system. A confirmation of the successful distribution initiation is provided back to the staff member.

This simplified PlantUML sequence diagram sketches out the basic interactions between the user, the portal's report development and distribution modules, business rules engine, and the data storage system to develop, validate, and distribute a staff report according to defined business rules. To fully implement this diagram, consider refining the logic and adding error handling or alternative flows based on the specific business rules you need to account for.

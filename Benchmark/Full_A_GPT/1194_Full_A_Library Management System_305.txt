To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a member wants to see suggested books according to keywords to make their research more effective, we can use PlantUML syntax to outline the interactions among different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This sequence will include actions like member inputting keywords, system searching the database, and then presenting suggested books to the member.

Given the complexity of the system and the specific user story, our sequence diagram will focus on the interaction between the user (Member), the Web Interface, the Controller (part of the backend logic that handles requests), the Recommendation Engine, and the Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Controller" as Controller
participant "Recommendation Engine" as RE
participant "Database" as DB

Member -> Web : Enter keywords for book search
Web -> Controller : Request book suggestions (keywords)
Controller -> RE : Query with keywords
RE -> DB : Search for books based on keywords
DB -> RE : Return search results
RE -> Controller : Suggest books based on algorithm + search results
Controller -> Web : Display suggested books
Web -> Member : Show book suggestions

This diagram starts with the `Member` entering keywords into a search field on the `Web Interface`. The web interface then communicates with the `Controller`, sending it the request for book suggestions based on the provided keywords. The `Controller` forwards this request to the `Recommendation Engine` (RE), which in turn queries the `Database` for books matching those keywords. Once the `Database` returns the search results to the RE, it applies its algorithm to generate suggestions based on not only the direct search results but also considering factors like book popularity, related genres, and user preferences if available. The RE sends these suggestions back to the Controller, which then passes the data to the Web Interface to display the suggested books to the member.

Remember, this sequence diagram is a high-level overview; the actual implementation might involve more detailed interactions, especially within the Recommendation Engine. This engine's sophistication—how it considers keywords, member history, and other factors—can significantly impact the system's overall behavior and performance.

Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to see the library plan so that I can easily find the resources" involves illustrating the interaction between the library member, the library's system interfaces, and backend services. Note that the specific implementations can vary based on the system's architecture, but the following PlantUML code provides a detailed depiction of this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "CLMS Controller" as Controller
database "Library Database" as DB

LibraryMember -> Web : Request library plan
Web -> Controller : Get library plan
activate Controller

Controller -> DB : Fetch plan details
activate DB
DB --> Controller : Plan details
deactivate DB

Controller --> Web : Library plan data
deactivate Controller

Web --> LibraryIdMBer : Display library plan
@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the library member requesting to see the library plan. Here's a breakdown of how the sequence unfolds:

1. **Library Member Initiates Request:** The library member accesses the library's web interface and requests to view the library plan. This action could be through clicking a link or navigating to a specific section of the library's digital platform.

2. **Request Forwarded to Controller:** The request is then forwarded by the web interface to the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) controller, which acts as the intermediary between the front-end interface and the back-end functionalities.

3. **Controller Fetches Plan Details:** The CLMS controller processes this request and communicates with the library database to fetch the details of the library plan. This could involve retrieving a digital map, shelf arrangement plans, or other resources that help users locate physical resources within the library.

4. **Database Returns Plan Details:** The library database processes the query and returns the details of the library plan back to the controller. 

5. **Controller Sends Data to Web Interface:** Once the CLMS controller receives the detailed library plan from the database, it forwards these details to the web interface.

6. **Library Member Views Library Plan:** Lastly, the web interface processes the library plan data and displays it to the library member in a readable and interactive format. This could involve visual maps, directories, or other digital representations that assist the member in finding physical resources within the library.

By following this sequence, the library member can effectively and efficiently find resources within the library, enhancing their overall experience. This implementation assumes a modern web application framework, optimized database interactions, and user-friendly interface designs, all integral to the Comprehensive Library Management System's architecture and functionality.

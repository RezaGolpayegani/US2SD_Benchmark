Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the stated user story involves illustrating the interactions between different entities to accomplish the task of converting country codes to country names in a dataset. Here's a representation in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as R
participant "DPIE API" as API
participant "Country Code Service" as CCS
participant "Data Package Processor" as DPP
participant "Data Storage" as DS

R -> API: Request to add country names
API -> CCS: Query for country names using codes
CCS -> API: Return country names
API -> DPP: Map country codes with names
DPP -> DS: Update dataset with country names
DS -> DPP: Confirm update
DPP -> API: Update successful
API -> R: Dataset updated with country names

```

The sequence diagram begins with the Researcher (or Government Publisher) making a request to add country names to a dataset that currently contains only country codes. This request is received by the DPIE API, which then queries a Country Code Service with the country codes present in the dataset. The Country Code Service returns the corresponding country names to the DPIE API.

Subsequently, the DPIE API forwards this mapping of country codes to names to the Data Package Processor, which then updates the dataset stored in Data Storage with the newly mapped country names. The Data Storage confirms the update back to the Data Package Processor, which in turn informs the DPIE API that the update was successful. Finally, the DPIE API notifies the Researcher that the dataset has been successfully updated with country names, thus making the dataset more readable.

This sequence diagram showcases a straightforward process involving several components working together to enhance the readability of the dataset. It's a simplified view focused on achieving the specified user story goal within the framework of the DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a customer, I want to see the expiry dates" requires mapping out the interactions between the customer, the system's front-end, and the back-end services, including database queries and the response flow. This scenario implies that customers are interested in knowing the expiry dates of the ingredients or menu items, a feature that adds transparency and builds trust.

Given the complexity and the detail required, here's a high-level representation in PlantUML format. This sequence assumes the customer has already navigated to a specific menu item where they can inquire about expiry dates, necessitating interactions with the front-end interface, the application's server-side logic, and finally, the database where ingredient data, including expiry dates, are stored.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Customer as C
participant Frontend as F
participant BackendServer as B
participant Database as D

C -> F: Selects menu item
activate F

F -> B: Request ingredient details (including expiry dates) for selected item
activate B

B -> D: Query ingredient and expiry date details
activate D

D --> B: Return ingredient and expiry date data
deactivate D

B --> F: Send data to front-end
deactivate B

F --> C: Display ingredient information and expiry dates
deactivate F

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the flow from the customer's action to view specifics about a menu item, through the system, and back to the customer with the desired information. Keep in mind, the granularity and complexity of such interactions can vary based on system architecture and the exact specifications of the implemented features.

In a real-world implementation, consider aspects such as error handling (e.g., what happens if the data is unavailable), user interface design (how the information is presented to the customer), and security considerations (ensuring that the data retrieval process protects sensitive information). Additionally, depending on the project requirements, it might also be necessary to interact with third-party APIs or services, especially if the expiry date information is augmented or verified by external sources.

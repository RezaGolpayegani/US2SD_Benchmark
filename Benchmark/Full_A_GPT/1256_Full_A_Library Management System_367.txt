Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of a student wanting to find shelf information for books in a Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) involves depicting the interactions between the system's components in response to the user's action. Below is a PlantUML representation of how this process could be visualized.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student
participant "Search Interface" as search
participant "Library Database" as db
participant "Books Controller" as controller
participant "Shelf Information System" as shelfInfo


== Finding Shelf Information for a Book ==
Student -> search : searches for a book
search -> controller : fetchBookDetails(searchQuery)
controller -> db : queryBookDetails(searchQuery)
db -> controller : return bookDetails
controller -> shelfInfo : getShelfInfo(bookID)
shelfInfo -> controller : return shelfInfoDetails
controller -> search : displayBookAndShelfInfo(bookDetails, shelfInfoDetails)
search -> Student : showBookShelfInfo(bookDetails, shelfInfoDetails)

### Explanation:

1. **Student**: This is the individual (student) initiating the action of searching for the shelf information of a particular book.
   
2. **Search Interface**: This interface within the CLMS allows the student to search for books based on different criteria such as title, author, or subject category.
   
3. **Library Database**: Houses all the information about books, including titles, authors, categories, and crucially, their shelf locations.
   
4. **Books Controller**: Acts as an intermediary that processes requests from the search interface and communicates with the database and other systems to fetch the desired information.
   
5. **Shelf Information System**: This component stores and manages detailed shelf information for each book, allowing for efficient retrieval of where a book can be found in the library.

### Sequence of Events:

1. The student starts the process by entering a search query (e.g., a book's title, author, or category) into the search interface.
   
2. The search interface forwards this query to the books controller to fetch the book's details, including its shelf information.
   
3. The books controller queries the library database to get the details of the requested book based on the search query provided by the student.
   
4. Once the book details are retrieved, the books controller requests the shelf information for that book from the shelf information system using the book's ID.
   
5. The shelf information system retrieves and returns the specific shelf location details of the book to the books controller.
   
6. Having gathered both the book details and the shelf information, the books controller returns this combined information to the search interface.
   
7. The search interface then displays the book details along with the shelf location to the student, completing the sequence.

This sequence diagram demonstrates the backend process in the CLMS that allows students to effectively find where books are located in the library, ensuring a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

Below is a simple representation of a sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate the user story: "As a user, I want to have the details of the workflow execution to be recorded in a Neurohub log book while executing a workflow." This sequence diagram assumes a basic interaction model involving the User, the Neurohub System (which includes the Workflow Execution Engine and the Logbook Module), and the Logbook where records are stored.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant User
participant "Workflow Execution Engine" as Engine
participant "Logbook Module" as Logbook
database "Logbook Database" as DB

User -> Engine: Initiate workflow execution
activate Engine

Engine -> Logbook: Start workflow execution log
activate Logbook

Logbook -> DB: Record start of execution
activate DB
DB --> Logbook: Confirmation
deactivate DB

Engine -> Engine: Execute workflow steps
... // Workflow Execution Steps

Engine --> User: Workflow execution result
deactivate Engine

Engine -> Logbook: End workflow execution log
activate Logbook

Logbook -> DB: Record end of execution details
activate DB
DB --> Logbook: Confirmation
deactivate DB

Logbook --> Engine: Log update confirmation
deactivate Logbook

This diagram outlines a simplified process:
- The **User** initiates the execution of a workflow via the Neurohub platform.
- The **Workflow Execution Engine** starts the process and notifies the **Logbook Module** to record the start of the execution.
- The **Logbook Module** writes this event into the **Logbook Database** and, after executing the workflow steps, it records the end of the execution details, including any outcomes or errors.
- Throughout the process, the user is kept informed of the execution progress and results.

This model is abstract and can be expanded with more detailed interactions, error handling routines, and specific logging details based on the actual requirements of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project.

To visualize the sequence of interactions for the user story "As a waiter, I want to see the track of the order" in the context of a Restaurant Management and Operations System using PlantUML, follow this detailed sequence diagram outline. This example assumes key system components and typical interactions based on the project description provided.

Please note, since PlantUML code cannot be executed or rendered here, the following is a textual representation of what the PlantUML code would look like:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter as waiter
participant "Order Tracking System" as trackingSystem
participant "Database" as db

waiter -> trackingSystem: Request order status
activate waiter
activate trackingSystem

trackingSystem -> db: Query order by ID
activate db

db -> trackingSystem: Return order details
deactivate db

trackingSystem -> waiter: Show order status (Preparing/Cooking/Ready)
deactivate trackingMediaStorage

waiter -> trackingSystem: Request updates \n(if status == Preparing or Cooking)
activate trackingSystem

trackingSystem -> trackingSystem: Subscribe to updates
deactivate trackingSystem

loop Until Order Ready
    trackingSystem-> waiter: Send real-time updates
    activate waiter
    deactivate waiter
end

trackingSystem -> waiter: Notify when order is ready
activate trackingSystem

waiter -> waiter: Collect order from kitchen

deactivate trackingSystem
@enduml
```

Explanation of steps:
1. **Waiter Requests Order Status**: The waiter initiates a request to the Order Tracking System to view the current status of an order.
2. **Order Tracking System Queries Database**: The Order Tracking System queries the back-end database for the specific order's details by ID.
3. **Database Returns Order Details**: The database returns the requested order details, including its current status, back to the Order Tracking System.
4. **Show Order Status to Waiter**: The tracking system then displays the current status of the order (e.g., Preparing, Cooking, Ready) to the waiter.
5. **Request Updates on Order Status**: If the order is not ready, the waiter can request to be kept updated on the status changes.
6. **Subscription to Updates**: The Order Tracking System subscribes the waiter to real-time updates on the order's status.
7. **Loop of Real-time Updates**: The Order Tracking System sends real-time updates to the waiter as the order status changes within the kitchen until the order is marked as ready.
8. **Notification of Order Readiness**: Once the order is ready for serving, the Order Tracking System notifies the waiter.
9. **Waiter Collects the Order**: Finally, the waiter is informed and proceeds to collect the order from the kitchen for service to the customer.

This sequence diagram aims to capture the flow of interactions involved in tracking an order's status from a waiter's perspective within a restaurant management system.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a trainer, I want to copy one of my courses or events, so that I can create a new one" involves visualizing the interaction between different system components/entities from when a trainer initiates the action to copy a course or event until the process is completed. This sequence diagram describes a simplified view of the interactions for copying a course/event. 

Please note that to fully implement such a feature, additional steps and actors may be involved depending on the complexity of the system's architecture, business rules, and requirements not detailed in the summary project description.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Trainer
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Course/Event Management Module" as CEM
database "Database" as DB

Trainer -> UI : Selects course/event to copy
UI -> CEM : Request to copy course/event details
CEM -> DB : Retrieve selected course/event details
DB -> CEM : Course/event details
CEM -> DB : Save new course/event with copied details
DB -> CEM : Confirm course/event creation
CEM -> UI : Display success message
UI -> Trainer : Show confirmation and link to edit new course/event

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

- **Trainer**: Initiates the process by choosing a specific course or event they wish to copy for creating a new one.
- **UI Interface**: Acts as the interface through which the trainer interacts with the system.
- **Course/Event Management Module (CEM)**: Handles the logic for managing courses and events, including copying and creating them.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores all data related to courses and events, including details that will be copied to create a new entry.

**Steps:**

1. The trainer selects the course or event they wish to copy through the UI Interface.
2. The UI Interface sends a request to the Course/Event Management Module to copy the selected course/event.
3. The Course/Event Management Module requests the details of the selected course/event from the Database.
4. The Database returns the requested details to the Course/Event Management Module.
5. The Course/Event Management Module then sends a request to the Database to save a new course/event using the copied details.
6. After successfully creating the new course/event, the Database confirms the course/event creation to the Course/Event Management Module.
7. The Course/Event Management Module communicates the success of the action to the UI Interface, which in turn, displays a success message to the trainer.
8. The UI Interface shows the trainer a confirmation and provides a link to edit the newly created course/event.

This sequence ensures that existing course or event details can be copied and used as a basis for creating new courses/events, simplifying the process for trainers and maintaining consistent course/event information across the platform.

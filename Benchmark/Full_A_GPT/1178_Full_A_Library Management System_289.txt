Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a member, I want to see the due date" involves illustrating the interactions between a library member and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) as they navigate through the process of checking the due date of a borrowed book. Letâ€™s depict a typical flow where the library member logs into the system, searches for the borrowed book, and retrieves its due date.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "User Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Book Management System" as Books
participant "Database" as DB

Member -> Auth: Enter credentials
Auth -> Member: Authentication successful

Member -> Dashboard: Access Dashboard
Dashboard -> Member: Display Dashboard

Member -> Books: Select "View My Borrowed Books"
Books -> DB: Query borrowed books and due dates for member
DB -> Books: Return borrowed books data
Books -> Member: Display borrowed books and due dates

Member -> Books: Select a book to see detailed due date
Books -> DB: Query detailed due date for selected book
DB -> Books: Return detailed due date
Books -> Member: Display due date information

This sequence diagram starts with the Member interacting with the Authentication System to log in to the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Upon successful authentication, the Member accesses the User Dashboard. From there, the Member navigates to the Book Management System interface to view the "My Borrowed Books" section. The Book Management System then interacts with the Database to fetch and return the list of borrowed books along with their due dates. If the Member selects a specific book to see its detailed due date, the Book Management System makes another query to the Database to retrieve this information, which is then displayed to the Member.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the operations involved in checking a book's due date within the CLMS. Adjustments and expansions can be made to incorporate additional features or specific system behaviors as required by the project specifications.

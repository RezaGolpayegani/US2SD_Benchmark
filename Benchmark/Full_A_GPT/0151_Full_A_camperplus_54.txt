Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating how the system components interact when a camp worker wants to view the campers they are in charge of, along with the corresponding locations. This process begins with the camp worker requesting the information and ends with the system displaying the relevant data.

Below is a PlantUML code example for this scenario.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CampWorker as worker
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Worker Module" as workerModule
participant "Database" as db

worker -> web : Request assigned camper list
web -> workerModule : Get assigned camper list
workerModule -> db : Query assigned campers and locations
db --> workerModule : Return camper data
workerModule --> web : Display assigned campers and locations
web --> worker : Show camper list and locations

```

**Explanation of the Sequence:**

1. **Camp Worker's Request:** The sequence starts with the camp worker (`CampWorker`) making a request to view the list of campers they are responsible for, along with the locations where these campers are supposed to be. This request is made through the platform's web interface (`Web Interface`).

2. **Processing the Request:** The web interface forwards this request to the Worker Module (`Worker Module`), a backend component designed to handle queries related to camp workers and their assigned campers.

3. **Database Query:** The Worker Module then sends a query to the database (`Database`) to retrieve the requested information. This database contains all records related to campers, including which camp workers are assigned to them and the locations of their activities.

4. **Returning the Data:** The database processes the query and returns the relevant data about the assigned campers and their locations back to the Worker Module.

5. **Displaying the Information:** The Worker Module processes the returned data and sends it back to the web interface, which then presents the information to the camp worker. The worker can now see a list of campers assigned to them along with where those campers are supposed to be.

6. **Camp Worker Views Information:** Finally, the camp worker reviews the list of assigned campers and their locations, enabling them to ensure they are adequately performing their duties.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of interactions within the system to fulfill the user story of a camp worker wanting to know which campers they are in charge of, and where. Each step is crucial for ensuring the camp worker has the necessary information to perform their job effectively.

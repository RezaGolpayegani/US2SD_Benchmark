To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story where an administrator wants to create user roles to group users, follow the outlined syntax. This sequence diagram will illustrate the flow starting from the administrator deciding to create new roles, interacting with the system's user interface, the system processing the request, to the database updating with the new roles.

Make sure you have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor to visualize the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator
participant "User Management System" as UMS
database "User Roles Database" as DB

== Create User Roles ==

Administrator -> UMS : Access Role Management

alt Role Creation Form Displayed
    UMS --> Administrator : Display Role Creation Form
else Error Loading Form
    UMS --> Administrator : Display Error Message
end

Administrator -> UMS : Submit New Role Details
activate UMS

alt Valid Role Details
    UMS -> DB : Create New Role in Database
    activate DB
    alt Role Successfully Created
        DB --> UMS : Confirm Role Creation
        UMS --> Administrator : Display Success Message
    else Role Creation Failed
        DB --> UMS : Error Message
        UMS --> Administrator : Display Error Message
    end
    deactivate DB
else Invalid Role Details
    UMS --> Administrator : Display Validation Error
end

deactivate UMS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows a simple flow where:

1. The administrator accesses the role management functionality provided by the User Management System (UMS).
2. The UMS attempts to display a role creation form to the administrator.
3. The administrator, after reviewing the form, submits the new role details back to the UMS.
4. The UMS processes these details. If the details are valid, it will then request the User Roles Database (DB) to create a new role.
5. Depending on the outcome (success or failure of role creation), respective messages are displayed back to the administrator.

Please, adjust the diagram according to specific requirements or details of your project's architecture or desired workflow nuances. This basic template can be expanded with more alternatives, user interactions, or system responses to match the complexity of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project's context.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an OlderPerson, I want to use ALFRED to control the TV and radio" using PlantUML, you need to visualize the series of interactions between the user (OlderPerson), ALFRED, and the smart devices (TV and Radio). Here is a simplified approach to this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED\nInterface" as alfred
participant "Smart\nTV" as tv
participant "Smart\nRadio" as radio

== Turn TV On ==
user -> alfred : Says "Turn on the TV"
alfred -> tv : Sends signal to power on
tv -> alfred : Confirms TV is On
alfred -> user : "TV is now on"

== Change TV Channel ==
user -> alfred : Says "Change TV to channel 5"
alfred -> tv : Sends signal to change channel
tv -> alfred : Confirms channel changed
alfred -> user : "TV channel changed to 5"

== Increase TV Volume ==
user -> alfred : Says "Increase TV volume"
alfred -> tv : Sends signal to increase volume
tv -> alfred : Confirms volume increased
alfred -> user : "TV volume increased"

== Turn Radio On ==
user -> alfred : Says "Turn on the Radio"
alfred -> radio : Sends signal to power on
radio -> alfred : Confirms Radio is On
alfred -> user : "Radio is now on"

== Change Radio Station ==
user -> alfred : Says "Change radio to station FM 101.2"
alfred -> radio : Sends signal to change station
radio -> alfred : Confirms station changed
alfred -> user : "Radio station changed to FM 101.2"

== Turn TV Off ==
user -> alfred : Says "Turn off the TV"
alfred -> tv : Sends signal to power off
tv -> alfred : Confirms TV is Off
alfred -> user : "TV is now off"

== Turn Radio Off ==
user -> alfred : Says "Turn off the Radio"
alfred -> radio : Sends signal to power off
radio -> alfred : Confirms Radio is Off
alfred -> user : "Radio is now off"

This sequence diagram outlines a scenario where the OlderPerson interacts with ALFRED using voice commands to control a smart TV and radio. The steps include turning devices on and off, changing TV channels, adjusting the TV volume, and changing radio stations. ALFRED serves as the intermediary, receiving commands from the user, interacting with the devices, and confirming actions back to the user. Please adjust the sequence based on specific project needs or technological implementations.

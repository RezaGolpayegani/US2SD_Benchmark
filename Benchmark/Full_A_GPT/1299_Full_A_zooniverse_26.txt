To visualize the process described in your user story in a sequence diagram format using PlantUML, you need a textual representation of interactions between different system components and stakeholders involved in prefiltering the content based on high-level asset information such as metadata and tags. Below is an example sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax that illustrates these interactions.

```
@startuml
participant Admin
participant "Search & Filter UI" as UI
participant "Content Management Service" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB

Admin -> UI : Enter search criteria\n(metadata/tags)
UI -> CMS : Request content\nbased on criteria
activate CMS
CMS -> DB : Query content information\n(metadata/tags)
DB --> CMS : Return query results
deactivate CMS
CMS --> UI : Display content results
UI --> Admin : Show content matching\nsearch criteria
note right of Admin : Admin reviews\ncontent items
Admin -> CMS : Select content for detailed view/editing
CMS -> DB : Fetch detailed content data
DB --> CMS : Return detailed content
CMS --> Admin : Display detailed content information
note over Admin : Prefiltering process based\non metadata and tags complete.

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Admin initiating a search through the Search & Filter UI using specific criteria related to metadata and tags. The Search & Filter UI communicates with the Content Management Service (CMS) to process this request. CMS, in turn, queries the Database for content that matches the search criteria. The Database returns the query results to CMS, which then passes the information back to the Search & Filter UI. The UI presents the search results to the Admin, who can review the content items. The Admin selects specific content for a detailed view or editing, prompting CMS to fetch detailed content data from the Database. Finally, CMS displays the detailed content information to the Admin.

To use this PlantUML code, you need to have PlantUML installed or access to an online PlantUML editor where you can paste this code to visualize the sequence diagram.

Given the complexity and detailed nature of the request, below is a high-level example of how you might represent a sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format. This example focuses on a scenario where a DB/IR (Database/Information Repository) administrator interacts with the system to manage patron accounts, specifically for viewing and editing subscriptions and resetting passwords. 

For a comprehensive system like the one described for Cornell University, it's important to note that actual implementations may involve more complex interactions, including but not limited to, interactions with external systems, additional security checks, and more detailed steps for each action.

This example is simplified for clarity and instructional purposes:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "DB/IR Administrator" as admin
participant "Admin Interface" as interface
database "Patron Account DB" as patronDB

== View Patron Subscriptions ==
admin -> interface: Access patron accounts section
activate interface
interface -> patronDB: Retrieve account details
activate patronDB
patronDB -> interface: Account details
deactivate patronDB
interface -> admin: Display account subscriptions
deactivate interface

== Edit Patron Subscriptions ==
admin -> interface: Select Edit Subscriptions
activate interface
admin -> interface: Modify subscriptions
interface -> patronDB: Update subscription details
activate patronDB
patronDB -> interface: Confirmation of update
deactivate patronDB
interface -> admin: Display updated subscriptions
deactivate interface

== Reset Patron Password ==
admin -> interface: Select Reset Password
activate interface
admin -> interface: Confirm password reset
interface -> patronDB: Process password reset
activate patronDB
patronDB -> patronDB: Generate temporary password
patronDB -> interface: Temporary password & reset confirmation
deactivate patronDB
interface -> admin: Display confirmation and temporary password
deactivate interface

This sequence diagram describes three main actions:

1. **Viewing Patron Subscriptions**: The DB/IR administrator accesses the patron accounts section, the system retrieves and displays the account details including subscriptions.
2. **Editing Patron Subscriptions**: The administrator chooses to edit subscriptions, makes the changes, and the system updates and confirms the update to the administrator.
3. **Resetting Patron Passwords**: The administrator selects to reset a password, confirms the action, and the system processes this request, generating a temporary password and confirming the action to the administrator.

Please modify and expand this basic structure to fit more detailed requirements or specific infrastructural designs you have in mind.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interaction between different objects (User, Interface, System, Database, etc.) to fulfill the donor representative's request. Below is a basic PlantUML sequence diagram script that models this interaction. It's important to note that actual implementations can vary based on specific system designs and requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DonorRepresentative as DR
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Authorization System" as Auth
participant "File Management" as FM
participant "Database" as DB

DR -> UI : Access Website
UI -> Auth : Request Access
Auth -> DR : Authenticate
DR -> UI : Request Image Descriptive Info
UI -> FM : Query for Images
FM -> DB : Fetch Image Metadata
DB -> FM : Return Metadata
FM -> UI : Display Descriptive Info
UI -> DR : Show Descriptive Information about Images
@enduml
```
To visualize this, you'll need to copy the code into a PlantUML editor or any tool that supports PlantUML diagrams.

**Explanation of the Process:**

1. **DonorRepresentative (DR) -> User Interface (UI):** The donor representative accesses the web interface (website) of the digital archive.

2. **User Interface (UI) -> Authorization System (Auth):** The website requests the donor representative to authenticate, which could involve logging in with credentials.

3. **Authorization System (Auth) -> DonorRepresentative (DR):** The authorization system authenticates the donor representative and grants them access.

4. **DonorRepresentative (DR) -> User Interface (UI):** Once authenticated, the donor representative requests descriptive information about specific images they are interested in.

5. **User Interface (UI) -> File Management (FM):** This request is then forwarded to the File Management system, which is responsible for handling files and metadata.

6. **File Management (FM) -> Database (DB):** The File Management system queries the database to fetch metadata or descriptive information related to the requested images.

7. **Database (DB) -> File Management (FM):** The database returns the image metadata or descriptive information to the File Management system.

8. **File Registration Platform (FM) -> User Interface (UI):** The File Management system sends the descriptive information back to the user interface.

9. **User Interface (UI) -> DonorRepresentative (DR):** Finally, the user interface displays the descriptive information about the images to the donor representative.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the process. Specific details and additional steps (like error handling, logging, etc.) can be added to this diagram based on the exact requirements and system architecture.

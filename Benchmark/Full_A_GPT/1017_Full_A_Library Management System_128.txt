Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a library manager, I want to know which books are borrowed most so that I can bring further copies of the books," involves outlining interactions between the library manager, the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the database, among others. 

Here's how you can represent this scenario using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryManager as LM
participant "CLMS Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "CLMS Database" as DB

LM -> UI : Login into CLMS
UI -> Backend : Validate login
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Fetch manager credentials
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Credentials data
deactivate DB
Backend --> UI : Authentication successful
deactivate Backend
UI --> LM : Display Dashboard
LM -> UI : Selects "Most Borrowed Books" Report
UI -> Backend : Request most borrowed books data
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Query borrowed books stats
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return stats
deactivate DB
Backend --> UI : Display most borrowed books
deactivate Backend
UI --> LM : Shows books and borrowing counts
LM -> UI : Requests further copies for procurement
UI -> Backend : Log procurement request
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Update procurement log
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Confirmation
deactivate DB
Backend --> UI : Confirm update to LM
deactivate Backend
UI --> LM : Display procurement confirmation
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the library manager logging into the CLMS, viewing the "Most Borrowed Books" report, and concluding with the manager requesting further copies of books based on the borrowing statistics provided. The main actors involved include the Library Manager, the CLMS user interface (UI), the backend system, and the database that stores all relevant data.

In the scenario, the steps are:
- The Library Manager logs into the CLMS.
- The System authenticates the manager and shows the dashboard.
- The Library Manager requests to view the "Most Borrowed Books" report.
- The Backend System queries the database for statistics on borrowed books.
- The System displays this information to the Library Manager.
- The Library Manager decides to procure further copies of the most borrowed books and makes a request.
- The Backend System logs this procurement request and updates the manager with a confirmation.

Remember, to render this diagram, you need to have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story ("As a user, I want to create a protocol and assign metadata to any stage.") requires a breakdown of the user's actions, system responses, and interactions with potentially external systems for metadata handling. The described user story implies a need for interaction between a user interface, data management system, and a metadata management system within the Neurohub platform.

Below is a representation of these interactions in PlantUML format. Note that due to the conceptual nature of the project description and lack of specific implementation details, some assumptions about system architecture and process flow are made for illustrative purposes.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
database "Data Management" as data
database "Metadata System" as metadata

user -> web: Navigate to Protocol Creation
web -> user: Display Protocol Creation Form

user -> web: Fill in Protocol Details
user -> web: Submit Protocol

web -> data: Save Protocol Information
data -> web: Confirm Save

web -> user: Show Metadata Assignment Options
user -> web: Submit Metadata Details

web -> metadata: Process Metadata
metadata -> metadata: Validate Metadata Format
metadata -> data: Assign Metadata to Protocol Stage

data -> web: Confirm Metadata Assignment
web -> user: Display Success Message & Protocol Details

```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. The user navigates to the protocol creation section of the web interface.
2. The web interface displays a form for the user to fill in with protocol details.
3. Upon filling in the details, the user submits the protocol form.
4. The web interface communicates with the data management system to save these details.
5. The data management system confirms the save operation to the web interface.
6. The web interface then shows options or a form for the user to assign metadata to a particular stage of the protocol.
7. The user submits metadata details through the web interface.
8. The web interface processes this input and communicates with the metadata system.
9. The metadata system validates the format and contents of the metadata supplied.
10. If valid, the metadata system communicates with the data management system to assign the metadata to the specified protocol stage.
11. The data management system confirms the metadata assignment.
12. Finally, the web interface shows the user a success message along with the details of the protocol, including the newly assigned metadata.

This sequence diagram assumes a simplified workflow where communication is synchronous and sequential, primarily focusing on the interactions required for a user to create a protocol and assign metadata within the Neurohub platform.

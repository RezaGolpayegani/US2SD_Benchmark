Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to give comments on books" involves illustrating the flow of messages between objects in the scenario. In PlantUML, you can represent this process step-by-step, focusing on the interactions involved when a library member adds comments on books in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Here's a basic example of how you might represent this interaction using Plant UML:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "CLMS Database" as DB
participant "Comments Module" as Comments

Member -> Web : Navigate to book details
Web -> DB : Fetch book information
DB --> Web :Return book details
Web --> Member : Display book details

Member -> Web : Select 'Add Comment'
Web -> Comments : Initiate comment posting
Member -> Web : Enter comment
Web -> Comments : Validate comment\n(Check for profanity, length)

alt Validation Success
    Comments -> DB : Save comment
    DB --> Comments : Confirmation
    Comments -> Web : Confirm comment posted
    Web --> Member : Display success message
else Validation Failed
    Comments -> Web : Show validation error
    Web --> Member : Display error message
end

@enduml
```

Explanation:
- **Member to Web Interface:** The member starts the process by navigating to the details page of the book they want to comment on through the system's web interface.
- **Web Interface to CLMS Database:** The web interface requests the book's details from the CLMS database to ensure that the member is interacting with a valid book entry.
- **CLMS Database to Web Interface:** The database returns the necessary book details, which are then displayed to the member.
- **Member Interaction for Adding a Comment:** The member initiates adding a comment by selecting the 'Add Comment' option, entering their comment, and submitting it.
- **Web Interface to Comments Module for Validation:** The comment is passed to a Comments Module that handles validation checks like profanity filtering and length constraints.
- **Comments Module to CLMS Database (Conditional):** If the comment passes validation, it's saved in the database. The database confirms the action to the Comments Module.
- **Success or Failure Feedback:** Depending on whether the validation is successful, the member is either shown a success message for the successfully posted comment or an error message if there's a validation issue.

This sequence diagram focuses on a simplified flow for adding comments on books, relevant in a library management system context. Adjustments might be needed based on specific project requirements or additional features within the CLMS.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a cook, I want to mark unavailable items as available, so that the waiter can inform customers," involves visualizing the interaction between the cook, the system, and ultimately, how this information reaches the waiter. This example below utilizes PlantUML syntax to outline how the cook updates an item's availability status, which the system then communicates to the waiter.

Please note, for visualization, you'll need to translate this code in a PlantUML environment (e.g., PlantUML online editor, Visual Studio Code with PlantUML extension, or any other compatible tool).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook
participant "Management System" as System
participant Database
participant "Waiter's Interface" as WaiterInterface

Cook -> System : Marks item as available
activate Cook
activate System

System -> Database : Update item status to 'Available'
activate Database

Database -> System : Confirm update
deactivate Database

System -> WaiterInterface : Notify about item availability
activate WaiterInterface

WaiterInterface -> WaiterInterface : Display updated item status
WaiterInterface -> Cook : Display confirmation message
deactivate System

Cook -> Cook : Update completed
deactivate Cook
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Cook -> System**: The cook initiates the process by selecting the item they wish to mark as available within the restaurant management system.

2. **System -> Database**: The system processes the cook's request and updates the corresponding item status in the database to 'Available.'

3. **Database -> System**: The database sends a confirmation of the update back to the system.

4. **System -> WaiterInterface**: The system then notifies the waiter's interface (could be a POS system, a mobile app, or a web app accessible by waitstaff) that the item is now available.

5. **WaiterInterface -> Cook**: Optionally, the system can confirm to the cook that the item's status has been updated and waitstaff have been notified. This step ensures the cook knows their action was successful and communicated.

6. **WaiterInterface**: The waiter's interface receives the notification and automatically updates the display to show the item as available. This enables waiters to inform or recommend the now-available items to customers effectively.

This PlantUML sequence diagram represents a simplified interaction flow for the user story. It assumes direct communication between the cook and the system and between the system and the waiter's interface without manual intervention. Depending on the specific system design, additional steps or components (like notifications to a mobile app) might be integrated into the process.

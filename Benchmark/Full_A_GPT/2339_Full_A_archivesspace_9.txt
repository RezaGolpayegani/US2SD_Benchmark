To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the User Story "As an Archivist, I want to associate a standard identifier string with a Subject heading," you'll need to outline the process steps and interactions between various components of the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS) and the archivist. Below is an example:

Note: This sequence diagram assumes that prior to the association of a standard identifier with a Subject heading, the Archivist is authenticated and authorized to perform this task.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Authentication\nService" as auth
participant "Subject Heading\nManagement Module" as subjectModule
participant "Database" as db

== Authentication Phase ==
archivist -> ui : Access System
ui -> auth : Request Authentication
auth -> archivist : Authenticate
archivist -> auth : Provide Credentials
auth -> ui : Authentication Success

== Association Phase ==
archivist -> ui : Select Subject Heading
ui -> subjectModule : Request Subject Heading Details
subjectModule -> db : Retrieve Heading Details
db -> subjectModule : Return Details
subjectModule -> ui : Display Heading Details to Archivist
archivist -> ui : Input Standard Identifier
ui -> subjectModule : Associate Identifier with Heading
subjectModule -> db : Update Heading with Identifier
db -> subjectModule : Confirmation of Update
subjectModule -> ui : Display Success Message
ui -> archivist : Confirmation & Updated Details

```

Explanation of Steps:
1. **Authentication Phase**: The archivist accesses the system and is prompted for authentication. After providing credentials, the authentication service confirms the identity, and the archivist gains access to the system.
2. **Association Phase**:
    - The archivist selects the subject heading they wish to associate with a standard identifier.
    - The UI requests the details of the selected subject heading from the Subject Heading Management Module.
    - The Subject Heading Management Module retrieves and returns the heading details from the Database.
    - The archivist is shown the details and inputs the standard identifier they wish to associate with the subject heading.
    - The UI sends the request to associate the identifier with the heading to the Subject Heading Management Module.
    - The module updates the database with the new identifier.
    - A success message is displayed to the archivist upon the successful update.

This sequence diagram abstractly represents the interactions between the archivist and the system components required to associate a standard identifier with a subject heading in CAMS. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific technologies, interfaces, and protocols used in your actual system architecture.

To create a sequence diagram for the described user story using PlantUML, we need to outline the interactions between the user (Publisher), the DPIE system, and the Open Refine integration for outputting cleaned Data Packages. 

The sequence diagram below describes the process starting from the Publisher's initiation of the cleaning process up to receiving the cleaned Data Package. This includes the user (Publisher) selecting a Data Package to clean, the DPIE system handling the request, engaging with Open Refine for data cleaning, and then returning the cleaned Data Package back to the user.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Publisher
participant "DPIE System" as DPIE
participant "Open Refine" as OpenRefine

Publisher -> DPIE: Select Data Package for cleaning
activate DPIE

DPIE -> OpenRefine: Send Data Package
activate OpenRefine
OpenRefine -> OpenRefine: Clean Data Package
OpenRefine -> DPIE: Return Cleaned Data Package
deactivate OpenRefine

DPIE -> Publisher: Output Cleaned Data Package
deactivate DPIE
@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Process:**

1. **Select Data Package for Cleaning:** The Publisher selects and requests cleaning for a specific Data Package.
   
2. **Send Data Package to Open Refine:** The DPIE system, upon receiving the request, forwards the Data Package to Open Refine for cleaning.

3. **Clean Data Package:** Open Refine processes the data, applying the necessary cleaning and enhancement operations as per the Publisher's needs.

4. **Return Cleaned Data Package:** Once the data is cleaned, Open Refine returns the enhanced Data Package to the DPIE system.

5. **Output Cleaned Data Package:** The DPIE system then outputs the cleaned Data Package back to the Publisher, completing the user story's flow.

This sequence diagram captures the core interactions based on the project description and user story provided. It's important to note that more detailed error handling and system-specific interactions can be added based on further project specifications and requirements.

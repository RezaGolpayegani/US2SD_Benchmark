Certainly! The following is a simplified Plant UML sequence diagram illustrating how a Principal Investigator (PI) might interact with the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) to understand the security measures in place for the data, thereby ensuring legal compliance.

Please note that for simplicity, not all possible intermediary steps or the complexity of real-world scenarios are represented. The objective is to give a basic structure on how this communication might happen within the context provided by the DMPTool project description.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Principal Investigator (PI)" as PI
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "Security & Compliance Module" as SecurityModule
participant "Legal Compliance Database" as ComplianceDB
participant "Data Management Plan (DMP)" as DMP
participant "Report Generator" as ReportGenerator

PI -> Interface: Request information on data security
Interface -> SecurityModule: Query security measures
SecurityModule -> ComplianceDB: Check compliance requirements
ComplianceDB --> SecurityModule: Return compliance standards
SecurityModule -> DMP: Access stored security protocols
DMP --> SecurityModule: Provide security details
SecurityModule -> ReportGenerator: Compile security and compliance information
ReportGenerator --> Interface: Generate compliance report
Interface --> PI: Display security and compliance report

**Explanation:**

1. **Principal Investigator (PI) starts the process**: The PI uses the DMPTool Interface to request information about the security measures in place for their data, specifically to ensure they're in compliance with legal requirements.

2. **Interface to Security & Compliance Module**: The request is transmitted to the Security & Compliance Module of the DMPTool, which initiates the process of gathering necessary information.

3. **Query Legal Compliance Database**: The Security & Compliance Module checks with an internal or external Legal Compliance Database to understand which compliance standards are applicable. This might depend on the type of data, its geographical location, and specific industry or research field standards.

4. **Access Data Management Plan (DMP)**: After understanding the compliance requirements, the module accesses the relevant DMP to retrieve stored data security protocols and measures.

5. **Compile Report**: With the information on security measures and compliance standards at hand, the Security & Compliance Module works with the Report Generator feature of the DMPTool to compile a comprehensive report on how the data's security complies with relevant legal standards.

6. **Display Report to PI**: The report is then presented back to the PI through the DMPTool Interface, providing them with a detailed overview of the security and compliance status of their data.

By going through this process, the PI can ensure that the data management and security measures are aligned with legal compliance requirements, thus making informed decisions on how to manage their research data securely.

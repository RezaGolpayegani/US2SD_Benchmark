Generating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the member's number" involves illustrating the interactions between the system components when a library manager wants to fetch and view a member's number (or count of members) in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as mgr
participant WebInterface as web
participant AuthenticationSystem as auth
participant Database as db
participant ReportingTool as report

mgr -> web : Request to view member's number
web -> auth : Authenticate manager credentials
auth -> web : Authentication successful
web -> db : Query to fetch member's number
db -> web : Return member's number
web -> report : Generate report of member's number
report -> web : Report generated with member's number
web -> mgr : Display member's number report

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

- **Manager to Web Interface**: The manager (library manager) initiates the process by requesting to view the member's number through the web interface of CLMS.
- **Web Interface to Authentication System**: The web interface forwards this request to the authentication system to ensure that the requesting user has the appropriate manager credentials to access sensitive data.
- **Authentication System to Web Interface**: The authentication system processes the credentials and, upon successful authentication, confirms back to the web interface that the request is authorized.
- **Web Interface to Database**: With authentication confirmed, the web interface then sends a query to the system's database to fetch the number of members.
- **Database to Web Interface**: The database processes this query and returns the count of members registered in the library system back to the web interface.
- **Web Interface to Reporting Tool**: The web interface sends the retrieved member's number to the reporting tool component to generate a report. This step formalizes the count into a readable and presentable format for the manager.
- **Reporting Tool to Web Interface**: The reporting tool processes the member number and generates a report, which it sends back to the web interface.
- **Web Interface to Manager**: Finally, the web interface presents the generated report showing the member's number to the manager.

This sequence diagram focuses on providing the count or number of members in the system to a manager, employing system authentication to ensure access is granted appropriately and utilizing a reporting tool for data presentation.

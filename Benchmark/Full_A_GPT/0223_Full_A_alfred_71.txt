To visualize how an older person uses ALFRED to contact people from their own circle, I'll outline a sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This scenario assumes the person uses a voice command to initiate a call or send a message through ALFRED.

Note: This is a textual description of what the PlantUML code will look like. To generate the actual diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or an online editor capable of rendering PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as OP
participant "Voice Recognition" as VR
participant ALFRED as A
database ContactsDB as CDB
participant "Communication Module" as CM

OP -> VR : Says "Call my daughter"
VR -> A : Interprets voice command
A -> CDB : Retrieves daughter's contact
CDB --> A : Contact details
A -> CM : Initiates call
CM --> OP : Connects call to daughter

note over OP,CM : Call is successful, OlderPerson communicates with their daughter

OP -> VR : Says "Send a message to my friend John"
VR -> A : Interprets voice command for message
A -> CDB : Retrieves John's contact
CDB --> A : Contact details
A -> CM : Sends message to John's contact
CM --> OP : Confirms message sent

note over OP,CM : Message successfully sent to John

### Explanation:
1. **OlderPerson (OP)**: Represents the user of ALFred.
2. **Voice Recognition (VR)**: This is the module that captures and initially interprets the voice commands from the user.
3. **ALFRED (A)**: The central unit of the system, handling requests, processing them, and taking appropriate actions.
4. **ContactsDB (CDB)**: The database where contacts are stored, including details necessary for communication.
5. **Communication Module (CM)**: Handles the actual calling or messaging functionality, interfacing with external networks or services as needed.

### How the Sequence Unfolds:
- The Older Person gives a voice command to call a family member ("my daughter") or send a message ("Send a message to my friend John").
- The voice command is captured by the voice recognition module, which sends the interpreted command to ALFRED.
- ALFRED processes this command and checks the Contacts Database (CDB) for the contact details of the specified individual.
- Once the contact details are retrieved, ALFRED communicates with the Communication Module to either place a call or send a message.
- The Communication Module then performs the requested action and confirms its execution to the Older Person.

This sequence diagram outlines a high-level interaction between an older person and the ALFRED system for the purpose of maintaining social contacts. This storyboard can be further elaborated with additional scenarios or error handling steps as needed.

To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see the list of members" in PlantUML format, we need to outline the interaction between the system components involved in fulfilling this request. Let's assume the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) comprises a user interface for the librarian, a backend server handling business logic, and a database system storing all data related to members and books.

Here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that represents the interactions for the librarian to view the list of members:

```
@startuml

actor Librarian as librarian
participant "UI: Librarian Dashboard" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
database "Library Database" as db

librarian -> ui: Selects "View Members"
ui -> server: GET /members
server -> db: SELECT * FROM members
db --> server: MembersList
server --> ui: Display MembersList
ui --> librarian: Shows List of Members

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Librarian interacting with the User Interface (UI) of the Librarian Dashboard. The sequence is as follows:

1. The Librarian selects the option to "View Members" on the UI.
2. The UI makes a GET request to the Backend Server, asking for the list of all members (this is simplified for understanding; in a real scenario, this might involve authentication and authorization steps to ensure the librarian has the rights to view this information).
3. The Backend Server queries the Library Database with a command to select all records from the members' table.
4. The Library Database returns the list of members to the Backend Server.
5. The Backend Server then sends this list back to the UI.
6. The UI displays the list of members to the Librarian.

Remember, this is a straightforward scenario. Real-world applications may involve more layers of interaction, error handling, security checks, and data processing to ensure efficient and secure access to the data.

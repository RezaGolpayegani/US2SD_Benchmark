Certainly! To generate a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the user story of a developer obtaining app development support from ALFRED, we need to illustrate the interactions involved in this process. Below is an example of how this interaction might look, broken down step-by-step. Please note, as ALFRED is a fictional platform, some of the steps are based on common practices in similar platforms.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Developer
participant "Developer Portal" as DP
participant "API Gateway" as API
participant "Support System" as SS
participant "Documentation" as DOC
participant "Feedback Channel" as FC

Developer -> DP: Access Developer Portal
activate DP
DP -> API: Request API Access
activate API
API --> DP: Grant API Key
DP --> Developer: Provide API Key
deactivate API

Developer -> SS: Request Support
activate SS
SS --> Developer: Confirm Support Request
Developer -> DOC: Access Documentation
activate DOC
DOC --> Developer: Provide Documentation

Developer -> FC: Submit Feedback
activate FC
FC --> Developer: Acknowledge Feedback
deactivate FC

deactivate DOC
deactivate SS
deactivate DP

This sequence diagram starts with the Developer accessing the ALFRED Developer Portal, where they request API access. The API Gateway processes this request and grants an API Key back to the Developer through the Portal.

Next, the Developer may request support, for which the Support System confirms the receipt of the request. To further aid development, the Developer accesses documentation provided by ALFRED. This documentation could include API guides, development kits, example applications, and more, depending on the specifics of the ALFRED system.

Lastly, the Developer submits feedback on the development process using a Feedback Channel, which acknowledges the receipt of feedback. This step is crucial for continuous improvement and developer satisfaction.

This diagram is a simplified illustration, and actual implementation details may vary based on the specific requirements and architecture of the ALFRED system. It assumes a web-based interface for the Developer Portal, but other interfaces could be used.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a camp administrator, I want to be able to modify the information of added parents, so that I can keep a parent's information up to date" involves illustrating how different system components and actors interact with each other for the use case. The sequence diagram below uses PlantUML syntax to show these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Camp Administrator" as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Database" as db

admin -> dashboard : Selects Parent Management
dashboard -> db : Retrieve parent information
db -> dashboard : Display parent information
admin -> dashboard : Chooses parent to modify
dashboard -> db : Query selected parent details
db -> dashboard : Show details for modification
admin -> dashboard : Modifies parent info
dashboard -> db : Update parent information
db -> dashboard : Confirm update
dashboard -> admin : Show update confirmation

@enduml
```

Here's a brief explanation of the depicted interactions:

1. **Camp Administrator to Admin Dashboard**: The camp administrator initiates the process by selecting the Parent Management option within the Admin Dashboard.
2. **Admin Dashboard to Database**: The Admin Dashboard requests all parent information stored in the database to be retrieved.
3. **Database to Admin Dashboard**: The database returns the list of parent information to be displayed for the camp administrator.
4. **Camp Administrator to Admin Dashboard**: After reviewing, the camp administrator chooses a specific parent's information to modify.
5. **Admin Dashboard to Database**: Requests the selected parent's details from the database.
6. **Database to Admin End**: Returns the selected parentâ€™s details for modification.
7. **Camp Administrator to Admin Dashboard**: Modifies the necessary parent information through the dashboard interface.
8. **Admin Dashboard to Database**: Submits the updated parent information to the database for storage.
9. **Database to Admin Dashboard**: Confirms the update has been made successfully.
10. **Admin Dashboard to Camp Administrator**: Presents a confirmation to the camp administrator that the parent's information has been updated.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the steps involved when a camp administrator wants to modify a parent's information in the system, emphasizing the flow of data between the administrator, the system's GUI (Graphical User Interface), and the backend database where parent information is stored and managed.

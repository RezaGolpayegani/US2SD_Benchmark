Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate the process of tracking draft proffers by a staff member requires focusing on the interactions between the staff member, the digital portal (County Services & Property Information Portal), and any supporting backend systems or databases involved in preserving the history of draft proffer statements. 

Given the complexity of the system described in your project, I will outline a generic process that might occur when a staff member aims to track draft proffers submitted by an applicant. This process includes steps from the moment the staff member decides to track the document to when the history is successfully recorded in the system.

Here is a basic PlantUML code snippet to represent this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as Staff
entity "County Services & \nProperty Information Portal" as Portal
database "Application & User \nDatabase" as Database

== Track Draft Proffer ==
Staff -> Portal : Navigate to Draft Proffer Tracking Section
Portal -> Database : Request Existing Draft Proffers for Applicant
Database -> Portal : Return List of Draft Proffers
Portal -> Staff : Display Draft Proffers
Staff -> Portal : Select Draft Proffer to Track
Portal -> Database : Request Detailed View of Selected Draft Proffer
Database -> Portal : Return Detailed Proffer Information
Portal -> Staff : Display Draft Proffer Details
Staff -> Portal : Indicate to Save Proffer History
Portal -> Database : Record/Update Proffer History in Database
Database -> Portal : Confirm Proffer History Recorded
Portal -> Staff : Display Confirmation of Updated Proffer History

This sequence diagram starts with the staff member's action to navigate to the pertinent section of the portal designed for tracking draft proffers. The process involves querying the database for existing draft proffers for a specific applicant, displaying these to the staff member, and upon selection by the staff member, presenting detailed information of the selected draft proffer. The staff member's decision to save or update the proffer history triggers the system to record this change in the database, culminating in a confirmation message displayed to the staff member.

Please adjust the entities involved (e.g., specific databases or subsystems), actions, and flow according to the actual architecture and functionality of your County Services & Property Information Portal for a more precise representation.

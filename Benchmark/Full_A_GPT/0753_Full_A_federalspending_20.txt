Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story "As an Agency user, I want to be able to include a large number of flexfields without performance impact" involves illustrating the interactions between the Agency User, Broker System (potentially including different components like the UI, Backend Server, and Database), and any other systems involved in processing the inclusion of a large number of flexfields efficiently.

Given the complexity and the abstract nature of this process, the following PlantUML code provides a simplified depiction focusing on key steps like providing flexfields, processing them in the backend, and ensuring no performance degradation. This is a high-level representation; actual implementations may include more systems or steps based on detailed technical requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AgencyUser as "Agency User"
participant BrokerUI as "Broker UI"
participant BackendServer as "Backend Server"
participant Database as "Database"
participant PerformanceMonitor as "Performance Monitor"

== Flexfields Submission ==
AgencyUser -> BrokerUI : Submit Flexfields Data
BrokerUI -> BackendServer : Validate Flexfields Data
alt Validation Success
    BackendServer -> Database : Store Flexfields Data
    Database --> BackendServer : Acknowledge Storage
    BackendServer --> BrokerUI : Confirm Submission Success
    BrokerUI --> AgencyUser : Display Success Message
else Validation Failure
    BackendServer --> BrokerUI : Error Message
    BrokerUI --> AgencyUser : Display Error Message
end

== Performance Monitoring ==
BackendServer -> PerformanceMonitor : Start Monitoring
loop Performance Check
    PerformanceMonitor -> BackendServer : Check Performance Metrics
    alt Performance Degradation Detected
        PerformanceMonitor -> BackendServer : Notify Degradation
        BackendServer -> Database : Optimize Data Storage
        Database --> BackendServer : Confirm Optimization Complete
        BackendServer --> PerformanceMonitor : Continue Monitoring
    else No Degradation Detected
        PerformanceMonitor --> BackendServer : Performance Stable
    end
end

This diagram illustrates a basic flow where an Agency User submits flexfields data through a UI, which then gets validated and stored by the Backend Server in the Database. It also includes a loop for performance monitoring to detect and address any potential performance degradation due to the data submission, ensuring that the inclusion of a large number of flexfields does not impact system performance negatively.

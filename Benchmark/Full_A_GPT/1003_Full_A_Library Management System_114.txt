Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format depicting the process of calculating fines for delayed returns from the perspective of a library manager within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Please note, in a real implementation, some steps could be simplified or more detailed based on actual system design and requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "Library Manager" as LM
participant "Library Management\nSystem Interface" as LMS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Fines Calculator" as FC

LM -> LMS : Request to calculate fines
activate LM
activate LMS

LMS -> DB : Get Return Details\n(Book ID, User ID, Due Date)
activate DB

DB -> DB: Fetch details
DB --> LMS : Return Details

LMS -> FC : Calculate fines based on\nDue Date and Current Date
activate FC

FC -> FC : Compute fines
FC --> LMS : Fines Information

LMS -> DB : Update User Account\nwith fines
DB -> DB : Update operation
DB --> LMS : Update Confirmation

LMS --> LM : Display fines information and\nConfirmation of update
deactivate DB
deactivate FC
deactivate LMS
deactivate LM

This sequence diagram illustrates the process flow from the library manager's request to calculate fines for delayed returns, going through the system interface, involving data retrieval and update from the database, and utilizing a fines calculator component to compute fines based on due dates and current dates. Afterwards, it shows the update of the user's account with the calculated fines and the confirmation of this update to the library manager.

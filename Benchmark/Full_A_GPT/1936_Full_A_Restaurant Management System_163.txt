To generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to read an employee data," we need to outline the main components and steps involved in this process. The diagram will illustrate the interactions between the manager (user), the system interface, backend services, and the database in fetching employee data.

Here's a basic sequence diagram written in PlantUML format to represent this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "System Interface" as SI
participant "Backend Service" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> SI : Request Employee Data
activate SI
SI -> BS : Fetch Employee Data
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query Employee Information
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return Employee Data
deactivate DB
BS --> SI : Employee Data Response
deactivate BS
SI --> M : Display Employee Data
deactivate SI
@enduml
```

This diagram can be run in any PlantUML editor or tool that supports PlantUML syntax. Below is the explanation of the steps represented in the sequence diagram:

1. **Manager Request**: The process begins with the manager requesting to read an employee's data. This action could be triggered through a UI component like clicking a button or selecting an employee profile.

2. **System Interface**: This represents the front-end part of the system where the manager interacts. It takes the request and forwards it to the backend service to process this request.

3. **Backend Service**: This layer is responsible for handling business logic, including validating the manager's permissions to view employee data (not depicted in the diagram for simplicity but important in a real-world application), and fetching the requested data.

4. **Database Query**: The backend service sends a request to the database to fetch the requested employee's data. This involves querying the database with an identifier (like an employee ID).

5. **Data Return**: The database returns the requested data to the backend service. This step involves the database accessing the employee's record and returning it to the requestor.

6. **Display Data**: Finally, the employee's data is sent back through the system interface to the manager, who can then view the employee's information.

This sequence diagram illustrates a simple interaction sequence for reading an employee's data based on the provided user story. Depending on the system's complexity and requirements, additional steps such as error handling, data processing, and security checks (like authentication and authorization) might be included in a more detailed diagram.

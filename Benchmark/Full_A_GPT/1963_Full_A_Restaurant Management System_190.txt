Given the specific requirements of generating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: "As a manager, I want to see the daily customer average, so that I can adjust optimal employees for the day," below is a textual representation of how the sequence diagram for this user story could be structured. Note that to visualize this as a diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment (like an online editor or a local setup with the required tooling).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Analytics Module" as AM
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> MI: Request daily customer average
activate MI
MI -> AM: Retrieve daily customer average
activate AM
AM -> DB: Query customer entries
activate DB
DB --> AM: Return entries
deactivate DB
AM --> MI: Calculate average
deactivate AM
MI --> Manager: Display daily customer average
deactivate MI

note right of Manager
  Manager assesses average customer number
  to adjust employee shifts for optimal
  operation.
end note

### Explanation of the Diagram:

- **Manager to Management Interface**: The sequence starts with the manager requesting the daily customer average from the management interface. This is the initial interaction from the user (Manager) as per the user story.

- **Management Interface to Analytics Module**: The management interface then forwards this request to the analytics module, which is responsible for processing such queries.

- **Analytics Module to Database**: The analytics module makes a query to the database to retrieve all entries related to customers for that day. This step involves fetching the required data to calculate the average.

- **Database to Analytics Module**: The database returns these entries to the analytics module. This includes all the detailed data which may involve customer check-ins and check-outs.

- **Analytics Module calculates the average**: Based on this data, the analytics module calculates the average number of customers for the day.

- **Management Interface displays average**: Finally, the calculated average number of customers is sent back to the manager via the management interface where it's displayed.

This sequence outlines how the system handles the manager's request to view the daily customer average, integrating various system components from the interface the manager interacts with, down to the database that houses the necessary data.

Remember, to visualize this as a diagram, you'd need to run this through a PlantUML processor or editor.

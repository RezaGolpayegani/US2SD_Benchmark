Given the complexity of the project described and focusing on the particular user story regarding a library discovery operator wanting to harvest useful metadata from the repository via the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), I'll provide a simplified PlantUML code to visualize the sequence of interactions. This diagram will illustrate the process of harvesting metadata incrementally for making Cornell publications discoverable in an external repository.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryDiscoveryOperator as operator
entity "OAI-PMH Service" as OAI
database "Digital Repository System" as Repository
entity "External Discovery System" as External

operator -> OAI: Request Metadata\n(Initial Harvest)
activate OAI
OAI -> Repository: Query for Available Metadata
activate Repository
Repository -> OAI: Return Requested Metadata
deactivate Repository
OAI -> operator: Respond with Metadata
deactivate OAI
operator -> External: Update Discovery System\nwith Metadata
activate External
External --> operator: Acknowledge Update
deactivate External

... Some Time Later ...

operator -> OAI: Request Updated Metadata\n(Incremental Harvest)
activate OAI
OAI -> Repository: Query for New/Updated Metadata
activate Repository
Repository -> OAI: Return New/Updated Metadata
deactivate Repository
OAI -> operator: Respond with Updated Metadata
deactivate OAI
operator -> External: Update Discovery System\nwith New Metadata
activate External
External --> operator: Acknowledge Update\n(Incremental)
deactivate External

### Explanation:
1. **LibraryDiscoveryOperator**: This actor represents the library discovery operator who initiates requests to harvest metadata from Cornell's Digital Repository System.
   
2. **OAI-PMH Service**: This service acts as an intermediary that facilitates the harvesting of metadata by understanding and implementing the OAI-PMH protocol. It processes requests from the Library Discovery Operator and queries the Digital Repository System for metadata.

3. **Digital Repository System**: This is Cornell University's comprehensive repository that holds all the scholarly output, data, and publications. It serves the metadata requested by the OAI-PMH Service based on the specifications of the request (initial or incremental).

4. **External Discovery System**: This represents an external system where the harvested metadata is used to update the repository's discoverability and accessibility of Cornell publications.

### Flow of Interaction:
- The Library Discovery Operator sends a request to the OAI-PMH Service to harvest metadata. Initially, this might be for all available metadata in the Digital Repository System.
- The OAI-PMH Service queries the repository for the available metadata.
- The repository responds with the requested metadata.
- The Library Discovery Operator uses the metadata to update the External Discovery System, making Cornell publications discoverable.
- At a later time, the operator requests updated metadata to capture new or updated records since the last harvest (incremental harvest).
- The process repeats, with the repository only returning metadata that has changed or been added since the last request, ensuring that the discovery system remains up-to-date with minimal data transfer.

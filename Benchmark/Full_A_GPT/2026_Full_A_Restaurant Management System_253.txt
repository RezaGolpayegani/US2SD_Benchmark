Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a restaurant manager, I want to see the cost of menu calls for detailing the steps involved in this request. Below is a basic PlantUML sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction flow among the Restaurant Management System components when a manager requests to see the cost of menu items. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant Frontend as frontend
participant Backend as backend
participant "Database\n(MongoDB or PostgreSQL)" as database

manager -> frontend : Requests cost of menu items
frontend -> backend : Fetch cost of menu items
backend -> database : Query menu item costs
database --> backend : Return menu item costs
backend --> frontend : Display menu item costs
frontend --> manager : Shows menu item costs
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Manager**: Initiates a request to see the cost of menu items. This is the starting point of the sequence.
- **Frontend (React.js/Angular)**: Receives the manager's request. This layer is responsible for the user interface through which the manager interacts with the system.
- **Backend (Node.js with Express)**: Handles the request forwarded by the frontend. It processes the logic necessary to fulfill the manager's requirement.
- **Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)**: Stores and retrieves data regarding the menu items, including their costs. The backend communicates with the database to fetch the required information.
- **Flow of Events**:
  1. The Manager initiates a request to view the costs of menu items through the Frontend interface.
  2. The Frontend forwards this request to the Backend.
  3. The Backend processes this request and queries the Database for the costs of the menu items.
  4. The Database returns the cost details of the menu items to the Backend.
  5. The Backend then sends this information back to the Frontend.
  6. Finally, the Frontend displays the menu item costs to the Manager.

This diagram represents a simplified view of the process. Depending on the project requirements, additional steps or actors (like APIs for third-party services) can be integrated into the sequence.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in a text format suitable for Plant UML is a bit challenging, given the complexity and the broad scope of the DPIE project. However, I'll give you an example of how you can approach such a sequence diagram focusing on the developer customizing an existing wizard for a specific type of data.

This Plant UML script assumes that the developer is working with a generic DataPackage Wizard, which allows customization for specific data types. Note that the actual process might involve more or fewer steps based on the specific implementation details of the DPIE project and the wizard's architecture.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer as D
participant "Wizard Configuration" as WC
participant "Data Type Module" as DTM
participant "Data Package API" as API
participant "User Interface" as UI

D -> WC : Access Wizard Configuration
activate WC
WC -> DTM : Retrieve Available Modules
DTM -> WC : Return Modules
WC -> D : Display Modules
D -> WC : Select Specific Module for Customization
activate DTM
WC -> DTM : Load Selected Module Configuration
DTM -> WC : Display Configuration Options
WC -> D : Customize Module (Fields, Validation, etc.)
D -> DTM : Submit Customization
DTM -> DTM : Validate Customization
alt Customization Valid
    DTM -> API : Update Module with Customization
    API -> DTM : Confirm Update
    DTM -> WC : Notify Success
    WC -> D : Display Success Message
else Customization Invalid
    DTM -> WC : Notify Error
    WC -> D : Display Error Message
end

alt User Interface Generation
    DTM -> UI : Generate Custom UI Components
    UI -> DTM : Confirm UI Components
    DTM -> WC : Update Wizard with Custom UI
    WC -> D : Display Updated Wizard Preview
end

deactivate DTM
deactivate WC

This diagram captures the following steps:
1. **Developer Accesses Wizard Configuration**: The developer starts by accessing the configuration options of the existing wizard.
2. **Retrieve and Display Available Modules**: The wizard configures interface queries and displays available modules for customization.
3. **Selection and Customization**: The developer selects a module to customize for their specific data before submitting their customizations (like fields to include, validation rules, etc.).
4. **Validation and Update**: The customization is validated; if valid, the module is updated via the API, otherwise, an error message is shown.
5. **User Interface Generation (optional)**: Custom UI components can be generated based on the customization to enhance the user experience.

Remember, this is a simplified and conceptual sequence intended to illustrate a possible interaction flow within the DPIE project framework. The actual implementation details might differ, and additional steps or interactions may be required depending on the project's specific technical architecture and requirements.

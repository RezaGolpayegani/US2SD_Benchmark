Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story, "As a Data Publishing User, I want to provide the Platform Administrator with additional GeoJSON sources, so that I can improve the map-based visualizations of my data," entails illustrating the interactions between the user, the system components, and the administrator involved in submitting and integrating GeoJSON sources into the OpenSpending system. Below is an example of how this interaction might be captured in PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Publishing User" as User
participant "Data Submission Form" as Form
database "OpenSpending Platform" as Platform
actor "Platform Administrator" as Admin

User -> Form : Navigate to submission form
activate Form

User -> Form : Upload GeoJSON Source
Form -> Platform : Validate GeoJSON Format
alt Valid GeoJSON
    Platform -> Form : Display Success Message
    deactivate Form
    Form -> User : Notify Upload Success
    
    User -> Platform : Submit GeoJSON for Review
    Platform -> Admin : Send GeoJSON for Approval
    
    Admin -> Platform : Review GeoJSON Source
    alt GeoJSON Approved
        Admin -> Platform : Approve GeoJSON Source
        Platform -> Admin : Integrate GeoJSON into Map Visualization
        Platform -> User : Notify Approval and Update
    
    else GeoJSON Rejected
        Admin -> Platform : Reject GeoJSON Source with Feedback
        Platform -> User : Notify Rejection and Feedback
    end
else Invalid GeoJSON
    Platform -> Form : Display Error Message
    Form -> User : Notify Upload Failure
    deactivate Form
end

This sequence diagram starts with the "Data Publishing User" navigating to a data submission form on the platform. The user uploads a GeoJSON source which the platform validates. If the GeoJSON is valid, the user is notified of the successful upload, and they can then submit it for review. The "Platform Administrator" reviews the submitted GeoJSON source. If approved, the administrator integrates the GeoJSON into the map visualization feature of the OpenSpending platform, and the user is notified. If the GeoJSON source is rejected, the user also receives a notification along with feedback. The sequence includes conditions handling both the approval and rejection pathways to ensure clarity on the process flow.

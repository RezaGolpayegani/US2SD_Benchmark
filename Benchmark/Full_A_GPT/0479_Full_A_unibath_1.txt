To represent the user story in a sequence diagram focusing on a depositor intending to deposit and maintain datasets through a web interface, we'll assume a number of steps and actors involved in this process. The scenario starts with the depositor accessing the web interface, submitting a dataset, and then managing it (which includes actions like applying licenses, attaching metadata, and tracking citations or downloads).

Given the complexity and the multiple operations described in the user story, the sequence diagram will focus on key interactions. Note that in practice, interactions might be more complex, depending on the system's architecture and the specific implementation of the platform.

Here's a simplified PlantUML code example to illustrate these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "Data Management \nSystem" as DMS
participant "Metadata Service" as Meta
participant "DOI Service" as DOI
participant "License Management" as License

Depositor -> Web : Access Web Interface
Depositor -> Web : Submits Dataset
Web -> DMS : Store Dataset
activate DMS

DMS -> Meta : Generate Metadata
return Metadata to Web
Web -> Depositor : Confirm Dataset Submission

Depositor -> Web : Apply License
Web -> License : Manage License
License --> Web : License Confirmed

Depositor -> Web : Attach Metadata
Web -> DMS : Update Dataset with Metadata
DMS -> DOI : Request DOI
DOI --> DMS : DOI Generated
DMS --> Web : Dataset Updated
Web -> Depositor : Dataset Updated with DOI

Depositor -> Web : Track Citations/Downloads
Web -> DMS : Query Citations/Downloads
DMS --> Web : Citations/Downloads Data
Web -> Depositor : Display Citations/Downloads

**Explanation:**

1. **Depositor Accesses Web Interface:** The depositor starts by accessing the platform's web interface.
2. **Submission of Dataset:** The depositor submits the dataset through the web interface.
3. **Storage and Metadata Generation:** The dataset is stored in the Data Management System (DMS), which then generates metadata for the dataset.
4. **License Application:** The depositor applies a license to their dataset via the web interface, and the system confirms the license.
5. **Metadata Attachment and DOI Generation:** The depositor attaches additional metadata. The updated dataset is then assigned a DOI for tracking and references.
6. **Citations/Downloads Tracking:** The depositor can also track citations and downloads, with the system providing the relevant data.

This sequence diagram is a high-level overview. Real implementations might require more detailed interactions, especially concerning error handling, data validation, and user authentication/authorization. Remember that the sequence diagram can be refined and expanded based on specific project requirements and technical specifications.

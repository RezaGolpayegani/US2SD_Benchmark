Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that illustrates the user story: "As a library staff member, I want to have customizable metadata fields, so that each project is described in the most accurate way possible." This diagram demonstrates the interactions involved in creating and managing customizable metadata fields by a library staff member within the Comprehensive Digital Repository System for Cornell University.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryStaffMember as staff
participant WebInterface as web
participant MetadataService as metadata
participant Database as db

== Customizable Metadata Field Creation ==
staff -> web : Access Metadata Management
activate web

web -> metadata : Request Field Customization Interface
activate metadata

metadata -> web : Return Customization Form
web -> staff : Display Form

staff -> web : Submit Customized Field Data
web -> metadata : Process Customization Data
activate db

metadata -> db : Store Custom Metadata Field
db -> metadata : Confirm Field Creation

metadata -> web : Confirm Custom Field Added
web -> staff : Display Confirmation Message

== End ==
deactivate db
deactivate metadata
deallocate web

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with a library staff member accessing the Metadata Management interface through the Web Interface. The system (MetadataService) then provides a customization form for the library staff to submit their custom metadata fields. The submitted data is processed, and a new custom metadata field is created and confirmed in the Database, with a confirmation message displayed back to the staff member. 

Please note, the actual implementation may involve more steps and participants (e.g., authentication, validation, backend services) depending on the system's technological stack and detailed requirements.

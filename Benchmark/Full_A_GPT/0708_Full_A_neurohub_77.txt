Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves modeling the interaction between the system components and the user when marking experimental data as good or bad, and hiding the bad data while keeping it in the system. Below is a PlantUML diagram that represents these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as res
participant "Electronic Log Book" as elb
participant "Data Management System" as dms

res -> elb: Access Experiment Entry
activate elb

elb -> dms: Retrieve Experiment Data
activate dms
dms --> elb: Display Data
deactivate dms

res -> elb: Select Data to Evaluate
activate elb

res -> elb: Mark Data as Good/Bad
activate elb

group Marking Bad Data
    elb -> dms: Mark Data as Bad
    activate dms
    dms -> dms: Hide Data in UI
    dms --> elb: Confirm Hide Action
    deactivate dms
    note right of dms: Data remains in the system\nfor potential future use.
end

group Marking Good Data
    elb -> dms: Mark Data as Good
    activate dms
    dms --> elb: Keep Data Visible
    deactivate dms
end

res -> elb: Submit Evaluation
elb -> dms: Update Data Metadata
activate dms
dms --> elb: Confirmation Message
deactivate dms

deactivate elb

This diagram details the steps a researcher would take to interact with the electronic log book and data management system within Neurohub. It reflects the procedure for marking experimental data as good or bad, hiding the bad data from the UI while ensuring it remains in the system for potential future use, and finally updating the data's metadata to reflect these changes. Note that the sequence diagram abstracts away some of the backend complexities, focusing instead on the key interactions that realize the user story.

Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story you provided. This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between an anonymous user and the systems involved in viewing a list of attendees associated with a sponsor organization on the BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform. Please note that for actual software development, more details and specific implementation aspects should be considered.

This sequence diagram starts with the anonymous user accessing the sponsor list page on the web interface. The web interface then requests a list of sponsors from the Sponsor Module, which queries the Attendees Database for the information. Once the sponsor information is returned and displayed, the user selects a sponsor to view more details. The web interface requests the list of attendees associated with the selected sponsor from the Sponsor Module. The Sponsor Module again interacts with the Attendees Database to fetch this specific information. Finally, the list of attendees associated with the sponsor is displayed to the anonymous user.

Remember, this is a simplified representation. Depending on the application's complexity and specific requirements, more actors, such as security components for handling authentication and authorization, even for anonymous users accessing certain types of data, could be added to the diagram.

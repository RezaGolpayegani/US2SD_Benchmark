Given the complexity of the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) and the specific needs outlined in the user story, a detailed sequence diagram can be designed to model the interactions among various system components and actors to fulfill the user story requirements. The PlantUML code provided below describes the sequence of actions a Data Manager takes to verify dependencies of collected data on other datasets within the DMPTool ecosystem.

Please note, to render this sequence diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML tool or any compatible application that supports PlantUML code execution.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant DataManager as DM
participant "DMPTool Interface" as UI
participant "Metadata Repository" as MR
participant "External Datasets API" as EDA
participant "Dependency Verification Module" as DVM
database "Institutional Data Storage" as IDS

DM --> UI : Request data dependency check
UI -> DVM : Initiate dependency verification
DVM -> MR : Retrieve dataset metadata
MR --> DVM : Metadata including external dependencies
DVM -> EDA : Query for external dataset information
note right of EDA : Queries include\ninstitutional and external\ndatasets dependencies
EDA --> DVM : External datasets details
DVM -> IDS : Check for institutional datasets linkage
IDS --> DVM : Institutional linkage information
DVM --> UI : Display dependency verification results
UI --> DM : Show results (dependencies & missing links)

### Sequence of Actions:
1. **Data Manager Requests Dependency Check**: The sequence begins when the data manager requests a check for data dependencies through the DMPTool Interface.
2. **Initiate Dependency Verification**: The interface communicates this request to the Dependency Verification Module.
3. **Retrieve Dataset Metadata**: This module then requests the necessary dataset metadata from the Metadata Repository.
4. **Metadata Including External Dependencies**: The Metadata Repository returns the requested dataset metadata, which includes information on external dependencies.
5. **Query External Dataset Information**: The Dependency Verification Module uses the external dependencies information to query the External Datasets API for more details.
6. **External Datasets Details**: The API responds with detailed information about the external datasets, including their availability and access protocols.
7. **Check Institutional Data Storage**: The Verification Module also queries the Institutional Data Storage to check for any institutional linkages of the dataset.
8. **Institutional Linkage Information**: The Institutional Data Storage provides information about any internal datasets the current dataset depends on.
9. **Display Dependency Verification Results**: The Dependency Verification Module consolidates the gathered information and sends the results back to the DMPTool Interface.
10. **Show Results**: Finally, the data manager is presented with the results, showing any identified dependencies and potentially missing data links.

This sequence diagram and the steps detailed above demonstrate a high-level overview of how the DMPTool can facilitate data managers in verifying dataset dependencies across institutional and external sources.

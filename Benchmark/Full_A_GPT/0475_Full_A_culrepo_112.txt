Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting the interactions between different actors and system components necessary to facilitate the transfer of ownership or management of assets to a successor in the context of the mentioned digital repository system. Since text-based descriptions are more suitable here, I will provide you with a PlantUML code snippet that visualizes this process.

Keep in mind, this proposed sequence diagram is conceptual and simplifies interactions for illustration purposes. Real-world implementations could require more complex interactions, especially considering integrations with existing systems at Cornell University, security protocols, and data integrity checks.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AssetManager as AM
actor System as SYS
actor Database as DB
actor Successor as SU

AM -> SYS : RequestTransferOwnership(assetId, successorEmail)
SYS -> DB : LookupAsset(assetId)
DB --> SYS : AssetDetails
SYS -> DB : ValidateSuccessor(successorEmail)
DB --> SYS : SuccessorValidated
SYS -> SU : NotifyPendingTransfer(assetId)
SU --> SYS : AcceptTransfer(assetId)
SYS -> DB : TransferOwnership(assetId, successorId)
DB --> SYS : TransferConfirmed
SYS --> SU : TransferSuccessfulNotification
SYS --> AM : ConfirmTransferSuccess(assetId, successorEmail)

**Explanation of the Sequence:**

1. **Asset Manager Initiates Transfer:** The Asset Manager (`AM`) requests to transfer ownership/management of the assets, identifying the asset by its ID and providing the successor's email.

2. **System Validates Requests:** The system (`SYS`) checks the asset details from the database (`DB`) using the provided asset ID.

3. **Successor Validation:** The system validates the existence and eligibility of the successor via the successor's email.

4. **Notification to Successor:** Upon successful validation, the system notifies the prospective successor (`SU`) about the pending transfer.

5. **Acceptance by Successor:** The successor accepts the transfer, confirming their willingness to manage the asset.

6. **Transfer Processed:** The system executes the transfer in the database, updating the asset's ownership/management records.

7. **Confirmation to Stakeholders:** Both the asset manager and the successor receive notifications confirming the successful transfer.

This sequence diagram simplifies many aspects, lacking error handling, authorization checks, and in-depth validation processing for clarity and focus on the main interactions involved in asset ownership transfer within the digital repository system.

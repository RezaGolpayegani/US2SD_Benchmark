Certainly! Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram script for the user story: "As a member of the library, I want to see the unique identification number of a book." This user story involves interactions primarily between the user (library member), the front-end interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), back-end server, and the database system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

== User Requests Book Details ==
Member -> Frontend : Search for book
activate Frontend
Frontend -> Backend : Request book details
activate Backend

== Backend Processes Request ==
Backend -> DB : Query book information
activate DB
DB -> Backend : Return book details including Unique ID
deactivate DB

== Backend Responds with Book Details ==
Backend -> Frontend : Display book details (including Unique ID)
deactivate Backend
Frontend -> Member : Show book details and Unique ID
deactivate Frontend

### Explanation:
1. **Member (Library User)**:
   - Initiates the process by searching for a book through the Frontend Interface of the CLMS.

2. **Frontend Interface (CLMS's Web Interface)**:
   - Receives the search request from the member.
   - Sends a request to the Backend Server for the book's details, including its unique identification number.

3. **Backend Server**:
   - Processes the request from the Frontend Interface.
   - Communicates with the Database to fetch the details about the book requested by the user.

4. **Database**:
   - Holds all data related to books, including their unique identification numbers.
   - Upon request from the Backend Server, it returns the book's details, including the unique identification number.

5. **Process Flow**:
   - After the Database sends back the requested book's details, the information flows back to the member through the Backend Server and the Frontend Interface, allowing the member to see the book's unique identification number.

This sequence diagram gives a high-level overview of the process from the moment a library member wants to see a book's unique identification number to the system displaying that information. Adjustments and enhancements can be made based on specific system requirements and technical design decisions.

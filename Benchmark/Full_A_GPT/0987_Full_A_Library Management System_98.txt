Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the librarian, the library management system (CLMS), and potentially other entities involved in the process of checking when a borrowed book will return. Below is a PlantUML script that visualizes these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
database "CLMS Database" as Database

Librarian -> Interface : Access book management section
activate Interface

Interface -> Database : Query to find the borrowed book details
activate Database
Database --> Interface : Return book details including due date
deactivate Database

Interface --> Librarian : Display borrowed book return date
deactivate Interface

Librarian -> Interface : Query for waiting list of the book
activate Interface

Interface -> Database : Fetch waiting list for the book
activate Database
Database --> Interface : Return list of users waiting for the book
deactivate Database

Interface --> Librarian : Display list of users demanding the book
deactivate Interface

Librarian -> Interface : Select notification option for users
activate Interface

Interface -> Database : Trigger notification process for waiting users
activate Database
Database --> Interface : Confirm notifications sent
deactivate Database

Interface --> Librarian : Confirm successful notification to users
deactivate Interface

This sequence diagram starts with the librarian accessing the book management section of the CLMS to check the return date of a borrowed book. The system subsequently queries the database for the details of the book, including its due date, and displays this information to the librarian. The librarian then checks if there are any users on the waiting list for this book and chooses to notify them. The CLMS processes this request and confirms the successful notification to the librarian.

Please note, to render this diagram, you need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML syntax.

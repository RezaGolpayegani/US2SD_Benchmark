Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves representing the interactions between the data user and the system components to achieve the functionality of showing the office names derived from office codes. The sequence involves a user requesting this specific data and the system responding by fetching and displaying the correct office names. We'll use PlantUML syntax to outline these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Data User" as user
participant "UI" as ui
participant "Broker Platform" as broker
database "Office Database" as database

user -> ui : Request office names
ui -> broker : Fetch office codes
broker -> database : Query office names by codes
database --> broker : Return office names
broker --> ui : Display office names
ui --> user : Show office names with context
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Data User requesting to see office names. The request is first processed in the UI, which then communicates with the Broker Platform to fetch the corresponding office codes. The Broker Platform queries the Office Database with these codes to retrieve the office names. Once the names are returned to the Broker Platform, they are passed back to the UI, which finally displays the office names with their context to the Data User.

This diagram is simplified to focus on the key interactions and components involved in accomplishing the user story. Depending on the complexity of the system, additional details such as error handling, security checks, or more nuanced data processing steps might also be included in a more detailed sequence diagram.

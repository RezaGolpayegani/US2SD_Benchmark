Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a cook, I want to be able to edit customer orders" involves showcasing the interaction between systems, actors, and components within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Since PlantUML syntax is plain text, it can be represented as such. 

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram in text format that illustrates this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Cook
participant "Cook's Interface" as CookInterface
participant "Order Management System" as OrderSystem
participant "Database" as DB

Cook -> CookInterface : Selects 'Edit Order' option
CookInterface -> OrderSystem : Requests current order details
OrderSystem -> DB : Retrieves selected order details
DB --> OrderBoardSystem : Returns order details
OrderSystem --> CookInterface : Displays current order details

Cook -> CookInterface : Modifies order items
CookInterface -> OrderSystem : Sends updated order details
OrderSystem -> DB : Updates the order in database
DB --> OrderSystem : Confirms update success
OrderSystem --> CookInterface : Displays update confirmation
CookInterface --> Cook : Shows success notification

```

This sequence diagram breaks down the process as follows:

1. **Cook Interaction:** The cook initiates the process by selecting the option to edit an order via the Cook's Interface.
2. **Request Current Order Details:** The Cook's Interface requests the current details of the order from the Order Management System, which then retrieves this information from the Database.
3. **Display Order Details:** The Order Management System receives the order details from the Database and displays them on the Cook's Interface.
4. **Modify Order:** The cook makes the desired modifications to the order items through the Cook's Interface.
5. **Update Order:** The modified order details are sent back to the Order Management System, which updates the order in the Database.
6. **Confirmation:** Upon successful update, the Order Management System receives a confirmation from the Database, and this success is relayed back to the Cook's Interface, which notifies the cook of the update's success.

It's worth noting that, for simplicity, error handling and more complex interactions (like editing orders that have already begun preparation) are not detailed in this diagram. In a real-world scenario, additional steps might include confirmation dialogs, validation checks (e.g., preventing certain edits based on order status), and notifications to other relevant parties (such as servers or the front of house management software) about the change in the order.

To illustrate the sequence of events described in the user story "As a customer, I want to see my favorite foods from the screen, so that I can quickly order the food that I preferred before," a sequence diagram can be created using PlantUML.

This diagram will include several actors and components like the Customer, the User Interface (UI), the Backend System, and the Database. It will outline the steps involved in selecting and viewing favorite foods, leading to making an order based on those preferences.

Here is an example sequence diagram in PlantUML format that reflects this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Customer
participant "UI" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> UI : Select "View Favorites"
UI -> Backend : Request favorite dishes
Backend -> DB : Query customer's favorite dishes
DB -> Backend : Return favorite dishes
Backend -> UI : Display favorite dishes
UI -> Customer : Show list of favorite dishes

Customer -> UI : Choose dish from favorites
UI -> Backend : Send order request
Backend -> DB : Log order
DB -> Backend : Confirm order logged
Backend -> UI : Confirm order to customer
UI -> Customer : Show order confirmation
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Customer selects the option to "View Favorites" on the UI:** This is the starting point where the customer interacts with the user interface to see their favorite dishes.

2. **UI requests favorite dishes from the Backend System:** The user interface forwards the customer's request to the backend system to retrieve the list of favorite dishes.

3. **Backend System queries the Database:** The backend system makes a query to the database to fetch the favorite dishes of the customer based on their preferences or previous orders.

4. **Database returns favorite dishes:** The database provides the requested information back to the backend system.

5. **Backend System sends favorite dishes to the UI:** The backend system processes the information and sends it to the UI to be displayed to the customer.

6. **UI shows the list of favorite dishes to the Customer:** The customer can now view their list of favorite dishes and make a selection.

7. **Customer chooses a dish from favorites and UI sends order request to Backend:** Upon selecting a favorite dish, this action is communicated back to the backend system by the UI.

8. **Backend logs the order in the Database:** The chosen dish by the customer is logged as an order in the database.

9. **Database confirms the order is logged, and Backend confirms the order to the UI:** The backend system confirms that the order has been successfully recorded.

10. **UI shows order confirmation to the Customer:** Finally, the customer receives an order confirmation, completing the process of ordering food from their list of favorites.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the different components in the system to fulfill the user story of viewing and ordering favorite foods.

Creating a full and detailed sequence diagram for upgrading to Fedora 4 and migrating applications and data in a single PlantUML script would be complex due to the broad scope of activities involved. However, we can sketch a simplified sequence diagram focusing on the key steps a developer might take during this process.

The scenario involves interactions between the Developer, the Existing Fedora Repository (assumed to be a version older than 4), the New Fedora 4 Repository, and possibly a Data Migration Tool if the process isn't entirely manual. Remember, actual implementation details can significantly vary based on the specific environment, data structures, and applications in use.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
boundary "Existing Fedora Repository" as EFR
boundary "New Fedora 4 Repository" as NFR
database "Migration Database" as MDB
control "Data Migration Tool" as DMT

== Preparation ==
Developer -> EFR : Assess current version\nand data structure
Developer -> NFR : Install Fedora 4\nConfigure settings
Developer -> DMT : Configure migration tool\nfor data structure & mapping

== Migration ==
Developer -> DMT : Initiate data export from EFR
EFR -> MDB : Extract data\nand metadata
Developer -> DMT : Transform data\naccording to Fedora 4 requirements
DMT -> NFR : Import data\nand metadata

== Verification and Finalization ==
Developer -> NFR : Validate data integrity\nand functionality
Developer -> NFR : Perform user acceptance testing
Developer --> Developer : Fix issues (if any)\nRepeat validation

== Go-live ==
Developer -> EFR : Decommission or archive
Developer -> NFR : Switch production to Fedora 4

This diagram is simplified and focuses on the key steps:

1. **Preparation**: Benchmarks the start where the Developer assesses the existing setup and prepares the New Fedora 4 Repository along with configuring the Data Migration Tool.
2. **Migration**: Represents the core activity, including data export, transformation, and import.
3. **Verification and Finalization**: Involves ensuring the migrated data works as expected in the new environment.
4. **Go-live**: Marks the decommissioning of the old repository system and the official switch to Fedora 4.

Each step involves interaction between the Developer and various components such as the existing Fedora repository, the new Fedora 4 setup, and the migration tools. This abstracted view is meant to provide a starting framework, with the understanding that each migration project will have its own set of complexities and additional steps.

To generate a sequence diagram for the described user story "As a researcher, I want to search by keyword, so that I can learn what already exists digitally and avoid placing additional duplication requests" in PlantUML format, we'll outline the key actors and systems involved, such as the Researcher, Search Interface, Database, and possibly a Rights Management System if results need to filter based on access rights. Below is a basic outline of how such a sequence might be depicted in PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "Search Interface" as Interface
database "Digital Archive Database" as Database
entity "Rights Management" as Rights

Researcher -> Interface : Enter keyword(s)
Interface -> Database : Query keyword(s)
Database -> Interface : Return results
Interface -> Rights : Check access rights for Researcher
Rights -> Interface : Filter results based on rights
Interface -> Researcher : Display filtered results
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram reflects the process from the perspective of a researcher who is initiating a keyword search through a search interface. The steps include:

1. **Entering Keywords**: The researcher enters the desired keyword(s) into the search interface.
2. **Querying the Database**: The search interface forwards the search query to the digital archive database.
3. **Returning Initial Results**: The database returns the search results (a list of digital files matching the keywords).
4. **Checking Access Rights**: Before presenting the results to the researcher, the system checks with the rights management system to determine which results the researcher is permitted to access.
5. **Filtering Results Based on Rights**: The rights management system filters the initial results based on the researcher's access rights.
6. **Displaying Filtered Results**: Finally, the search interface displays the filtered search results to the researcher, who can then explore the digital files that are available to them.

Remember, this diagram can be expanded or modified to reflect additional complexities or specific features of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project, such as incorporating advanced search options, interacting with specific file types, or user authentication before performing a search.

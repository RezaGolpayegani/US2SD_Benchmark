Given the complexity and broad scope of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, the process of viewing all store orders by an employee encompasses several interactions among different components of the system. Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the steps involved in this process.

Please note that to execute this PlantUML code, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor or an environment that supports PlantUML diagrams like various online editors or IDE plugins.

```
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "UI: Employee Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Controller: Order Management" as Controller
database "Order Database" as Database

Employee -> Dashboard : Selects "View Orders"
Dashboard -> Controller : Request to fetch all orders
activate Controller

Controller -> Database : Query all store orders
activate Database
Database --> Controller : Return all orders
deactivate Database

Controller --> Dashboard : Display orders
deactivate Controller
Dashboard --> Employee : Shows all store orders

```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Employee Interaction**: The sequence starts with the employee selecting the option to view all orders from the employee dashboard in the user interface (UI).
- **Request Handling**: The dashboard sends a request to the backend to fetch all the orders. This action is managed by the Order Management controller.
- **Database Query**: The controller then queries the Order Database to retrieve all the store orders.
- **Display Orders**: Once the database returns the data, the controller processes it and sends it back to the UI, where the dashboard finally presents the orders to the employee.

This sequence diagram outlines a simplified overview of the interactions required for an employee to view all store ON orders within the system. Depending on the specific implementation details, several other steps or components may be involved, such as authentication and authorization checks, error handling, data formatting, and potentially interacting with external services if the system architecture requires it.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a member, I want to locate related books and see the shelf number in the library by using unique ID to speed up the searching process" using PlantUML, you would need to illustrate the sequence of interactions between the user (member), the library management system (CLMS), and any other components involved in the process. Below is an example of how this could be laid out in PlantUML format.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant "Search Interface" as Interface
participant "Library Management System" as LMS
participant Database

Member -> Interface: Enter unique ID
Interface -> LMS: Request book details with unique ID
activate LMS
LMS -> Database: Query book details
activate Database
Database -> Database: Search for book
Database --> LMS: Return book details
deactivate Database
LMS -> LMS: Locate related books
LMS -> Database: Query related books and shelf numbers
activate Database
Database -> Database: Search for related books
Database --> LMS: Return related books and shelf numbers
deactivate Database
LMS --> Interface: Show book and related books with shelf numbers
deactivate LMS
Interface --> Member: Display book information and locations

### Explanation:
1. **Member**: This represents the library member or user initiating the action.
2. **Search Interface**: This is the frontend part of the CLMS where the member inputs the unique ID of the book they are searching for.
3. **Library Management System (LMS)**: Acts as the middleware handling the logic and processing of the member's request, including finding related books and their locations.
4. **Database**: The storage system that contains all the data about books, including details, shelf numbers, and information for locating related books.

The flow starts with the member entering a unique ID on the search interface, which sends this query to the Library Management System (LMS). The LMS then queries the database for the book's details and, upon finding the book, looks for related books based on predefined criteria (e.g., same author, genre, etc.). The database returns the details of the related books along with their shelf numbers. Finally, the LMS sends this information back to the interface, which displays it to the member.

Remember, this is a simplified example. Real-world implementations may involve more complex interactions, especially when dealing with large volumes of data, and may include error handling mechanisms, user authentication, and interactions with other systems for notifications or recommendations.

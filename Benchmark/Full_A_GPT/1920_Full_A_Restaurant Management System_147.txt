Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story "As a manager, I want to generate reports every week and month" necessitates illustrating the interactions between the restaurant manager and the Restaurant Management and Operations System, specifically focusing on the report generation functionality.

Here is a PlantUML code snippet to represent this sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as managementUI
participant "Reporting Module" as reportingModule
database "Database" as db

manager -> managementUI: Access Reporting Section
activate managementUI
managementUI -> reportingModule: Request Report Generation Options
activate reportingModule

reportingModule -> db: Query Required Data
activate db
db -> reportingModule: Return Queried Data
deactivate db

reportingModule -> reportingModule: Process Data for Reports
reportingModule -> managementUI: Display Report Types (Weekly, Monthly)
managementUI -> manager: Choose Report Type (Weekly/Monthly)
manager -> managementUI: Select Weekly Report
managementUI -> reportingModule: Generate Weekly Report

reportingModule -> db: Fetch Weekly Data
activate db
db -> reportingModule: Return Weekly Data
deactivate db

reportingModule -> reportingModule: Compile Weekly Report
reportingModule -> managementUI: Display Weekly Report
managementUI -> manager: Show Weekly Report
deactivate managementUI

manager -> managementUI: Request Monthly Report
activate managementUI
managementUI -> reportingModule: Generate Monthly Report
activate reportingHelmetModule

reportingModule -> db: Fetch Monthly Data
activate db
db -> reportingModule: Return Monthly Data
deactivate db

reportingModule -> reportingModule: Compile Monthly Report
reportingModule -> managementUI: Display Monthly Report
managementUI -> manager: Show Monthly Report

deactivate reportingModule
deactivate managementUI

### Explanation:
1. **Manager Interaction**: The sequence begins with the manager accessing the reporting section through the Management Interface.
2. **Report Option Request**: The Management Interface requests the Reporting Module to display available report generation options.
3. **Data Query and Processing**: The Reporting Module interacts with the Database to fetch the needed data, processes it, and prompts the manager to select either a weekly or monthly report.
4. **Report Generation**: Upon the manager's selection, the Reporting Module fetches the relevant data (weekly or monthly), compiles the report, and returns it to the Management Interface, which then displays it to the manager.
5. **Report Display**: The manager reviews the generated reports as provided by the Management Interface.

This sequence captures the essential steps a manager would undertake to generate weekly and monthly reports using the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Adjustments can be made to the diagram to reflect additional complexities or specific technological implementations as needed.

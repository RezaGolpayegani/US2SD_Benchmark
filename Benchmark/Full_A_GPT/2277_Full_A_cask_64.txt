Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates the detailed process for a user disabling the explore feature for a dataset that was initially configured for exploration.

Please note: The diagram represents a simplified interaction flow and assumes there is an existing system or API to interact with datasets, environments for dataset exploration (such as a web interface or CLI), authorization mechanisms, and underlying mechanisms for marking a dataset as non-explorable. It focuses on the high-level interaction without diving into the specifics of the dataset management system's internal implementation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "API Gateway" as api
participant "Authorization Service" as auth
participant "Dataset Management" as dm
participant "Explore Service" as es

== Disable Dataset Explore Feature ==
user -> web: Select dataset to update
web -> user: Display dataset details

user -> web: Request to disable explore
web -> api: API call to disable explore for dataset
api -> auth: Validate user permission
auth --> api: Permission granted

api -> dm: Request dataset update
dm -> es: Disable explore for specified dataset
es --> dm: Explore disabled
dm --> api: Update confirmation
api --> web: Display success message
web --> user: Explore disabled successfully

Explanation of steps in the Diagram:

1. **User Interaction**: The user selects the dataset they wish to update through a web interface and requests to disable the explore feature.
2. **API Call**: The web interface makes an API call to perform the operation.
3. **Authorization**: The API gateway checks with the Authorization Service to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to update the dataset settings.
4. **Update Process**: Once authorized, the request is forwarded to the Dataset Management system to handle the disablement of the explore feature for the selected dataset.
5. **Disabling Explore**: The Dataset Management system interacts with the Explore Service to effectively disable exploration capabilities for the specified dataset.
6. **Confirmation**: Upon successful update, a confirmation is sent back through the chain to the user indicating that the explore feature has been successfully disabled.

This diagram encapsulates the essential interactions while abstracting away the finer details specific to the underlying data store and implementation technologies. It provides a clear visualization of the sequence of actions that need to be performed to disable dataset exploration based on the requirements laid out in the project description provided.

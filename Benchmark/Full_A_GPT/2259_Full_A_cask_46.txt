Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story involves depicting the interactions between system components and the user when the latter wants to view the properties used to configure a dataset instance. Given the complexity of the described system, the following is a simplified representation focusing on key elements such as the User, UI, Dataset Management System (DMS), and Dataset Instance.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant UI
participant DMS
participant DatasetInstance

User -> UI: Request dataset instance properties
UI -> DMS: Fetch properties for dataset instance
DMS -> DatasetInstance: Retrieve configuration details
DatasetInstance -> DMS: Return properties
DMS -> UI: Display dataset properties
UI -> User: Show dataset instance properties

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the User requesting to see the properties of a dataset instance through the UI. The UI then communicates this request to the Dataset Management System (DMS). The DMS queries the specific Dataset Instance for its configuration details. The Dataset Instance returns these properties to the DMS, which subsequently passes the information back to the UI. Finally, the UI presents the dataset instance properties to the User.

This diagram assumes a direct, synchronous communication pattern for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, the interactions may involve more complex mechanisms such as API calls, event-driven data flows, or asynchronous responses, especially in distributed environments. Additionally, this high-level overview may be expanded with detailed interactions, such as authentication and authorization, error handling, and data formatting.

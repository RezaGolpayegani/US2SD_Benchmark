To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided, we'll need to consider the main interactions between the site admin and the platform's system components when editing and deleting help wanted ads. Below is a PlantUML format sequence diagram illustrating these interactions.

Please note, to compile this code into a visual diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML-compatible tool or online service.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin as "Site Admin"
participant "Admin Interface" as AdminInterface
participant "Ad Management System" as AdSystem
participant "Database" as DB

== Edit Help Wanted Ad ==
Admin -> AdminInterface: Accesses Help Wanted Ads section
AdminInterface -> AdSystem: Fetches selected ad details
AdSystem -> DB: Query ad details
DB --> AdSystem: Returns ad details
AdSystem --> AdminInterface: Shows ad details
AdminInterface --> Admin: Displays ad information

Admin -> AdminInterface: Submits edited ad details
AdminInterface -> AdSystem: Request ad update
AdSystem -> DB: Update ad details in database
DB --> AdSystem: Confirm ad update
AdSystem --> AdminInterface: Update confirmation
AdminInterface --> Admin: Shows update success message

== Delete Help Wanted Ad ==
Admin -> AdminInterface: Requests to delete an ad
AdminInterface -> AdSystem: Send delete ad request
AdSystem -> DB: Deletes ad from database
DB --> AdSystem: Confirm deletion
AdSystem --> AdminInterface: Deletion confirmation
AdminInterface --> Admin: Shows deletion success message

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. **Edit Help Wanted Ad:**
   - The site admin accesses the help wanted ads section.
   - The admin selects an ad to edit, and the system fetches and displays the ad details.
   - The admin submits the edited ad details.
   - The system updates the ad in the database and confirms the update to the admin.

2. **Delete Help Wanted Ad:**
   - The site admin requests to delete a specific ad.
   - The system processes this request and deletes the ad from the database.
   - After deletion, the system confirms the successful removal of the ad to the admin.

This diagram provides a structured view of the process involved in editing and deleting help wanted ads from the perspective of a site admin, focusing on the interactions between the admin, the admin interface, the ad management system, and the database.

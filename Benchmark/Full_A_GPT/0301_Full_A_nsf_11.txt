Given your request, below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a content editor, I want to be able to easily find content, so that I can edit it." This scenario involves interaction with a content management system (CMS) where the content editor searches and finds content for editing within the NSF Beta Site Development context.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ContentEditor as "Content Editor"
participant SearchInterface as "CMS Search Interface"
database CMSDatabase as "CMS Database"
participant ContentPage as "Content Page"

ContentEditor -> SearchInterface : enters search query\n(keywords/tags)
activate SearchInterface

SearchInterface -> CMSDatabase : query for content
activate CMSDatabase

CMSDatabase --> SearchInterface : search results
deactivate CMSDatabase

SearchInterface --> ContentEditor : display search results
deactivate SearchInterface

ContentEditor -> SearchInterface : select content from results
activate SearchInterface

SearchInterface -> CMSDatabase : request selected content
activate CMSDatabase

CMSDatabase --> SearchInterface : retrieve content details
deactivate CMSDatabase

SearchInterface --> ContentPage : display content in editor
deactivate SearchInterface
activate ContentPage

ContentEditor -> ContentPage : edits content
ContentPage --> CMSDatabase : save changes
activate CMSDatabase

CMSDatabase --> ContentPage : confirm changes saved
deactivate CMSDatabase

ContentEditor <-- ContentPage : display confirmation\n(edit successful)
deactivate ContentPage

This PlantUML sequence diagram describes the series of interactions between a content editor and the content management system, starting from entering a search query to editing and saving changes to content within the NSF Beta Site's CMS. The steps are broadly as follows:

1. **Content Editor inputs a search query**: The editor uses the CMS Search Interface to find specific content by entering keywords or tags.

2. **CMS Search Interface queries the CMS Database**: The search interface queries the CMS Database with the input from the content editor.

3. **CMS Database returns search results**: The database retrieves and returns the search results to the CMS Search Interface, which in turn displays them to the content editor.

4. **Content Editor selects content to edit**: From the displayed search results, the editor selects the content they want to edit.

5. **CMS Search Interface requests and retrieves content details**: The interface requests the selected contentâ€™s details from the CMS Database and retrieves them.

6. **Content Editor edits the content**: The selected content is displayed in the Content Editor / Page, where the editor makes the desired changes.

7. **Content Page saves changes to the CMS Database**: The edited content is then saved back to the database.

8. **CMS Database confirms the changes**: The database confirms that the changes have been successfully saved.

9. **Content Editor receives confirmation of successful edit**: Finally, the content editor receives a confirmation message that the edit was successful, confirming the completion of the process.

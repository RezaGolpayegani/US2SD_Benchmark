Creating a detailed sequence diagram for incorporating Bootstrap into the development process of the RecycleSmart Platform involves capturing the sequence of interactions between the developer, the Bootstrap framework, and the web application. Below is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram that represents these interactions.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Developer 
participant "Bootstrap CDN" as CDN
participant "RecycleSmart Web Application" as WebApp

== Initialize Bootstrap Integration ==
Developer -> CDN : Search for Bootstrap latest version URL
activate CDN
CDN --> Developer : Return Bootstrap URL
deactivate CDN

Developer -> WebApp : Include Bootstrap link in <head>
activate WebApp
WebApp --> Developer : Confirm Bootstrap integration
deactivate WebApp

== Use Bootstrap for UI Development ==
loop While Developing UI
    Developer -> WebApp : Apply Bootstrap classes to HTML
    activate WebApp
    WebApp --> Developer : Display updated UI
    deactivate WebApp
end

== Testing Responsive Design ==
Developer -> WebApp : Test responsiveness on different devices
activate WebApp
WebApp --> Developer : Show responsive design feedback
deactivate WebApp

This sequence diagram begins with the developer searching for the latest Bootstrap version URL from the Bootstrap Content Delivery Network (CDN). Upon receiving the URL, the developer includes the Bootstrap link in the head section of the RecycleSmart web application's HTML code, which confirms the integration of Bootstrap. As the development progresses, the developer applies Bootstrap classes to HTML elements iteratively to improve the user interface (UI). Finally, the developer tests the responsive design of the application on different devices to ensure a seamless user experience across all platforms. 

Remember, this is a simplified overview. The actual integration can involve more detailed steps based on the specific requirements of the RecycleSmart platform, such as customizing Bootstrap variables, using JavaScript components, and so on.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to comment about books" using PlantUML syntax requires breaking down the operation into several interactions between components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Here's a general sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax illustrating the process from when the user decides to comment on a book until the comment is successfully stored and acknowledged.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant UserInterface as UI
participant AuthenticationService as Auth
participant CommentService as CS
participant Database as DB

actor User

User -> UI : Selects Book to Comment
UI -> Auth : Authenticate User
Auth --> UI : Authentication Success

User -> UI : Write Comment
UI -> CS : Send Comment Data {"userId", "bookId", "comment"}

CS -> Auth : Verify User ID
Auth --> CS : Verification Success

CS -> DB : Save Comment
DB --> CS : Comment Saved Successfully

CS --> UI : Display Success Message
UI -> User : Show "Comment Added Successfully"

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **User Interaction**: The process starts when the user selects a book they wish to comment on and writes their comment.

2. **Authentication**: Before the comment can be processed, the user needs to be authenticated (which is why the sequence includes an interaction with an `AuthenticationService`). This step ensures that only valid, logged-in users can post comments.

3. **Comment Submission**: Once authenticated, the user's comment, along with their user ID and the bookâ€™s ID, is sent to the `CommentService`.

4. **Verification**: The `CommentService` may interact with the `AuthenticationService` again to verify the user's ID as an additional security measure.

5. **Saving Comment**: The `CommentService` then instructs the `Database` to save the comment. The database confirms that the comment has been saved successfully.

6. **Feedback to User**: Finally, the `CommentService` sends a message back to the user interface, which prompts a success message to the user, indicating that their comment has been added successfully.

This diagram provides a general sequence of operations for the user story in question. It's important to note that the actual implementation could involve more steps or different services, especially in a system as comprehensive as the CLMS. This sequence diagram focuses on the core interactions relevant to adding a comment on a book.

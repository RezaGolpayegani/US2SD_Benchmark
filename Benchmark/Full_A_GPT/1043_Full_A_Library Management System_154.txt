Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interaction between the library member (user), the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the backend components such as the database. This scenario covers checking book availability and reserving a book if available.

Here's how the PlantUML syntax for this sequence diagram could look:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember as member
participant "CLMS Interface" as interface
participant "Book Management" as books
database "Database" as db

== Check Book Availability ==
member -> interface : Enter search criteria for book
interface -> books : Query book availability
books -> db : Check availability (title, author, etc.)
db --> books : Book availability details
books --> interface : Show book availability
interface --> member : Display book availability

== Reserve Book ==
member -> interface : Requests to reserve book
interface -> books : Initiate reservation process
books -> db : Create reservation record
db --> books : Reservation confirmation
books --> interface : Reservation success message
interface --> member : Display reservation confirmation

@enduml
```

This PlantUML script details the following sequence:
1. **Check Book Availability:**
   - The library member searches for a book through the CLMS interface by entering search criteria such as title, author, or category.
   - The CLMS interface forwards the query to the Book Management system.
   - The Book Management system searches for the requested information in the database.
   - The database returns the book availability details to the Book Management system.
   - The Book Management system sends the availability details back to the CLMS interface.
   - The CLMS interface displays the book availability information to the library member.

2. **Reserve Book:**
   - The library member requests to reserve the book through the CLMS interface.
   - The CLMS interface initiates the reservation process in the Book Management system.
   - The Book Management system creates a reservation record in the database for the library member.
   - The database confirms the reservation to the Book Management system.
   - The Book Management system sends a reservation success message to the CLMS interface.
   - The CLMS interface displays a reservation confirmation message to the library member.

This sequence diagram offers a simplified view of the processes involved in checking the availability of a book and reserving it through the Comprehensive Library Management System.

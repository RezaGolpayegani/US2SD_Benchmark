Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to look up books by title" using PlantUML syntax involves showing the interactions between the user (Library Member), the system's front end (Library Management System Interface), and the backend components (SearchController, Database) that facilitate the book lookup process. Below is how the PlantUML sequence diagram code might look:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as M
participant "Library Management\nSystem Interface" as UI
participant "SearchController" as SC
database "Database" as DB

M -> UI : Enter book title
UI -> SC : Request book search by title
activate SC
SC -> DB : Query books by title
activate DB
DB --> SC : Return search results
deactivate DB
SC --> UI : Display search results
deactivate SC
UI --> M : Show book titles and details
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram breaks down the process as follows:

1. **Member (Library User) Interaction**:
   - The member starts the interaction by entering the book title into the Library Management System Interface. This can be achieved through a search bar or a dedicated search page within the CLMS.

2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**:
   - The Library Management System Interface sends the member's search request to the SearchController, which is responsible for handling search queries.

3. **Search Process in Backend**:
   - The SearchController receives the request to search books by title. It then formulates and executes a database query to search for books with titles matching the member's input.

4. **Database Interaction**:
   - The Database processes the query received from the SearchController and retrieves a list of books that match the search criteria. These results include book titles, and could also contain additional details like author, availability, and location within the library.

5. **Result Display**:
   - The database sends the search results back to the SearchController, which in turn sends this information back to the Library Management System Interface.

6. **Member Views Results**:
   - Finally, the Library Management System Interface displays the search results to the member. This display includes the book titles and possibly additional information, allowing the member to select a book or refine their search further.

This sequence diagram outlines the fundamental interactions involved in looking up books by title within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), from the user initiating the search to displaying the search results via the system's frontend and backend components.

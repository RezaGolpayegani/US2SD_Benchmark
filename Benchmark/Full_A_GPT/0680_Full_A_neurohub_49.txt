Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to download files directly from the search results page" involves depicting the interaction between the user, the system interface, and the backend services that facilitate the file download process. This sequence diagram will utilize PlantUML syntax, which can be executed in a PlantUML environment to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Search UI" as UI
participant "Search Controller" as Controller
participant "File Service" as FileService
participant "Data Repository" as Repository

User -> UI: Enter search criteria
UI -> Controller: Send search request
Controller -> Repository: Query data
Repository --> Controller: Return search results
Controller --> UI: Display search results

User -> UI: Select file(s) for download
UI -> Controller: Request file download
Controller -> FileState: Validate download request

alt If file is available and user has permission
    FileState -> Repository: Request file location
    Repository --> FileState: Return file location
    FileState --> Controller: Confirm file ready for download
    Controller -> FileService: Initiate file download
    FileService -> Repository: Access file
    Repository --> FileService: Transfer file data
    FileService --> User: Download file(s)
else If file is unavailable or user lacks permission
    Controller --> UI: Show error message
end

This sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step process when a user wants to download files directly from the search results page. The process starts with the user entering a search query, which is processed by the system to display the pertinent files. Upon selecting the file(s) for download, the system checks for file availability and user permissions. If the file is available and the user has the necessary permissions, the download process is initiated; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

To visualize this diagram, you would need to input the PlantUML code into a PlantUML-compatible viewer or tool.

Note: The participant "FileState" in the diagram is an intermediary representation and not an actual component; it symbolizes the process checking for file availability and user permissions which might involve complex interactions within the "Search Controller" or separate authorization services, depending on the precise architecture of the Neurohub platform. Adjust the participant name and interactions as per your specific implementation details or architectural design.

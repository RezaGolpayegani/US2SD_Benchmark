Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that depicts the process for an authenticated user to view and pay for their individual sponsorships as the third step of the registration process. This diagram outlines the interactions between the user, the platform's front-end interface, and the necessary back-end systems involved in the process, including authentication checks, sponsorship details retrieval, and payment processing.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AuthenticatedUser as User
participant "Front-end Interface" as FE
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Sponsorship Management System" as SMS
participant "Payment Gateway" as PG

User -> FE: Access Sponsorship Registration
FE -> Auth: Validate User Session
Auth --> FE: Session Valid
FE -> SMS: Request Sponsorship Details
SMS --> FE: Display Sponsorship Options
User -> FE: Select Sponsorship Package
FE -> FE: Display Payment Page with Selected Package
User -> FE: Enter Payment Details
FE -> PG: Process Payment with Details
PG --> FE: Payment Successful
FE -> SMS: Update Sponsorship Status
SMS --> FE: Confirmation & Receipt
FE --> User: Display Confirmation & Receipt

This sequence diagram starts with the user accessing the sponsorship registration section on the platform's interface. The system then validates the user's session to ensure they are authenticated. After authentication, the user requests to view the sponsorship options available, and the system retrieves and displays these details.

Upon selecting a sponsorship package, the user is directed to the payment page where they input their payment information. The front-end interface then communicates with the payment gateway to process the transaction. Assuming the payment is successful, the system updates the sponsorship status accordingly and provides the user with a confirmation and receipt of their sponsorship.

Please note, this diagram assumes that each interaction leads to a successful outcome (e.g., session validation is successful, payment is processed without issues). In a real-world implementation, additional steps should be considered to handle errors or unsuccessful actions (such as failed payment processing).

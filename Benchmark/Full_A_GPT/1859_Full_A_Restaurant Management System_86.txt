Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a management user, I want to see the number of orders by neighborhood" encompasses several interactions between different system components. Here's a Plant UML description that captures the main interactions required to fulfill this user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Management User" as User
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Analytics Module" as Analytics

User -> Web : Request orders by neighborhood
Web -> Server : Fetch orders by neighborhood
Server -> DB : Query orders grouped by neighborhood
DB -> Server : Return orders data
Server -> Analytics : Process data for analytics
Analytics -> Server : Return processed data (number of orders by neighborhood)
Server -> Web : Display orders by neighborhood data
Web -> User : Show data visualization

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. The management user initiates a request to see the number of orders by neighborhood through the web interface.
2. The web interface forwards this request to the server to fetch the required data.
3. The server queries the database for orders, requesting them to be grouped by neighborhood to understand the distribution of orders.
4. The database returns the raw orders data to the server.
5. The server then sends this data to an analytics module designed to process and analyze the data, specifically to calculate the number of orders per neighborhood.
6. The analytics module processes this data and returns the structured data (i.e., the count of orders by neighborhood) back to the server.
7. The server sends this processed data back to the web interface.
8. Finally, the web interface displays this data to the management user, likely in some form of data visualization like charts or graphs for easy understanding.

This diagram simplifies the interactions and focuses on the main components involved in fulfilling the user's request. In a real-world scenario, additional steps or different technologies might be involved, especially for large datasets or complex analytics.

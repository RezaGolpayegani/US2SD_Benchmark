Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a reader, I want to comment on books" involves several steps and components interacting with each other in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Below is a PlantUML code that outlines this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Reader as R
participant FrontendInterface as FI
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

R -> FI : Navigate to book detail page
FI -> BS : Request book information
BS -> DB : Query book details
DB -> BS : Return book details
BS -> FI : Display book information to Reader
R -> FI : Enter comment in comment section
FI -> BS : Submit comment
BS -> DB : Save comment to book's record
DB --> BS : Confirm comment saved
BS --> FI : Display success message
FI --> R : Show confirmation message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows these steps:

1. The **Reader** navigates to the book detail page through the **Frontend Interface**.
2. The **Frontend Interface** requests book information from the **Backend Server**.
3. The **Backend Server** queries the **Database** for the book's details.
4. The **Database** returns the book's details to the **Backend Server**.
5. The **Backend Server** sends the book information to the **Frontend Interface**, which displays it to the **Reader**.
6. The **Reader** enters a comment in the comment section provided on the book's detail page.
7. The comment is submitted to the **Backend Server** through the **Fronted Interface**.
8. The **Backend Server** saves the comment to the book's record in the **Database**.
9. The **Database** confirms that the comment is saved.
10. The **Backend Server** sends a success message to the **Frontend Interface**.
11. The **Frontend Interface** displays a confirmation message to the **Reader** indicating that the comment has been posted successfully.

This sequence ensures that the reader’s interaction—from viewing the book details to posting a comment—is handled smoothly, reflecting the interactions among the system's components to support this feature.

To design a detailed sequence diagram for your user story in PlantUML format, we'll outline the sequence of actions a researcher would take to create a logbook page for an experiment and attach a directory that contains multiple files. This sequence includes interactions between the researcher, the Neurohub platform's user interface, and the backend services responsible for processing the request and managing data storage.

Below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "UI: Neurohub Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as Backend
participant "Data Storage" as Storage

Researcher -> UI: Navigate to 'Create Logbook Page'
UI -> Backend: Request page creation form
activate Backend
Backend -> UI: Return page creation form
deactivate Backend
UI -> Researcher: Display page creation form

Researcher -> UI: Fill form and attach directory
activate UI
UI -> Backend: Submit form data and directory path
activate Backend

Backend -> Storage: Create logbook page entry
activate Storage
Storage --> Backend: Confirm logbook page creation
deactivate Storage

Backend -> Storage: Initiate directory file attachment process
activate Storage
Storage --> Backend: Confirm files attached
deactivate Storage

Backend --> UI: Confirm page creation and file attachment
deactivate Backend
UI --> Researcher: Display confirmation message
deactivate UI

This diagram details the interaction flow starting from the researcher's intention to create a new logbook page up until the confirmation of the action, including all the key players: the researcher, the Neurohub interface, the backend service, and the data storage systems. 

Each step in the sequence is crucial for understanding how the system functions as a whole from the user's action to the system's response. Additional complexities, such as error handling and data validation, can be added for a more detailed representation depending on the requirements of your project.

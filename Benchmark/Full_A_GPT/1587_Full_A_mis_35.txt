Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the "Auditing & Reporting" part of your Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) project requires highlighting the interactions between various system components and actors for audit and report generation functionalities. Note that the following PlantUML code is a conceptual starting point and might need adjustments to fit the specific technologies and complexities of your EDRMS project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Repoadmin
participant "Audit & Reporting Service" as ARS
database "EDRMS Database" as DB
participant "Report Generator" as RG
participant "Audit Log" as AL
participant "Email Service" as ES

Repoadmin -> ARS: Request Audit Report
ARS -> DB: Query Audit Data
DB --> ARS: Audit Data
ARS -> RG: Generate Report(Audit Data)
RG --> ARS: Audit Report
ARS -> AL: Log Report Request
ARS --> Repoadmin: Audit Report

== Error Log Reporting ==
Repoadren -> ARS: Request Error Logs
ARS -> DB: Query Error Logs
DB --> ARS: Error Log Data
ARS -> RG: Generate Report(Error Log Data)
RG --> ARS: Error Logs Report
ARS -> AL: Log Error Request
ARS --> Repoadmn: Error Logs Report

== Subscription-Based Notifications ==
Repoadmin -> ARS: Subscribe to Reports
ARS -> AL: Log Subscription
ARS -> ES: Setup Subscription
note right of ES: Triggered by Report Generation\nor Specific Events
ES -> Repoadmin: Send Report via Email

This sequence diagram starts with the Repoadmin requesting an audit report. The "Audit & Reporting Service" (ARS) queries the EDRMS Database for audit data, which is then passed to a "Report Generator" to produce the actual report. The action of generating and delivering this report is logged in an "Audit Log." The sequence diagram also covers error log reporting and setting up subscription-based notifications for such reports.

### Key Components Explained:

- **Repoadmin:** Represents repository administrators or other users with the authority to request reports and audits.

- **Audit & Reporting Service (ARS):** Central hub that handles all requests related to auditing and reporting, including fetching data, generating reports, and managing subscriptions.

- **EDRMS Database:** Stores all data, including audit logs, error logs, and any other data that needs to be reported or audited.

- **Report Generator:** Service component that takes raw data (like audit logs) and transforms it into a structured report.

- **Audit Log:** Specialized database or service component that records actions taken within the system, especially those related to audit and reporting.

- **Email Service:** Manages sending of reports, alerts, and notifications to subscribed administrators or users.

### Important Notes:

- This diagram is a simplified model; you may need to extend or adapt it based on your specific requirements, including the complexity of your audit and reporting needs and the technical architecture of your EDRMS.
- The sequence for querying error logs and sending email notifications hints at additional use cases beyond simple audit reports.
- PlantUML code can be further detailed by incorporating alternative flows, conditions, and loop mechanisms to handle complex scenarios, such as handling errors in report generation or email sending failures.

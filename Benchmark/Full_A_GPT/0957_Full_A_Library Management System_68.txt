Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves depicting the interactions between different system components and actors to accomplish the task of notifying a librarian when books become available. In the context of the Comprehensive Library Management Â©System (CLMS), this involves interactions between librarians, the library management system, and potentially other entities such as the database or notification services.

Below is a basic representation of how the interactions could be structured in PlantUML format. This example assumes that the librarian initiates a query to check the availability of a book, and the system either directly informs the librarian of the book's availability or sets up an alert for future availability notifications.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Business Logic" as Logic
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Notification Service" as Notify

Librarian -> Interface: Check availability (Book ID)
activate Interface
Interface -> Logic: Query availability (Book ID)
activate Logic
Logic -> DB: Request book status (Book ID)
activate DB
DB --> Logic: Book unavailable
deactivate DB

Logic --> Interface: Book unavailable, set alert?
deactivate Logic
Interface --> Librarian: Book unavailable, set alert?
deactivate Interface
Librarian -> Interface: Set availability alert
activate Interface
Interface -> Logic: Create alert for (Book ID)
activate Logic
Logic -> DB: Register alert (Book ID, Librarian ID)
activate DB
DB --> Logic: Alert registered
deactivate DB
Logic --> Interface: Alert set successfully
deactivate Logic
Interface --> Librarian: Alert confirmation
deactivate Interface

... Time passes, book becomes available ...

DB -> Notify: Trigger alert (Book ID is available)
activate Notify
Notify -> Interface: Notify librarian (Book ID is available)
activate Interface
Interface -> Logic: Process notification (Book ID, Librarian ID)
activate Logic
Logic -> DB: Update book status (Book ID, Available)
activate DB
DB --> Logic: Status updated
deactivate DB
Logic --> Interface: Prepare notification message
deactivate Logic
Interface --> Librarian: Book (Book ID) is now available
deactivate Interface
deactivate Notify

This sequence diagram starts with the Librarian checking for the availability of a book through the CLMS interface. The system processes this request, and upon finding the book unavailable, offers the option to set an alert. Upon the Librarian's confirmation, the system registers this alert in the database.

Later, when the book becomes available, the system's notification service is triggered, leading to a series of interactions that ultimately notify the Librarian that the book is now available for borrowing.

Please note, this diagram makes a few assumptions about the system's internal workings and interactions, and it can be further detailed or modified depending on specific implementation choices, such as direct librarian-to-database interactions, the use of external notification services, or additional steps in the book's availability checking process.

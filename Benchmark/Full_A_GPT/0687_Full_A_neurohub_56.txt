Given the context of your request, below is a PlantUML representation to detail the sequence diagram for the user story of migrating data from an older version of NeuroHub to the current version, from a system administrator's perspective. This sequence includes basic steps like starting the migration process, validation, and the actual migration actions. This is a conceptual representation and further details or steps may be needed based on the specific technical implementation details of NeuroHub.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "System Administrator" as Admin
participant "Old NeuroHub" as OldHub
participant "Migration Tool" as MigrationTool
participant "Current NeuroHub" as NewHub

Admin -> MigrationTool: Initiate migration process
activate MigrationTool

MigrationTool -> OldHub: Validate version compatibility
activate OldHub
OldHub --> MigrationTool: Validation result
deactivate OldHub
alt if compatible

  MigrationTool -> OldHub: Extract data & metadata
  activate OldHub
  OldHub --> MigrationTool: Data & metadata
  deactivate OldHub

  MigrationTool -> NewHub: Transform data & metadata (if necessary)
  activate MigrationTool
  deactivate MigrationTool

  MigrationTool -> NewHub: Import data & metadata
  activate NewHub
  NewHub --> MigrationTool: Confirmation of import
  deactivate NewField

  MigrationTool --> Admin: Migration success message
else not compatible

  MigrationTool --> Admin: Error message (incompatibility)
end

deactivate MigrationTool
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initiate Migration Process:** The system administrator initiates the migration process via the Migration Tool.

2. **Validate Version Compatibility:** The Migration Tool checks if the old NeuroHub version is compatible with the migration process.

3. **Data Extraction & Transformation:**
   - If compatible, the Migration Tool extracts data and metadata from the old NeuroHub.
   - It then transforms the data and metadata if necessary to suit the format or requirements of the current version of NeuroHub.

4. **Data Import:** The transformed data and metadata are then imported into the current NeuroHub.

5. **Confirmation & Feedback:** Upon successful import, the Migration Tool provides feedback to the system administrator about the success of the migration.

6. **Error Handling:** If the old and new versions are not compatible, the Migration Tool sends an error message to the system administrator.

This sequence diagram illustrates a high-level view and some steps may be abstracted for simplicity. Depending on the implementation details of NeuroHub, additional steps like backup creation, detailed validation reports, or post-migration verification might be necessary.

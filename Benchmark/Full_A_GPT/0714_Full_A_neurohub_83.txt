Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML requires a structured approach to outlining how the system will handle automatic metadata insertion when new data is added by a researcher. Below is a PlantUML code that visualizes this process. This sequence diagram involves interactions among components such as the Researcher, Frontend UI, Metadata Service, Database, and an External Metadata Source (if applicable).

Please note, this is a generalized example focusing on the key steps involved in the process as described in the user story. Specific implementations might require additional steps or services.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Researcher as researcher
participant "Frontend UI" as frontend
participant "Metadata Service" as metadataService
participant "Database" as database
participant "External Metadata Source\n(optional)" as externalMetadata

== Data Addition and Metadata Insertion Process ==

researcher -> frontend : Uploads new data
activate frontend

frontend -> metadataService : Request metadata generation
activate metadataService

metadataService -> externalMetadata : Fetch predefined metadata
activate externalMetadata
externalLib -> metadataService : Return metadata

metadataService -> database : Insert automatic metadata
activate database
database --> metadataService : Acknowledge insertion
deactivate database

metadataService --> frontend : Confirm metadata added
deactivate metadataService

frontend --> researcher : Notify data and metadata addition successful
deactivate frontend

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Researcher Uploads New Data**: The process begins when a researcher uploads new data to the system through the Frontend UI.
2. **Request Metadata Generation**: The Frontend UI then requests the Metadata Service to generate or fetch the necessary metadata.
3. **Fetch Predefined Metadata (Optional)**: The Metadata Service may reach out to an External Metadata Source, if applicable, to fetch predefined metadata templates or information.
4. **Insert Automatic Metadata**: The Metadata Service then proceeds to insert this automatic metadata into the Database.
5. **Acknowledge Insertion**: The Database acknowledges the successful insertion of the metadata.
6. **Confirm Metadata Added**: The Metadata Service confirms to the Frontend UI that the metadata has been successfully added.
7. **Notify Data and Metadata Addition Successful**: Finally, the Frontend UI notifies the researcher that both their data and the metadata have been successfully added to the system.

This sequence aims to illustrate a generalized process for automatic metadata insertion associated with new data additions by a researcher. Adjustments may be needed to align with the specific technologies, protocols, and requirements of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project.

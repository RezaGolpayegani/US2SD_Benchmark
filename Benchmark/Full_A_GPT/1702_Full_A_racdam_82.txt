To visualize how a researcher would interact with a system to view film clips within the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project, we can break down the process into different steps and represent these interactions using a sequence diagram. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that describes the interaction between the researcher (user), the system's interface, and backend services necessary to fulfill this user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as user
participant "Search Interface" as search
participant "Authorization Service" as auth
participant "File Management System" as fileManager
participant "Media Streaming Service" as mediaStream

== User Requests Film Clips ==
user -> search : Enter search keywords
search -> fileManager : Retrieve matching files
fileManager --> search : Return film clip metadata
search --> user : Display film clip options

== User Selects a Film Clip ==
user -> search : Select specific film clip
search -> auth : Check user permissions
auth --> search : Permission granted

== Streaming Film Clip ==
search -> fileManager : Request film clip access
fileManager -> mediaStream : Fetch film clip
mediaStream --> fileManager : Stream film clip
fileManager --> user : Display film player UI
user -> mediaPlayer : Interacts with player controls

### Explanation:

1. **Researcher Inputs Search Keywords**: The user (researcher) starts by entering search keywords into the Search Interface, aiming to find relevant film clips.

2. **Search Interface Retrieves Matches**: The Search Interface communicates with the File Management System to retrieve files that match the search criteria, returning metadata about potential film clips to the user.

3. **User Selects Film Clip**: Based on the options provided, the researcher chooses a specific film clip they wish to view. The Search Interface then requests permission from the Authorization Service to access the selected film clip.

4. **Authorization Granted**: The Authorization Service checks the user's permissions and, if authorized, grants access to the film clip.

5. **Streaming Service Fetches Film Clip**: The File Management System requests the actual film clip from the Media Streaming Service based on the authorization.

6. **User Views Film Clip**: The Media Streaming Service streams the film clip back through the File Management System to the user, displaying it within a film player UI. The researcher can then interact with the player controls (play, pause, rewind, etc.).

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the researcher and the Digital Archive Management System's components for viewing film clips, emphasizing search, authorization, file management, and media streaming functionalities.

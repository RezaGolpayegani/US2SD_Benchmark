Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the user and the system's components for specifying a dataset schema as a SQL schema string. Here is a high-level sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax that illustrates these interactions, assuming a basic flow where the user interacts with a UI that communicates with the backend system, which in turn updates the dataset configuration.

```
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant ApiService as API
participant SchemaService as Schema
participant DatasetConfig as Config
participant Database as DB

title Specify Dataset Schema as SQL String Workflow

User -> UI : Enter SQL schema string
activate UI

UI -> API : Request to update schema (SQL string)
activate API

API -> Schema : Validate SQL schema
activate Schema

alt If SQL schema is valid
    Schema -> Config : Update dataset configuration
    activate Config
    Config -> DB : Store updated config
    activate DB
    DB --> Config : Acknowledge storage
    deactivate DB
    Config --> Schema : Configuration updated
    deactivate Config
    Schema --> API : Schema valid and updated
else If SQL schema is invalid
    Schema --> API : Error: Invalid schema
end
deactivate Schema

alt If update successful
    API --> UI : Display success message
else If update fails
    API --> UI : Display error message
end
deactivate API

User <-- UI : See result of operation
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

In the above diagram, the flow is initiated when the user enters and submits a SQL schema string through the User Interface (UI). The UI sends this data to the ApiService (API), which in turn requests validation from the SchemaService (Schema). If the schema is valid, SchemaService instructs the DatasetConfig (Config) to update the dataset's configuration. The updated configuration is then stored in the Database (DB). Depending on the outcome, the user is then notified of either success or an error through the UI.

This diagram represents a simplified sequence of operations for updating a dataset schema with a SQL string. You may need to adjust namespaces, component names, and details based on the exact architecture and design of your dataset management and version control system.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a UI designer, I want to move on to round 2 of Homepage edits, so that I can get approval from leadership" in PlantUML format involves outlining the sequence of events that take place from starting the second round of Homepage edits to receiving approval from leadership.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "UI Designer" as designer
participant "Design Tool" as tool
participant "Version Control System" as vcs
participant "Project Management Tool" as pmt
participant "Approval System" as approvalSys
participant "Leadership Team" as leadership

== Start Round 2 of Homepage Edits ==
designer -> tool : Start editing homepage
note right of designer : Incorporates feedback\nfrom Round 1
designer -> tool : Finalize edits

== Submit Edits to Version Control ==
designer -> vcs : Commit edits
note right of vcs : Includes description\nand version tagging

== Update Project Status ==
designer -> pmt : Update task status\n"Round 2 Edits Submitted"
pmt --> designer : Confirmation

== Initiate Approval Process ==
designer -> approvalSys : Request approval\nfor Round 2 Edits
loop Each Leadership Member
    approvalSys -> leadership : Send approval request

This diagram visually represents the flow from beginning the second round of homepage edits as a UI Designer to ultimately receiving approval (or feedback) from the leadership team. First, the designer works on the design tool to incorporate feedback and finalize edits. Once done, these edits are committed to a version control system with descriptive comments and version tagging. 

Subsequently, the designer updates the projectâ€™s status in a project management tool to signal that the round 2 edits have been submitted. Following this, an approval process is initiated through an approval system designed to collect feedback from the leadership team. Each member reviews the changes and either approves or rejects them. Based on this collective feedback, the designer is notified of the final decision.

This sequence of interaction ensures that each phase in the approval process is documented and organized, facilitating transparent communication between the designers and leadership, and promoting efficient iteration on the project deliverables.

To visualize the process as per the user story in a Sequence Diagram using PlantUML, we would need to depict the interactions between the camp administrator, the platform (with its backend database), and potentially the parents/campers who are submitting the forms. 

Note: Since actual code can be quite extensive and customized, the following is a simplified version to illustrate the core interactions for tracking form submissions by campers as desired by a camp administrator.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "Camp Management\nPlatform" as platform
database Database

admin -> platform : Access camper profiles
platform -> Database : Fetch camper information
Database -> platform : Camper details
platform -> admin : Display camper profiles

admin -> platform : Request submitted forms list
platform -> Database : Query submitted forms by camper
Database -> platform : List of forms per camper
platform -> admin : Display submitted forms

group Form Submission
    participant Parent as parent
    participant "Camper" as camper

    alt If Parent submits
        parent -> platform : Log in
        platform -> parent : Authentication success
        parent -> platform : Submit forms for camper
        platform -> Database : Update form submission status
        Database -> platform : Confirmation of submission
        platform -> parent : Display submission success
    else If Camper submits
        camper -> platform : Log in
        platform -> camper : Authentication success
        camper -> platform : Submit forms
        platform -> Database : Update form submission status
        Database -> platform : Confirmation of submission
        platform -> camper : Display submission success
    end
end

admin -> platform : Request updated forms list
platform -> Database : Query updated forms by camper
Database -> platform : Updated list of forms per camper
platform -> admin : Display updated forms

**Explanation:**

1. **Administrator initiates process**: The camp administrator accesses the platform to review camper profiles and request a list of submitted forms.

2. **Platform fetches data**: The platform interacts with its backend database to fetch and return information on camper profiles and the status of form submissions.

3. **Form submission process by Parent or Camper**: This segment illustrates how either a parent or the camper can log in to the platform, submit necessary forms, and receive confirmation of their submissions. The platform updates the database accordingly to reflect the new submission status.

4. **Final request for updated forms**: The camp administrator requests an updated list of submitted forms to ensure that all required legal documents have been properly submitted.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation of the desired functionalities related to tracking form submissions within the Camp Management & Communication Platform. Keep in mind, depending on the platform's complexity, additional details and steps might be required for a complete implementation.

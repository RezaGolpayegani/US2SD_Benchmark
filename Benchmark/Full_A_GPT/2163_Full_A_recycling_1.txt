Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specific user story you provided involves illustrating the interaction between the user, the RecycleSmart platform, and Google Maps. Below is the PlantUML code that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "RecycleSmart Platform" as RSP
participant "Google Maps" as GM

User -> RSP: Navigate to "Find Recycling Center"
RSP -> RSP: Display nearby centers
RSP --> User: Show list of centers with addresses
User -> RSP: Click on address
RSP -> RSP: Encode address
RSP -> GM: Open new tab with encoded address (URL)
GM --> User: Display map with location
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. The user navigates to the "Find Recycling Center" section of the RecycleSmart platform.
2. The platform processes the user's request and displays a list of nearby recycling centers.
3. The user selects a particular center by clicking on its address.
4. The RecycleSmart platform then encodes the address to be compatible with Google Maps URL parameters.
5. The platform instructs the browser to open a new tab directed to Google Maps, with the encoded address as a parameter, thus showing the user the exact location on the map.

Remember, for this to work, you need to have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor to render the diagram.

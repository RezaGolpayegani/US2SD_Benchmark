Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the User Story "As a restaurant manager, I want to know total sales" involves depicting the interactions between the system's components to fulfill this requirement. The manager would typically interact with the Management and Reporting feature of the Restaurant Management and Operations System to achieve the desired information.

The sequence diagram below represents these interactions using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as mInterface
participant "Reporting Service" as rService
participant "Database" as db

manager -> mInterface: Request total sales information
activate mInterface

mInterface -> rService: Fetch total sales data
activate rService

rService -> db: Query sales transactions
activate db

db --> rService: Return sales transactions
deactivate db

rService --> mInterface: Compute total sales
deactivate rService

mInterface --> manager: Display total sales
deactivate mInterface

### Explanation of the Sequence

1. **Manager to Management Interface**: The sequence begins with the restaurant manager requesting total sales information from the Management Interface. This could be through a dashboard or a specific report request within the software.

2. **Management Interface to Reporting Service**: The Management Interface forwards this request to the Reporting Service, tasked with fetching and computing sales data.

3. **Reporting Service to Database**: The Reporting Service queries the Database to retrieve all the sales transactions. This query is designed to fetch all relevant data that contribute to the total sales figure.

4. **Database to Reporting Service**: The Database returns the queried sales transactions data to the Reporting Service.

5. **Reporting Service Calculation and Response**: With the sales transactions data retrieved, the Reporting Service computes the total sales figure. This calculation may involve summing the sales amount over a specific period.

6. **Management Interface to Manager**: Finally, the Management Interface displays or presents the computed total sales figure to the manager, completing the sequence.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and can be detailed further depending on the system's complexities, such as handling multiple currencies, tax implications, discounts, and returns as part of the sales computation.

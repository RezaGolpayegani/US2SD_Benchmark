Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the stated user story requires understanding the interactions between the authenticated user and the system components during the sponsorship payment process. Below is an illustrative PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Authenticated User" as user
participant "Sponsorship Page" as page
participant "Payment Module" as payment
participant "Database" as db
participant "Email Service" as email

user -> page: Select $350 Company Sponsorship Level
activate user
activate page
page -> db: Retrieve Payment Information
activate db
db --> page: Show Payment Details
page -> user: Display Payment Options
deactivate db

user -> payment: Initiate $350 Payment
activate payment
payment -> db: Verify Sponsorship Level
activate db
db --> payment: Confirm Sponsorship Level
deactivate db

payment -> db: Process $350 Payment
activate db
db --> payment: Payment Successful
deactivate db

payment --> user: Payment Confirmation
deactivate payment

payment -> email: Send Confirmation Email
activate email
db -> email: Retrieve User Email
email -> user: Email Payment Confirmation
deactivate email

deactivate user
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Select Sponsorship Level**: The authenticated user selects the $350 Company Sponsorship Level on the Sponsorship Page.
2. **Display Payment Options**: The Sponsorship Page communicates with the Database to retrieve and then show the user payment details and options.
3. **Initiate Payment**: The user initiates the payment through the Payment Module.
4. **Verify Sponsorship Level**: The Payment Module verifies the sponsorship level with the Database.
5. **Process Payment**: The Payment Module processes the $350 payment, with the Database updating payment status as successful.
6. **Send Confirmation**: The Payment Module sends a payment confirmation to the user.
7. **Email Confirmation**: The Email Service sends a detailed confirmation email to the user's email address, with the Database providing the necessary user email details.

This sequence ensures that the authenticated user can seamlessly pay for and secure a company sponsorship, enhancing the sponsorship engagement process for BADCamp without necessitating direct intervention from event personnel.

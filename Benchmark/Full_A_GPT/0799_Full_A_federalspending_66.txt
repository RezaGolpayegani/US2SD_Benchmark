Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves mapping out the interaction between the different entities involved when an Agency user uploads a file with the wrong extension. The entities typically include the User (Agency user), Frontend Interface, Validation Service, and User Notification Service. Here's how the interactions might be depicted in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AgencyUser as User
participant "Frontend Interface" as UI
participant "Validation Service" as Validator
participant "User Notification Service" as Notifier

User -> UI : Uploads file with wrong extension
UI -> Validator : Sends file metadata
alt File extension valid
    Validator -> UI : Validation success
else File extension invalid
    Validator -> Notifier : Trigger error notification
    Notifier -> UI : Display file-level error message
    UI -> User : Shows helpful error "Unsupported file extension. Please upload [.allowed extensions]."
end
@enduml
```

Explanation:

1. **AgencyUser (User)**: This is the actor initiating the sequence by attempting to upload a file with the wrong extension.
2. **Frontend Interface (UI)**: The UI is the platform that the agency user interacts with. It's responsible for capturing and sending the file metadata (including the file extension) to the Validation Service for checking.
3. **Validation Service (Validator)**: This service checks the file metadata sent by the UI. It determines if the file extension is valid or not according to the platform's allowed file formats.
4. **User Notification Service (Notifier)**: In case of an invalid file extension, the Validation Service triggers the User Notification Service to inform the user about the error.
5. **Conditional Logic (alt/else)**: The diagram includes a condition where if the file extension is valid, the process ends successfully. If invalid, the sequence continues to the Notifier service, resulting in displaying an error message to the user.

This flow ensures that if an agency user uploads a file with the wrong extension, they receive immediate and clear feedback on the nature of the error, guiding them towards resolving the issue by uploading a file with an acceptable format.

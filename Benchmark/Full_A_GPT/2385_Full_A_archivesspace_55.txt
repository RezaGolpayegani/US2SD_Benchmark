Creating a sequence diagram for the user login process involves representing different system components and user interactions that lead to successful authentication. PlantUML is a tool that allows for easy creation of UML diagrams, including sequence diagrams, using a simple markup language. Below is an example of how you could create a PlantUML sequence diagram for a user login process in the context of the Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement project. This example includes LDAP authentication and local login options as mentioned in the project description.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Login Interface" as Login
participant "Authentication Controller" as AuthController
database "LDAP Server" as LDAP
database "Local Database" as LocalDB

User -> Login: Enter credentials\n(username and password)
Login -> AuthController: Validate credentials
alt LDAP Authentication
    AuthController -> LDAP: Check credentials
    LDAP --> AuthController: Authentication Success/Failure
else Local Authentication
    AuthController -> LocalDB: Check credentials
    LocalDB --> AuthController: Authentication Success/Failure
end
AuthController --> Login: Authentication Result
alt Authentication Success
    Login --> User: Display Dashboard/Home Page
else Authentication Failure
    Login --> User: Display Error Message\n(Invalid credentials or account not found)
end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the user entering their credentials (username and password) on the login interface. The login interface then sends these credentials to the Authentication Controller, which is responsible for validating them. This controller may check the credentials against an LDAP server or a local database, depending on the setup. Based on the response from the LDAP server or local database, the Authentication Controller sends the result back to the login interface, which then either shows the user their dashboard/home page (on success) or an error message (on failure).

The `alt` and `else` blocks in PlantUML allow you to illustrate alternative paths, such as LDAP Authentication versus Local Authentication, and success versus failure outcomes.

To use this diagram, you'll need to install PlantUML and run the above code through the PlantUML processor, or use an online PlantUML editor that can render it directly in your web browser.

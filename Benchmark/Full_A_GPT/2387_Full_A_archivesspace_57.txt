To fulfill your request, I'll provide a basic PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process an Archivist might follow to assign location information to a container within the CAMS project framework. This example is a simplified representation and may need adjustments to fit the specific technical architecture and processes of your actual project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "CAMS Interface" as interface
participant "Authorization Module" as auth
participant "Container Management" as container_mgmt
participant "Location Service" as location_service
participant "Database" as db

== Assign Location Information to a Container ==

archivist -> interface : Selects Container
interface -> container_mgmt : Retrieve Container Details
container_mgmt -> db : Query Container Data
db -> container_mgmt : Container Data
container_result -> interface : Display Container Details
archivist -> interface : Requests to Assign Location
interface -> auth : Validate Archivist Permissions
auth -> interface : Permissions Granted

alt Permissions Granted
    archivist -> interface : Input Location Details
    interface -> location_service : Process Location Information
    location_service -> db : Update Container with Location
    db -> location_service : Confirmation
    location_service -> interface : Location Assigned
    interface -> archivist : Display Success Message
else Permissions Denied
    interface -> archivist : Display Error Message
end

### Explanation:
- **Archivist**: The user who wants to assign location information to a container.
- **CAMS Interface**: The front-end UI through which the archivist interacts with the system.
- **Authorization Module**: Validates that the archivist has the necessary permissions to assign a location.
- **Container Management**: Handles operations related to the retrieval and manipulation of container records.
- **Location Service**: Manages the processing of location information, ensuring that it is correctly mapped onto the specified container.
- **Database**: The system's backend storage that contains all data, including containers and their assigned locations.

In this sequence:
1. The Archivist selects a container within the CAMS interface to assign location information to.
2. The container's details are retrieved and presented to the archivist.
3. Upon requesting to assign a location, the system checks if the archivist has the necessary permissions.
4. If permissions are granted, the archivist inputs the location details, which are then processed and updated in the database.
5. The database confirms the update, and the CAMS interface informs the archivist of the successful assignment with a success message.

This diagram is simplified for clarity and brevity. Depending on your project's complexity, additional elements such as error handling, logging, and more detailed user interaction steps might be necessary for a complete implementation.

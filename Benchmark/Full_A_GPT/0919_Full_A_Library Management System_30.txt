Given the complexity and multifaceted nature of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), it's paramount to detail interactions for a specific process. Below, we're focusing on how a librarian updates the status of a book as checked-out during the checkout process. This process involves interactions among several components such the librarian UI (User Interface), the server side of the CLMS, the database, and possibly, notifications subsystems for sending out alerts or emails to users regarding the status change. 

For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we'll encapsulate all server-side actions within a singular "Server" participant, though in reality, these may involve several different server-side controllers or services.

Here's an example of how this process could be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Librarian UI" as ui
participant "Server" as server
database "Database" as db
participant "Notifications Module" as notifications

librarian -> ui : Selects book for checkout
ui -> server : Request to checkout book(bookId, userId)
alt Book is available for checkout
  server -> db : Query to update book status to "checked-out"(bookId)
  db --> server : Confirm status update
  server -> notifications : Send checkout notification(userId, bookId)
  notifications -> librarian : Display checkout success message
else Book not available
  server -> librarian : Display error message(book not available)
end

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Librarian**: Initiates the process by selecting a book and indicating the checkout action through the Librarian UI.
- **Librarian UI**: Acts as the interface through which the librarian communicates with the system.
- **Server**: Represents the backend logic; it receives the checkout request, interacts with the database to update the book status, and triggers notifications if necessary.
- **Database**: Stores all information regarding book statuses, user memberships, and more. It updates the book status to "checked-out" upon request from the server.
- **Notifications Module**: A subsystem that could send out email or SMS notifications to users about various actions. In this case, it would inform the relevant user that a book status has been updated to "checked-out".

Note: In a real-world scenario, the "Server" might represent multiple microservices, including but not limited to a checkout service, user management service, and notification service. Also, the process could involve more detailed error handling and security checks (e.g., validating librarian credentials, checking user's borrowing limits) that are simplified in this diagram for clarity.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves understanding the interactions between the system components and the user (in this case, the librarian). Below, I provide a PlantUML code snippet that illustrates these interactions for viewing the most frequently borrowed books' statistics in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Server" as S
participant "Database" as D

L -> W : Log in to system
activate W
W -> S : Request login authentication
activate S
S -> D : Validate librarian credentials
activate D
D --> S : Credentials valid
deactivate D
S --> W : Authentication successful
deactivate S
W --> L : Display dashboard
deactivate W

L -> W : Select "View Statistics"
activate W
W -> S : Request most frequently borrowed books data
activate S
S -> D : Query for most borrowed books statistics
activate D
D --> S : Return statistics data
deactivate D
S --> W : Process and format statistics
deactivate S
W --> L : Display most frequently borrowed books statistics
deactivate W

This sequence diagram starts with the librarian logging into the system and accessing the dashboard through the web interface. Once logged in, the librarian selects the option to view statistics, specifically the most frequently borrowed books. The web interface forwards this request to the server, which then queries the database for the required statistics. The database returns the data to the server, which processes and formats it before the web interface displays it to the librarian.

This diagram is simplified and focuses on the main interactions for the described user story. Depending on the system's complexity and the specific requirements, additional steps or components (such as error handling, security measures, or intermediate services) could also be included in a more detailed design.

Given your request, here's a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: **"As a customer, I want to read book recommendations."** This sequence involves interaction between the customer and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), specifically focusing on retrieving and displaying book recommendations.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Customer
participant WebInterface as "Web Interface"
participant Server as "Backend Server"
participant Database as "Database"

Customer -> WebInterface : Requests to view recommendations
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> Server : Fetch recommendations request
activate Server

Server -> Database : Query for recommendations
activate Database

Database --> Server : Return recommendations data
deactivate Database

Server --> WebInterface : Recommendations data
deactivate Server

WebInterface --> Customer : Display recommendations
deactivate WebInterface
@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Customer Requests:** The customer initiates the process by requesting to view book recommendations through the system's web interface.
2. **Web Interface to Backend Server:** The web interface forwards this request to the backend server to fetch the relevant book recommendations.
3. **Query Database:** The backend server processes this request and queries the database for the list of recommended books, based on certain criteria like popularity, ratings, genres, etc.
4. **Database Response:** The database returns the data for the requested book recommendations to the backend server.
5. **Server to Web Interface:** The backend server processes this information and sends it back to the web interface.
6. **Display to Customer:** Finally, the web interface presents the book recommendations to the customer for viewing.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction process for reading book recommendations in the CLMS. Remember, implementations can vary, and additional details or steps can be included, especially for handling errors, authentication (ensuring the customer is logged in), and possibly filtering recommendations based on the customer's past borrowing history or preferences.

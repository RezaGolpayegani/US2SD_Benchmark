Creating a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story specified requires outlining the interaction flow between the user, the Neurohub platform, and the collaborative spreadsheet feature within the context of the user story. Here's an example of how this might be depicted in Plant UML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as u
participant WebInterface as web
participant SpreadsheetService as ss
database DataStore as ds

== User Initiates Spreadsheet Editing ==
u -> web: Access proposal project
activate web

web -> ss: Initialize Spreadsheet
activate ss

ss -> ds: Retrieve Spreadsheet Data
activate ds
ds --> ss: Return Data
deactivate ds

ss --> web: Spreadsheet Ready
deactivate ss

web --> u: Display Spreadsheet
deactivate web

== Collaborative Editing ==
u -> web: Edit Spreadsheet
activate web

web -> ss: Update Data
activate ss

ss -> ds: Save Changes
activate ds
ds --> ss: Confirm Save
deactivate ds

ss --> web: Update Success
deactivate ss

web -> web: Notify Collaborators
activate web

web -> ss: Push Update
activate ss

ss -> ds: Retrieve Updated Data
activate ds
ds --> ss: Return Updated Data
deactivate ds

ss --> web: Updated Spreadsheet Ready
deactivate ss

web --> u: Display Updated Spreadsheet
deactivate web

This Plant UML code snippet outlines the following steps in the workflow:

1. **User Initiates Spreadsheet Editing**: The user accesses the proposal project on the Neurohub Web interface, which initializes the spreadsheet service to retrieve and display the stored spreadsheet data.
2. **Collaborative Editing**: When the user edits the spreadsheet, these changes are sent to the spreadsheet service, which updates the data store. The service confirms the save, and the web interface notifies all collaborators of the update. The updated spreadsheet data is then fetched from the store, and the displayed spreadsheet is refreshed for all users.

Please note, this is a simplified example to fit the scope of a Plant UML sequence diagram as per the provided user story scenario. The actual implementation might include additional layers of interaction, such as authentication, error handling, and real-time collaboration features.

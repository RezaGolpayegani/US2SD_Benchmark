Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story involves mapping out the interactions between different system components and the user in PlantUML code. Given the project description for the Digital Archive Management Enhancement project and focusing on the user story of a researcher wanting to understand the copyright status of an image, the following is a conceptual outline translated into PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Database" as DB
participant "File Management System" as FMS
participant "Licensing Module" as License

Researcher -> Search: Enter search criteria
Search -> DB: Query for images based on criteria
DB -> Search: Return search results
Researcher -> Search: Select an image
Search -> FMS: Request selected image details
FMS -> DB: Retrieve image metadata
DB -> FMS: Image metadata
FMS -> License: Request copyright status
License -> DB: Fetch copyright information
DB -> License: Return copyright information
License -> FMS: Copyright status
FMS -> Search: Display image details and copyright status
Search -> Researcher: Show image details and copyright status

This sequence diagram starts with the Researcher performing a search through the Search Interface. The interface interacts with the Database to fetch and display relevant search results. When the researcher selects an image for more details, the request is passed to the File Management System, which retrieves the metadata of the image from the Database. To determine the copyright status, the File Management required information is requested from the Licensing Module, which in turn fetches this information from the Database. Finally, the comprehensive details, including the copyright status of the selected image, are displayed to the researcher.

This sequence illustrates a streamlined process for a researcher to understand the copyright status of an image, highlighting the system's functionality to manage and display crucial information effectively. Itâ€™s important to adjust the sequence based on the specific software architecture and interactions inherent in the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project.

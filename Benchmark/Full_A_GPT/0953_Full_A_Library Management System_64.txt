To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story—"As a librarian, I want to keep track of subscriptions"—using PlantUML, we need to outline the steps involved in this process. The sequence will involve interactions between the librarian, the system's frontend interface, the backend server, and the database. 

Given the complexity of a full sequence diagram covering every potential interaction, the following example focuses on key steps: accessing subscription details, updating subscription status, and generating reports or alerts for subscriptions that require attention (e.g., renewals, expirations). 

We'll assume the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) offers a Web-based interface for librarians and connects to a backend system that manages data in a relational database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Backend Server" as backendServer
participant "Database" as database

== Track Subscription Status ==
librarian -> webInterface : Access Subscription Management
webInterface -> backendServer : Request current subscriptions data
backendServer -> database : Query subscription details
database --> backendServer : Return subscription data
backendServer --> webInterface : Display subscription information
librarian <-- webInterface : View subscription details

== Update Subscription ==
librarian -> webInterface : Select subscription to update
webInterface -> backendServer : Send update request (Change status, renew, etc.)
backendServer -> database : Update subscription record
database --> backendServer : Confirm update
backendServer --> webInterface : Update confirmation
librarian <-- webInterface : Receive update confirmation

== Generate Subscription Report ==
librarian -> webInterface : Request subscription report
webInterface -> backendServer : Query for report data (e.g., expiring soon)
backendServer -> database : Extract required report data
database --> backendServer : Report data result
backendServer --> webInterface : Display report
librarian <-- webInterface : View generated report

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions for tracking subscriptions as a librarian. The steps include accessing the subscription management section, updating a subscription status, and generating a subscription report. Transactions with the database are straightforward CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations managed by the backend server upon requests from the Web interface.

For a full implementation, additional details like authentication, error handling, and more intricate scenarios involving multi-step processes or conditional logic (e.g., handling different subscription types, automatic renewal policies) could be added.

To visualize the user story of a Cornell faculty member wishing to see and understand the reuse rights for files discovered in the repository, we can create a sequence diagram that reflects the interactions between the user and the system. Below is a PlantUML code sequence diagram, which outlines the steps involved in this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as "Cornell Faculty\nMember"
participant WebInterface as "Web Interface"
participant SearchModule as "Search Module"
participant RepositoryDB as "Repository\nDatabase"
participant RightsManagement as "Rights\nManagement System"

== Check Reuse Rights for Discovered Files ==

FacultyMember -> WebInterface: Request to search files
WebInterface -> SearchModule: Initiate file search
SearchModule -> RepositoryDB: Query files
RepositoryDB -> SearchModule: Return search results
SearchModule -> WebInterface: Display search results
FacultyMember -> WebInterface: Select file of interest

WebInterface -> RightsManagement: Request reuse rights info for selected file
RightsManagement -> RepositoryDB: Fetch rights information
RepositoryDB -> RightsGraph: Return rights data
RightsManagement -> WebInterface: Process and format rights info
WebInterface -> FacultyMember: Display file reuse rights

### Explanation:

1. **Cornell Faculty Member:** The user initiates the process by requesting to search files through the web interface of the digital repository system.
2. **Web Interface:** Acts as the main interaction layer for the faculty member, taking search requests and displaying results. 
3. **Search Module:** Receives the search request from the web interface and queries the repository database for files matching the search criteria.
4. **Repository Database (RepositoryDB):** Stores information about the files in the repository, including metadata and rights information.
5. **Rights Management System:** Processes requests for reuse rights information for specific files. It fetches this data from the repository database and prepares it for display.
6. **RightsGraph:** While not explicitly called out in the initial description, this would be an internal logic within the Rights Management System or a separate module that processes and encodes the details about reuse rights, based on the metadata stored in the RepositoryDB.
7. **Process Flow:** After searching and selecting a file, the faculty member queries the reuse rights of the file. The Rights Management System fetches this information from the database, formats it, and the web interface presents it back to the faculty member.

This sequence diagram is a generalized representation and may be adjusted depending on specific implementation details or additional features of the repository system.

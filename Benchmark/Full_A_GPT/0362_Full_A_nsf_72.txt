Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a team member, I want to know when meetings are, so that I can plan accordingly" involves depicting the interactions between the team member and the systems or processes designed to notify them of upcoming meetings. This example assumes that the notification process involves a project management tool or platform that the NSF Beta Site Development and User/openResearch Initiative team might use for scheduling and announcing meetings.

Given the nature of your project and its emphasis on communication and collaboration, this sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrates a simplified process for notifying a team member of meeting schedules.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant TeamMember as TM
participant ProjectManagementTool as PMT
participant Calendar as Cal

== Initialization ==
TM -> PMT: Check upcoming meetings
activate PMT
PMT -> Cal: Request meetings schedule
activate Cal
Cal --> PMT: Return meetings schedule
deactivate Cal
PMT --> TM: Display upcoming meetings
deactivate PMT

== Notification ==
PMT -> TM: Send meeting notification
activate TM
TM -> PMT: Acknowledge notification
deactivate TM

== Adding to Personal Calendar ==
TM -> Cal: Add meeting to personal calendar
activate Cal
Cal --> TM: Confirm meeting added
deactivate Cal

This sequence diagram outlines the major steps a team member would take to be informed of upcoming meetings, leveraging a project management tool with calendar integration. The process starts with the team member checking for upcoming meetings, proceeding to a notification from the project management tool, and then adding the meeting to their personal calendar if desired.

1. **Initialization**: The team member initiates a request to the project management tool to check for upcoming meetings.
2. **Notification**: The project management tool sends a meeting notification to the team member, which includes all necessary details about the meeting.
3. **Adding to Personal Calendar**: The team member decides to add the meeting to their personal calendar, with the system confirming the addition.

This is a basic representation and can be further detailed or expanded based on the specific tools, platforms, and processes your team uses for scheduling and communication.

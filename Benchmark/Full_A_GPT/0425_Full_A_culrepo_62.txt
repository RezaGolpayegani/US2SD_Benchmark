To address your request, I will draft a PlantUML sequence diagram code that represents the user story of a library staff member wanting to add custom metadata fields for deposits on behalf of researchers. This scenario is visualized as a sequence of interactions between the library staff member and the digital repository system, along with any involved subsystems or services necessary for accomplishing the task.

Please note, the depiction focuses on the interactions necessary to realize the feature described in the user story. For a more comprehensive understanding, additional context or system specifications might be required, which are not covered here due to the synopsis format.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Staff" as LS
participant "Repository System Interface" as RSI
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Metadata Management" as MM
participant "Database" as DB

LS -> RSI: Access content deposit form
RSI --> LS: Display deposit form

activate LS
LS -> RSI: Choose to add custom metadata
deactivate LS

RSI -> CMS: Request custom metadata field addition
activate CMS
CMS -> MM: Initiate custom field creation
activate MM

MM -> MM: Validate custom metadata requirements
MM -> DB: Create custom metadata field in schema
activate DB
DB --> MM: Confirm field creation
deactivate DB

MM --> CMS: Custom metadata field created
deactivate MM
CMS --> RSI: Custom field addition successful
RSI --> LS: Show confirmation & updated form with custom field
activate LS
LS -> RSI: Complete deposit with custom metadata
RSI -> CMS: Process deposit with custom metadata
activate CMS
CMS -> DB: Store deposit with custom metadata
activate DB
DB --> CMS: Confirm storage
deactivate DB
CMS --> RSI: Deposit successful
RSI --> LS: Display success message
deactivate CMS
deactivate LS

### How to Use This Diagram
1. **Setting Up PlantUML:** Ensure you have PlantUML set up in your environment. PlantUML can be run as a standalone tool, within various IDEs, or through its online server.
2. **Rendering the Diagram:** Copy the entire PlantUML code segment above into your PlantUML editor or tool of choice to generate the sequence diagram. The diagram visually represents the sequence of operations initiated by a library staff member to add custom metadata fields during the content deposit process.

### Diagram Explanation:
- The sequence starts with the library staff accessing the content deposit form through the repository system interface.
- The library staff selects the option to add a custom metadata field, which prompts the content management system to handle this request.
- The content management system collaborates with the metadata management system to validate and create the requested custom metadata field in the database schema.
- Once the database confirms the creation of the custom field, the information flows back to the library staff, showing that the custom field has been successfully added. 
- Finally, the library staff completes the deposit with the newly added custom metadata, and the system confirms the successful deposit.

This sequence focuses on the steps to add custom metadata fields, highlighting the interaction between the library staff and the systems involved in content and metadata management.

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story using PlantUML, we would outline the interactions between the system components involved in updating and displaying the updated date and time in the header information box for an Agency user. Below is an example of how to represent this process in PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Agency User" as user
participant "UI Component" as ui
participant "Backend Service" as backend
participant "Database" as db

user -> ui : Request Page
activate ui

ui -> backend : Get Header Info
activate backend

backend -> db : Query Updated Info
activate db

db --> backend : Return Updated Date & Time
deactivate db

backend --> ui : Header Info with Date & Time
deactivate backend

ui --> user : Display Page with Updated Header
deactivate ui

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the process starts with the Agency User requesting a page. The UI Component (representing the web interface) then requests the updated header information from the Backend Service. The Backend Service queries the Database for the most recent update information, which includes the date and time. Once the Database returns this data, the Backend Service processes it and sends it back to the UI Component, which then displays the updated information on the page for the Agency User. 

Note that this is a simplified diagram to illustrate the user story, focusing specifically on the interactions related to updating and displaying the header information box's update timestamp. Depending on the complexity and the actual architecture of the Broker Platform, there might be additional steps or components involved, such as authentication and authorization, caching mechanisms, or more detailed sub-system interactions.

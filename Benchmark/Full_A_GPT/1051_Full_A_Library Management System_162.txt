Given your requirement, here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a library member, I want to look up books listed by subject category so that I can find the book I am looking for easier." This diagram outlines the interaction between the system components involved in looking up books by subject category.

Please note that customization and additional detail might be required to fully match your project's specifications and technology stack.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Web UI" as webui
participant "Search Controller" as controller
participant "Database" as db

member -> webui : Enter search criteria (Subject Category)
webui -> controller : Request books by subject(category)
controller -> db : Query books by category(category)
db -> controller : Return book list
controller -> webui : Display book results
webui -> member : Show books by specified category

@enduml
```

This diagram simplifies the process into key interactions:

1. **Library Member**: Initiates the process by entering search criteria focused on the subject category into the web interface (Web UI).
2. **Web UI**: Receives the search criteria and forwards it to the Search Controller.
3. **Search Controller**: Processes the request by querying the Database for books matching the specified subject category.
4. **Database**: Searches for and returns the list of books that match the query criteria.
5. **Search Controller**: Takes the list of books from the Database and returns it to the Web UI.
6. **Web UI**: Displays the results to the Library Member.

This sequence illustrates the basic interactions and flow when a library member wishes to find books by a specific subject category in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Depending on the specifics of your project, such as the use of microservices, APIs, or additional layers of logic (e.g., for authorization, filtering, or sorting), you might need to adapt and expand this diagram accordingly.

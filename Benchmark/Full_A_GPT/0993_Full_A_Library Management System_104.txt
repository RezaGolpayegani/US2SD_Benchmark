Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story “As a librarian, I want to update books' shelf information” requires outlining how different system components interact to achieve this functionality. Below is a basic PlantUML code representation of the sequence diagram for this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as LMS
database BooksDB

== Update Book Shelf Information ==

Librarian -> LMS : Login()
activate LMS
LMS -> BooksDB : ValidateLibrarian()
activate BooksDB
BooksDB --> LMS : AuthenticationSuccess()
deactivate BooksDB

Librarian -> LMS : SelectBookToUpdateShelfInfo(BookID)
LMS -> BooksDB : FetchBookDetails(BookID)
BooksDB --> LMS : BookDetails()
LMS --> Librarian : DisplayBookDetails(BookDetails)

Librarian -> LMS : InputNewShelfInfo(NewShelfInfo)
LMS -> BooksDB : UpdateShelfInfo(BookID, NewShelfInfo)
activate BooksDB
BooksDB --> LMS : UpdateSuccess()
deactivate BooksDB
LMS --> Librarian : DisplayUpdateSuccessMessage()

deactivate LMS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows these key steps:

1. **Login:** The librarian logs into the Library Management System (LMS). The system verifies the librarian’s credentials against the Books Database (BooksDB).
   
2. **Book Selection:** Once authenticated, the librarian selects a book to update shelf information by providing the BookID.

3. **Display Book Details:** The system retrieves and displays the book's current details, including its current shelf location, from BooksDB.

4. **Input New Shelf Info:** The librarian inputs the new shelf information for the book.
   
5. **Update Database:** The LMS updates the book's shelf information in BooksDB with the new details provided by the librarian.

6. **Confirmation:** The system confirms the successful update to the librarian.

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the librarian, the Library Management System interface, and the backend Books Database during the process of updating a book’s shelf information.

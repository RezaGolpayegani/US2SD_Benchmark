Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves outlining the interactions between objects or components in the Scrum Alliance Community Platform's system for setting listing fees for other courses or events by a site administrator. Below is the PlantUML code to generate the desired sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin as "Site Administrator"
participant UI as "Admin Interface"
participant Controller as "FeeController"
database DB as "Database"

== Set Listing Fee for Other Courses or Events ==

Admin -> UI: Access fee settings
UI -> Controller: Navigate to set fee for courses/events
Controller -> DB: Retrieve current fee settings
DB --> Controller: Current fee settings
Controller --> UI: Show current fees
Admin -> UI: Enter new fee & submit
UI -> Controller: Update fee settings for courses/events
Controller -> DB: Save new fee settings
DB --> Controller: Confirmation
Controller --> UI: Show update confirmation
UI --> Admin: Display success message

@enduml
```

To use this code for generating the diagram:

1. Ensure you have PlantUML installed or access to an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy the provided code and paste it into the PlantUML editor.
3. Generate the diagram to visualize the sequence described in the code.

This sequence diagram follows the process from the site administrator's intention to change the listing fee, going through the admin interface, interacting with a controller to update the fee in the database, and finally confirming that the update has been successful. This is a high-level view that focuses on the interactions and data flow specific to setting the course or event listing fee.

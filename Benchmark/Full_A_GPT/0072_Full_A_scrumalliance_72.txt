Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a site visitor, I want to be able to get back to the home page quickly and easily, so that I don't get lost navigating" involves showcasing the interactions between the user (site visitor) and the system components (such as the web interface and the server) to fulfill this need. Here's how you can represent this process using PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Site Visitor" as visitor
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Server" as server

visitor -> web : Click 'Home' icon/button
web -> server : Request Home page URL
server -> web : Return Home page content
web -> visitor : Display Home page
@enduml
```

This diagram simplifies the process to focus on the key steps involving the user's interaction with the system to navigate back to the homepage. Here's a breakdown of the sequence:

1. **Site Visitor**: The actor in this sequence. Represents the user or site visitor who wants to return to the home page.

2. **Web Interface**: Serves as the front-end component the visitor interacts with. It receives the visitor's request to go back to the homepage (usually by clicking a 'Home' icon or button).

3. **Server**: Back-end component that processes requests from the web interface. It locates and sends the requested homepage content back to the web interface.

4. **Clicking the 'Home' icon/button**: The initial action taken by the site visitor. This is where the visitor expresses their intention to return to the homepage.

5. **Request Home page URL**: The web interface translates the user's action into a request for the home page's URL, sending this request to the server.

6. **Return Home page content**: The server processes the request, finds the home page content, and sends it back to the web interface.

7. **Display Home page**: Finally, the web interface renders the home page content for the visitor, effectively bringing them back to the homepage as desired.

This diagram captures a simplified view of the interaction process. Depending on the complexity and specific requirements of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform project, you might need to include additional steps or components (such as caching services or content delivery networks) to accurately reflect the architecture and interactions for navigating back to the home page.

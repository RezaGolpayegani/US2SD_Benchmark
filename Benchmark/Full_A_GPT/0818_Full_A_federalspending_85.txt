Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story you provided involves representing interactions among different system components or actors to fulfill the user's need. The user story "As a FABS user, I want to make sure the historical data includes all necessary columns, so that the information in the database is correct" hints at a process involving the FABS user, the system's data processing unit, possibly a database administrator or a backend system responsible for loading historical FABS data, and the database itself. 

Here's how you might describe this scenario in PlantUML format to create a sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FABSUser as "FABS User"
participant SystemInterface as "Broker Platform Interface"
participant ValidationService as "Data Validation Service"
participant DatabaseService as "Database Service"
participant HistoricalDataService as "Historical Data Loader"
database FABSData as "FABS Database"

FABSUser -> SystemInterface : Request historical data review
SystemInterface -> ValidationService : Validate request
alt Data Request is Valid
    Validation/Service -> HistoricalDataService : Fetch necessary columns for historical data
    HistoricalDataService -> FABSData : Query for historical columns
    FABSData --> HistoricalDataService : Return data schema
    HistoricalDataService --> ValidationService : Confirm data columns presence
    ValidationService --> SystemInterface : Report data validation status
    SystemInterface --> FABSUser : Display data status and missing columns if any
else Data Request is Invalid
    ValidationService --> SystemInterface : Report validation error
    SystemInteface --> FABSUser : Display error message
end

```

This sequence diagram starts with the FABS User requesting a review of the historical data through the Broker Platform Interface. The System Interface forwards this request to the Data Validation Service to validate the request. Assuming the request is valid, the Data Validation Service asks the Historical Data Loader (a service or module responsible for managing historical data operations) to verify if all necessary columns are present in the historical data. The Historical Data Loader queries the FABS Database to fetch the data schema/details. Upon receiving the data schema, the Historical Data Loader checks for the presence of the necessary columns and reports back to the Data Validation Service, which then informs the System Interface. Finally, the System Interface communicates the status of the data validation to the F/ABS User, including any missing columns if applicable. In case the initial data request is invalid, the Data Validation Service notifies the System Interface directly, which then displays an appropriate error message to the FABS User.

Please note, this is a simplified representation. Depending on the system's architecture and the specifics of operations within the Broker platform, additional details or steps might be needed for a fully accurate representation.

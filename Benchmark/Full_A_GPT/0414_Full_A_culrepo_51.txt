Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story specified involves representing the interactions among various system components and actors to fulfill the teaching faculty member's need to identify timely and relevant research and to be notified of new research/content. Here's an outline and a PlantUML code snippet to illustrate these interactions within the context of the Comprehensive Digital Repository System at Cornell University.

### Sequence Diagram Outline:
1. **Start**: The teaching faculty member initiates a search or sets up notifications for new content.
2. **Search/Notification Setup**: Interaction with the system's user interface to input search criteria or configure notifications for new content.
3. **Processing Request**: System processes the input to filter and identify relevant research materials.
4. **Retrieving Data**: Interaction with the content management and notification system to retrieve matching research materials or to set up alerts.
5. **Display Results/Confirm Notification Setup**: System displays the search results or confirms the setup of new content notifications.
6. **User Action**: Faculty selects relevant research materials or configures detailed notification preferences.
7. **Accessing & Integration**: Optionally, the faculty integrates the selected research into their curriculum or confirms the notification settings.
8. **Notification Service**: If notifications have been set up, the system monitors for new content and sends alerts accordingly.
9. **End**: The faculty member reviews the research material or receives notifications about new relevant content.

### PlantUML Code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor TeachingFacultyMember as faculty
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Search/Notification Engine" as SearchEngine
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Notification Service" as NotifService
database "Digital Repository" as Repository

== Identifying Relevant Research ==
faculty -> UI: Specify search criteria/Configure notifications
UI -> SearchEngine: Process search/notification request
SearchEngine -> Repository: Query for matching content
Repository --> SearchEngine: Return results
SearchEngine --> UI: Display results/Confirm setup
faculty -> UI: Select content/Set notification preferences
UI -> CMS: Retrieve selected content details
CMS --> faculty: Display content details/Notification confirmed

== Receiving Notifications for New Content ==
alt New content is published
    Repository -> NotifService: Trigger content notification
    NotifService -> faculty: Send notification about new content
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the basic flow a teaching faculty member would experience while identifying relevant research material for their curriculum and setting up notifications for new research or content. Note that implementation details might vary based on the actual system architecture and requirements.

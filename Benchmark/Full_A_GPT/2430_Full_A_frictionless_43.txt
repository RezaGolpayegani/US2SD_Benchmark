Given the complex and multi-layered functionality of the DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer (DPIE), a sequence diagram for a publisher's user story focused on quickly and easily storing data online might include several key actors and systems. Please note that due to the abstract nature of the DPIE project and its broad integration capabilities, the following PlantUML sequence diagram abstracts certain steps and interactions to focus on essential elements relevant to this task.

The sequence diagram will outline the typical flow from a publisher deciding to publish a data package to the successful storage and catalog listing of this package in an online data repository, facilitated by DPIE components and integrations like GitHub and CKAN.

```plantuml

participant "DPIE Interface" as DPIE

participant CKAN

Publisher -> DPIE : Upload Data Package
activate DPIE
DPIE -> GitHub : Push Data Package
activate GitHub
GitHub -> DPIE : Confirm Push
DPIE -> DPIE : Validate Data Package
note right of DPIE: Validation includes verifying\nthe data integrity, format, and\nconformance to selected profiles.
DPIE -> CKAN : Create Catalog Listing
activate CKAN
CKAN -> DPIE : Confirm Listing
DPIE -> Publisher : Notify Success
deactivate DPIE
deactivate GitHub
deactivate CKAN

### Breakdown of the Sequence:
1. **Upload Data Package:** The Publisher initiates the process by uploading the data package using the DPIE interface.
2. **Push to GitHub:** DPIE integrates with GitHub to store the data package securely. DPIE pushes the data package to a GitHub repository.
3. **Validation:** DPIE validates the uploaded data package, checking for integrity, format, and compliance with the selected Data Package profiles.
4. **Catalog Listing with CKAN:** Upon successful validation, DPIE interfaces with CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network), an open-source data management system, to create a catalog listing for the data package.
5. **Notification of Success:** Once the data package is successfully stored and listed, DPIE notifies the publisher of the successful upload and listing.

This diagram abstracts many intricacies of the DPIE system and broader ecosystem integrations to focus on the user story at hand. In a real-world application, each step could entail much more detailed interactions, especially regarding data package validation, storage specifics, and the handling of metadata.

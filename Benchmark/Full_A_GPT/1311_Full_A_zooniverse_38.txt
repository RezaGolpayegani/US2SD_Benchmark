To create a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a Zooniverse admin, I want to perform automatic detection of plankton size or orientation in Plankton Portal images" using PlantUML, we'll outline the steps involved in this process. The diagram will cover the sequence of interactions among different components of the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) when a Zooniverse admin initiates an automatic detection process for plankton characteristics in images uploaded to the Plankton Portal.

Note: The following PlantUML code is a textual representation of the sequence diagram, which needs to be rendered by a PlantUML processor or a compatible tool to visualize the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor ZooniverseAdmin as "Zooniverse Admin"
participant "AMIDP Interface" as Interface
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "AI Analysis Module" as AI
participant "Database" as DB
participant "User Notification System" as Notification

== Automatic Detection of Plankton Characteristics ==

ZooniverseAdmin -> Interface: Request automatic detection in Plankton Portal images
Interface -> CMS: Fetch selected images
CMS -> AI: Send images for analysis
AI -> AI: Detect plankton size and orientation
AI -> CMS: Return analysis results
CMS -> DB: Store analysis results
DB -> Interface: Confirm storage of results
Interface -> ZooniverseAdmin: Display analysis results
ZooniverseAdmin -> Interface: Request notification for volunteers
Interface -> Notification: Prepare notification content
Notification -> DB: Log notification activity
Interface -> Notification: Send notification to relevant volunteers
Notification -> ZooniverseAdmin: Confirm notifications sent

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Zooniverse Admin initiates the process**: The admin requests an automatic detection of plankton size or orientation in images uploaded to the Plankton Portal via the AMIDP Interface.

2. **Fetching images**: The AMIDP Interface communicates with the Content Management System (CMS) to fetch the selected images for analysis.

3. **Analysis of images**: The CMS sends these images to the AI Analysis Module, which is responsible for detecting the size and orientation of plankton within the images.

4. **Storing results**: Once the AI Analysis Module has completed its analysis, the results are sent back to the CMS, which then stores these results in the Database.

5. **Displaying results**: The AMIDP Interface retrieves confirmation of the stored results from the Database and displays the analysis results to the Zooniverse Admin.

6. **Notification request and sending**: Upon reviewing the results, the Zooniverse Admin may request that a notification be sent to relevant volunteers. The Interface prepares and logs the notification content, then instructs the User Notification System to send out notifications.

7. **Notification confirmation**: The User Notification System sends the notifications to the selected volunteers and confirms the action to the Zooniverse Admin through the Interface.

This sequence diagram represents a high-level overview of the process, focusing on the interaction between the system's components from the initiation of an automatic detection request to the notification of the volunteers.

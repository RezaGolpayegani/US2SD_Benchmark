Given the user story from the project description, we will create a detailed sequence diagram illustrating the process of a reader viewing the top readers of the month to encourage more reading. This sequence diagram will include interaction between the user (reader), the front-end interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the back-end server handling the business logic, and the database where reader statistics are stored.

Please note, the sequence diagram outlined below is textual representation for creating a diagram using PlantUML, a tool designed for creating UML diagrams from a plain text language.

```plaintext
@startuml
participant Reader as reader
participant "Frontend Interface" as frontend
participant "Backend Server" as backend
participant "Database" as db

reader -> frontend: Access top readers page
frontend -> backend: Request top readers of the month
backend -> db: Query for top readers data
db -> backend: Return top readers data
backend -> frontend: Display top readers list
frontend -> reader: Show top readers of the month

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram script illustrates the following process:

1. The reader accesses the top readers page on the CLMS frontend interface.
2. The frontend interface requests the top readers of the month from the backend server.
3. The backend server queries the database for the top readers' data.
4. The database returns the requested data to the backend server.
5. The backend server processes this data and sends it back to the frontend interface.
6. Finally, the frontend interface displays the top readers of the month to the reader.

This sequence aims to fulfill the reader's desire to see top readers, which could motivate them to read more books and aim to be on that list. This diagram demonstrates the flow of data from the initial request by the reader to the presentation of the top readers list using the components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

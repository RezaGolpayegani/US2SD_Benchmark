Given the scope of your project and focusing on the specific user story for a plugin developer, here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This scenario outlines the sequence when a plugin developer wants to include the code for a dataset type in the plugin artifact, ensuring that upon pipeline creation using this plugin, a corresponding dataset instance is generated, made explorable, and available to apps.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant PluginDeveloper as PD
participant PluginArtifact as PA
participant DatasetManagementSystem as DMS
participant ApplicationEcosystem as AE
participant PipelineCreationTool as PCT
participant Database as DB

== Inclusion of Dataset Type in Plugin Artifact ==
PD -> PA : Include Dataset Type Code
activate PA
PA -> DMS : Register Dataset Type
activate DMS
DMS -> DB : Update Dataset Type Registry
activate DB
DB --> DMS : Acknowledge Update
deactivate DB
DMS --> PA : Dataset Type Registered
deactivate DMS
PA --> PD : Dataset Type Included Successfully
deactivate PA

== Pipeline Creation Using Plugin ==
PD -> PCT : Initiate Pipeline Creation
activate PCT
PCT -> DMS : Request Dataset Instance Creation
activate DMS
DMS -> DB : Create New Dataset Instance
activate DB
DB --> DMS : Dataset Instance Created
deactivate DB
DMS --> PCT : Dataset Instance Available
deactivate DMS
PCT -> AE : Integrate Pipeline with Dataset Instance
activate AE
AE --> PCT : Pipeline & Dataset Instance Integrated
deactivate AE
PCT --> PD : Pipeline Creation Successful
deactivate PCT

== Making Dataset Instance Explorable and Available ==
DMS -> AE : Make Dataset Instance Explorable
activate AE
AE --> DMS : Dataset Instance is Now Explorable
deactivate AE
DMS -> AE : Make Dataset Instance Available to Apps
activate AE
AE --> DMS : Dataset Instance Available to Apps
deactivate AE

This sequence diagram starts with the plugin developer including the dataset type code in the plugin artifact. The dataset management system then registers this dataset type, updating the dataset type registry in the database. Upon successful registration, the pipeline creation tool can initiate the creation of a pipeline using this plugin, which includes requesting the creation of a dataset instance of the included type. The dataset management system handles this by creating a new instance in the database. Once created, this instance is made explorable and available to applications within the ecosystem, following the system's mechanisms for integration and availability.

Each participant (or system component) is involved in specific actions following a clear sequence, reflecting the high-level interactions needed to fulfill the described user story. This diagram is a simplified representation and can be further detailed with error handling, timeouts, or more specific interactions tailored to your system's architecture and requirements.

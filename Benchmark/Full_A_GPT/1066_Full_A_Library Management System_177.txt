Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story involves illustrating the interaction between the user (library member) and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) with a focus on seeing the place of a book for easy access.

The user story is: As a library member, I want to see the place of a book so that I can easily reach it.

Below is the PlantUML code to represent this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryMember as member
participant WebInterface as web
participant CLMSServer as server
participant Database as db

member -> web : Search for book
web -> server : Request book details
server -> db : Query book location
db -> server : Return book location
server -> web : Display book location
web -> member : Show book location (shelf number/section)

@enduml
```

This diagram begins with the Library Member searching for a book through the Web Interface (e.g., through a web browser accessing the CLMS). The Web Interface then communicates this request to the CLMS Server, which in turn queries the Database for the book's location details. The Database returns the location of the book (such as a specific shelf number and section) back to the server, which is then conveyed to the Web Interface. Finally, the Web Interface displays this information back to the Library Member, enabling them to see where the book is located and ease the process of reaching it.

Note: This code snippet is a basic representation. The actual implementation might include more detailed interactions based on the system's architecture, such as authentication and error handling processes, or interactive maps for larger libraries.

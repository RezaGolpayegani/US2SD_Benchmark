Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As an authenticated user, I want to view the job board, so that I can look for an interesting Drupal gig," requires considering all the major components involved in this process within the BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform. Here's how it could be depicted using PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AuthenticatedUser as User
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Job Board Service" as JobBoard
participant "Database" as DB

User -> Auth : Authenticate
activate Auth
Auth --> User : Authentication Success
deactivate Auth

User -> JobBoard : Request to view Job Board
activate JobBoard

JobBoard -> DB : Query Job Listings
activate DB
DB --> JobBoard : Return Job Listings
deactivate DB

JobBoard --> User : Display Job Listings
deactivate JobBoard
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **User Authentication:** The user interacts with the platform by trying to authenticate themselves. This step is crucial because viewing job listings is restricted to authenticated users.
   
2. **Authentication Success:** The authentication service responds to the user after successful authentication, allowing them access to authenticated-user-specific functionalities, which includes viewing the job board.

3. **Request to View Job Board:** The authenticated user sends a request to the Job Board Service to view the available job listings. This request is a result of user action after logging in and wanting to explore Drupal gigs.

4. **Query Job Listings:** The Job Board Service then communicates with the database to fetch the available job listings. This step involves querying the database to retrieve information that is relevant and permitted for the authenticated user to view.

5. **Display Job Listings:** Finally, the Job Board Service sends the data back to the user's interface, where the job listings are displayed. This allows the authenticated user to browse through the various Drupal gigs available.

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in enabling an authenticated user to view job listings on the platform. It showcases the interactions between the user, authentication services, job board services, and the database, providing a clear overview of the process from initiating a request to displaying the job listings.

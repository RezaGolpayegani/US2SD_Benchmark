To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story using PlantUML, we need to consider the steps involved for a library staff member to communicate with researchers about the digital repository system, focusing on its capabilities for archiving and sharing research results in alignment with funder Digital Management Plan (DMP) requirements.

Given the complexity and the high-level description provided, the following sequence diagram illustrates the essential interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as R
participant "Library Staff" as LS
participant "Repository System" as RS
participant "DMP Tool" as DMP

== Conversation Between Researcher and Library Staff ==
R -> LS : Inquire about fulfilling DMP requirements
LS -> R : Explains Cornell's Repository System for archiving/sharing

== Using the Repository System ==
LS -> RS : Access repository system
activate RS
RS -> RS : Authenticate LS
RS --> LS : Provides access to RS dashboard

== Archiving Research ==
LS -> RS : Select "Archive Research"
RS -> RS : Display archiving options
RS --> LS : Guided archiving process

== Setting Up Sharing Preferences ==
LS -> RS : Configure sharing settings
activate RS
RS --> LS : Options for public/private sharing, embargoes
deactivate RS

== Meeting DMP Requirements ==
LS -> DMP : Access DMP Tool
activate DMP
LS -> DMP : Enter project details
LS -> DMP : Link repository content
DMP -> RS : Verify repository links
RS --> DMP : Confirmation of links
DMP --> LS : Generates compliant DMP document
deactivate DMP

LS -> R : Provides DMP document and instructions for use
R -> LS : Acknowledges receipt and understanding

This sequence diagram begins with a researcher reaching out to library staff with inquiries about fulfilling DMP requirements, which triggers the library staff to explain the capabilities of Cornell's Repository System for archiving and sharing research outputs. Following this, the library staffer navigates through the process of accessing the repository system, archiving research data, setting up sharing preferences as per DMP requirements, and eventually generating a DMP document using a DMP tool that incorporates the repository system's functionalities. The diagram concludes with the library staff providing the necessary DMP document and instructions to the researcher.

Remember, the actual implementation may involve more detailed steps based on specific functionalities of the Cornell University digital repository system and the DMP tool in use. This diagram is meant to provide a conceptual overview of the process involved in utilizing the repository system for DMP compliance.

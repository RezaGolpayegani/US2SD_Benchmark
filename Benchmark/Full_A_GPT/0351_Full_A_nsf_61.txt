Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML requires illustrating the interactions for identifying and planning visual design-related tasks within a sprint. Below is a PlantUML code that represents such interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Team Member" as TM
participant "Sprint Backlog" as SB
participant "Design & UX Lead" as DUX
participant "Project Manager" as PM
participant "Content Strategy" as CS
participant "Development Team" as DT
database "Task Repository" as TR

TM -> SB : Review current sprint goals
activate SB
SB -> DUX : Identify visual design needs
activate DUX
DUX -> PM : Consult on scope & priorities
activate PM
PM -> DUX : Confirm sprint visual design tasks
deactivate PM
DUX -> CS : Coordinate for brand guidelines alignment
activate CS
CS --> DUX : Confirm alignment
deactivate CS
DUX -> DT : Discuss feasibility and time estimates
activate DT
DT --> DUX : Provide estimates
deactivate DT
DUX -> TR : Update Task Repository with visual design tasks
activate TR
TR --> TM : Notify new tasks added
deactivate TR
deactivate DUX
TM -> TM : Assign tasks to team members

### Explanation:

1. **Team Member (TM) reviews sprint goals**: The process begins with the team member reviewing the goals for the current sprint in the Sprint Backlog.

2. **Identify visual design needs**: The team member then consults with the Design & UX Lead to identify what specific visual design tasks are necessary for the sprint.

3. **Consult on scope & priorities**: The Design & UX Lead consults with the Project Manager to understand the scope and priorities for the sprintâ€™s visual design tasks.

4. **Confirm sprint visual design tasks**: The Project Manager confirms which tasks should be prioritized and included in the sprint.

5. **Coordinate for brand guidelines alignment**: The Design & UX Lead works with Content Strategy to ensure all visual design tasks align with the brand guidelines.

6. **Discuss feasibility and time estimates**: The Design & UX Lead discusses the feasibility and solicits time estimates from the Development Team for implementing the visual designs.

7. **Update Task Repository with visual design tasks**: Once tasks are defined and estimated, they are added to the Task Repository.

8. **Notify new tasks added**: The Task Repository notifies the initiating team member that new visual design tasks have been added.

9. **Assign tasks to team members**: Finally, the team member assigns the new visual design tasks to the relevant team members.

By following these steps, the team can ensure that visual design tasks are properly planned, assigned, and aligned with the project's sprint goals and brand guidelines.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to create reports on what type of books are borrowed the most" using PlantUML, you would describe the interactions between the components like the Manager, System Interface, Reporting Module, and Database. 

The sequence diagram will show the steps taken by a library manager to request and receive a report on the most borrowed book types.

Here's an example of how you might write this in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant "System Interface" as systemInterface
participant "Reporting Module" as reportingModule
participant "Database" as database

manager -> systemInterface : Request most borrowed book types report
activate systemInterface

systemInterface -> reportingModule : Fetch report data
activate reportingModule

reportingModule -> database : Query borrowed books data
activate database

database --> reportingModule : Return borrowed books data
deactivate database

reportingModule -> reportingModule : Process data to find most borrowed types
reportingModule --> systemInterface : Return report result
deactivate reportingModule

systemInterface --> manager : Display report
deactivate systemInterface

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram code delineates a simple flow:
1. The Manager initiates a request through the System Interface to get a report on the most borrowed book types.
2. The System Interface forwards this request to the Reporting Module.
3. The Reporting Module then queries the Database to fetch data on all borrowed books.
4. The Database returns this data to the Reporting Module.
5. The Reporting Module processes this data to ascertain the most frequently borrowed book types.
6. Finally, the process result (the report) is sent back through the System Interface to the Manager.

Remember, this diagram is simplified for clarity and to illustrate the concept; depending on your exact requirements and system design, additional details or steps might be necessary.

To craft a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a user, I want to identify brands in videos and receive related information about them," we need to outline interactions between various components such as the User, the User Interface (UI), the Content Identification System, and potentially a Database or External APIs that hold brand information. Below is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram illustrating these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "UI" as UI
participant "Content Identification\nSystem" as CIS
participant "Brand Information\nDatabase" as DB
participant "External Brand API" as API

User -> UI : Upload video/search for video
UI -> CIS : Initiate brand identification in video
CIS -> DB : Query for known brands
alt Brand found in Database
    DB -> CIS : Return brand details
else Brand not found in Database
    CIS -> API : Request brand information
    API -> CIS : Return brand details
end
CIS -> UI : Display brand information
UI -> User : Show brand details and related information

### Explanation
1. **User**: The user starts the process by either uploading a video or searching for a video within the platform through the User Interface (UI).
2. **UI (User Interface)**: Acts as the mediator between the user and the platform's backend systems. It sends the user's request for brand identification in the selected video to the Content Identification System.
3. **Content Identification System (CIS)**: This system processes the video to identify any brands shown or mentioned. It first queries an internal Brand Information Database to check if the identified brand information is already known.
4. **Brand Information Database (DB)**: Contains details about various brands that the platform has previously encountered. If the brand is found, it sends the details back to the CIS. If not, the CIS then reaches out to an External Brand API.
5. **External Brand API (API)**: An external service that provides detailed information about a wide range of brands, including those not currently in the platform's database. It is queried if the internal database does not have the information.
6. **Content Identification System (CIS)**: Upon receiving the brand details, either from the internal database or the external API, the CIS then sends this information back to the UI.
7. **UI (User Interface)**: Finally, it presents the results to the user, displaying the identified brand(s) in the video and any related information it has retrieved.

This sequence diagram is a simplified representation and can be expanded based on more detailed requirements, including error handling, user feedback mechanisms, and more complex interactions that might involve analyzing video content in real-time or integrating with additional data sources for enhanced insights.

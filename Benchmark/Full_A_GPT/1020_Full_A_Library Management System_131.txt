Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a library manager wants to see books by authors requires capturing the interactions among various components in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). The process involves querying the system for books by a specific author and displaying the results to the library manager, potentially highlighting any known gaps in the author's bibliography that the library's collection might have.

Here's how you can represent this process in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant LibraryManager as LM
participant WebInterface as WI
participant CLMSServer as CS
participant Database as DB

LM -> WI : Enter author's name and request books list
activate WI
WI -> CS : Request books by author
activate CS
CS -> DB : Query books by author name
activate DB
DB --> CS : Return book list
destroy DB
CS --> WI : Display books by author
deactivate CS
WI --> LM : Show list of books by author
deactivate WI
LM -> WI : Request missing books check
activate WI
WI -> CS : Initiate missing books check for author
activate CS
CS -> DB : Query for author's complete bibliography
activate DB
DB --> CS : Return complete bibliography
deactivate DB
CS -> CS : Compare author's bibliography with library collection
CS --> WI : Display missing books
deactivate CS
WI --> LM : Show missing books by author
deactivate WI

This sequence diagram outlines the basic interactions:

1. **Library Manager Request:** The library manager (LM) starts by entering the author's name into the Web Interface (WI) and requests a list of books by that author.
2. **Request Handling:** The Web Interface forwards the request to the CLMS Server (CS), which queries the Database (DB) for books by the specified author.
3. **Display Results:** The list of books by the author is returned from the Database to the CLMS Server, then to the Web Interface, and finally displayed to the Library Manager.
4. **Check for Missing Books:** The Library Manager requests a check for any missing books by the author. 
5. **Missing Books Check:** The Web Interface sends this request to the CLMS Server, which then queries the Database for the complete bibliography of the author.
6. **Comparison and Result:** The CLMS Server compares the complete bibliography with the library's collection, identifies any missing books, and sends this information back to the Web Interface, which displays the missing books to the Library Manager.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the necessary components and interactions to support the library manager's goal of checking for any missing books by a specific author within the Comprehensive Library Management System.

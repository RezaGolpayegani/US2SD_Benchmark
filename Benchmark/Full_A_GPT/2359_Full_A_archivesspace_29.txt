Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story focuses on an Archivist importing Electronic Archival Description (EAD) files previously exported by the Archivists' Toolkit into the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS). The diagram will illustrate the interactions between the Archivist (user), the CAMS Interface, a File Upload Manager, a Data Validation Module, and a Database.

Given the complexity of the process and the limitations of text format, I'll sketch out a simplified version of what this sequence might look like in PlantUML syntax. This example assumes a web-based interface for the CAMS where the Archivist can upload EAD files, which are then validated and imported into the system’s database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant "CAMS Interface" as Interface
participant "File Upload Manager" as UploadManager
participant "Data Validation Module" as ValidationModule
participant "Database" as DB

Archivist -> Interface : Select EAD file(s) for upload
Interface -> UploadManager : Initiate file upload
UploadManager -> UploadManager : Check file type and size
alt If file is valid
    UploadManager -> ValidationModule : Send file for validation
    loop For each record in EAD file
        ValidationModule -> ValidationModule : Validate record structure and content
    end
    alt If validation passes
        ValidationModule --> DB : Import records into database
        DB --> ValidationModule : Send import success confirmation
        ValidationModule --> Interface : Display success message to Archivist
    else Validation fails
        ValidationModule --> Interface : Display error messages
    end
else If file is invalid
    UploadManager --> Interface : Display file invalid error
end
Archivist <- Interface : Receives confirmation/error message

This sequence diagram starts with the Archivist selecting the EAD files to be uploaded via the CAMS Interface. The files are passed to the File Upload Manager, which checks the file types and sizes. If the files meet the specific criteria, they are sent to the Data Validation Module to validate the structure and content of each record within the EAD files. If the records pass validation, they are imported into the system’s database, which in turn confirms the successful import back to the Data Validation Module and subsequently notifies the CAMS Interface to inform the Archivist. Any errors during file validation or import would be communicated back to the Archivist through the interface.

This sequence diagram represents a high-level overview. Actual implementations may require handling additional complexities such as batch processing large files, detailed error logging, and complex validation scenarios that involve cross-referencing existing database records.

Certainly! Below is a simplified sequence diagram example in PlantUML format for the User Story: "As a manager, I want to display total sales by date." This outlines the interaction process between the manager, the Restaurant Management and Operations System (back-end server), and the database when a manager requests to view the total sales for a specific date.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Restaurant Management \nand Operations System" as System
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> System : Request total sales for a specific date
activate System

System -> DB : Query total sales by date
activate DB

DB --> System : Return sales data
deactivate DB

System -> System : Process and summarize sales data
System --> Manager : Display total sales
deactivate System

@enduml
```

This diagram assumes a simplified interaction where:

1. **Manager**: Initiates the action by requesting the total sales for a specific date through the system's user interface.
2. **Restaurant Management and Operations System (System)**: Represents the server's backend that receives the request, processes it, and interacts with the database.
3. **Database (DB)**: Stores all sales transactions and is queried by the system for total sales on the specified date.
4. **Process Flow**:
   - The Manager sends a request for total sales on a specified date.
   - The System formulates a query and requests the information from the Database.
   - The Database returns the sales data for the requested date back to the System.
   - The System processes and summarizes the sales data.
   - The System displays the total sales to the Manager.

This example focuses on backend processing and assumes a clean and user-friendly interface exists for the manager to make such requests. Depending on the complexity of your application and the granularity of your design, you may want to include error handling, security measures (like authentication and authorization checks), and more detailed processing steps in your implementation.

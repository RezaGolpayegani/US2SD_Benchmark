Given the complexity of generating a detailed sequence diagram directly in text format, below is a simplified outline of a PlantUML code for a sequence diagram based on the given user story. This outline focuses on the interaction between a researcher and the system components involved in determining the digitization date of an item within a digital archive management system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Search Service" as Search
database "Archive Database" as DB

Researcher -> Web: Accesses digital archive
activate Web

Web -> Search: Request to view item
activate Search

Search -> DB: Query item metadata
activate DB

DB -> Search: Return metadata including digitization date
deactivate DB

Search -> Web: Display item details
deactivate Search

Web -> Researcher: Show item details including digitization date
deactivate Web

```

Explanation of the steps:
1. **Researcher Accesses digital archive**: This initiates the process when a researcher accesses the digital archive through the web interface.
2. **Web Interface requests item viewing**: The web interface, upon receiving the researcher's request to view an item, passes this request to the search service.
3. **Search Service queries Archive Database**: The search service then communicates with the archive database to retrieve the metadata of the requested item.
4. **Archive Database returns metadata**: The archive database finds the requested item and sends back its metadata, including the digitization date.
5. **Search Service displays item details**: The search service processes the received metadata and sends the relevant information, including the digitization date, back to the web interface.
6. **Web Interface shows item details to Researcher**: Finally, the web interface presents the item details to the researcher, highlighting the digitization date.

This workflow highlights how a digital archive management system could enable a researcher to find out the date on which an item was digitized, thus providing insight into the item's digital history and potentially its relevance to the researcher's work.

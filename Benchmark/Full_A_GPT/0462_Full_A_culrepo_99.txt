Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the scenario where an asset manager wants to ensure that threats to copies in one repository do not automatically affect redundant copies involves illustrating the interactions between the asset manager, the digital repository system, and potentially other external systems or services designed to safeguard the integrity of the data. Given the complexity and need for simplicity, the sequence will focus on core interactions.

Below is a simple PlantUML code snippet that depicts these interactions. For the sake of this diagram, we're assuming a simplified process that checks the integrity of copies in multiple repositories and isolates the threat if detected.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AssetManager as AM
participant DigitalRepositorySystem as DRS
participant RedundancyService as RS
participant ThreatDetectionService as TDS
participant NotificationService as NS

AM -> DRS : RequestIntegrityCheck()
DRS -> RS : FetchRedundantCopiesLocations()
RS --> DRS : RedundantCopiesDetails
DRS -> TDS : CheckCopiesIntegrity(RedundantCopiesDetails)
TDS -> TDS : AnalyzeCopies()
alt Threat Detected
    TDS -> DRS : ThreatNotification(ThreatDetails)
    DRS -> RS : IsolateCopy(ThreatenedCopyDetails)
    RS --> DRS : IsolationConfirmation
    DRS -> NS : SendAlert(AM, ThreatDetails)
    NS --> AM : ThreatAlertMsg
else No Threat Detected
    TDS --> DRS : AllCopiesSecure
    DRS -> NS : SendConfirmation(AM)
    NS --> AM : AllCopiesSecuredMsg
end

This diagram simplifies the process into several main steps:

1. **Request Integrity Check**: The asset manager initiates a request to the digital repository system for an integrity check on the redundant copies.
2. **Fetch Redundant Copies Locations**: The digital repository system asks the redundancy service for the locations/details of the redundant copies.
3. **Check Copies Integrity**: The digital repository system then passes these details to the threat detection service to analyze the integrity of each copy.
4. **Analyze and Isolate Threat**: If the threat detection service finds a threat in any of the copies, it notifies the digital repository system. The system, in turn, instructs the redundancy service to isolate the threatened copy. A threat alert message is then sent to the asset manager.
5. **Confirmation of Secured Copies**: If no threats are detected, a confirmation message is sent directly to the asset manager indicating all copies are secure.

Please, note that the actual implementation can be significantly more complex with additional steps including but not limited to authentication, more intricate interactions between services, and detailed error handling processes. This diagram intends to provide a high-level overview suitable for the scope described in the user story.

Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a Staff, I want to delete a book, so that I can update the library when a book is removed from the library." This sequence diagram encompasses interactions among system components like the User Interface (UI), Backend Controller, Authentication Service, Book Management Service, and Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff as staff
participant "UI: Library Management" as ui
participant "Backend Controller" as controller
participant "Authentication Service" as authService
participant "Book Management Service" as bookService
database "Library Database" as db

== Delete Book Flow ==

staff -> ui : Selects Delete Book Option
ui -> controller : Request to delete book (bookId)
controller -> authService : Validate Staff Credentials
alt Authentication Success
    authService --> controller : Credentials Valid
    controller -> bookService : Delete Book Request (bookid)
    bookService -> db : Delete Book Record
    db --> bookService : Confirm Deletion
    bookService --> controller : Book Deleted Successfully
    controller --> ui : Display Success Message
    staff <-- ui : Views Confirmation Message
else Authentication Failure
    authService --> controller : Authentication Failed
    controller --> ui : Display Error Message (Unauthorized)
    staff <-- ui : Views Error Message
end

```

Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Staff Interaction:** The staff (librarian/library employee) initiates the process by selecting the option to delete a book from the library's UI.

2. **Request Forwarding:** The UI then forwards this request, along with the identification of the book to be deleted (bookId), to the backend controller.

3. **Authentication Check:** The backend controller interacts with the authentication service to validate the credentials of the staffer to ensure only authorized persons can delete books.

4. **Conditional Flow:**
    - **Authentication Success**: If the authentication succeeds, the flow continues with the book management service, which then proceeds to delete the book's record from the database. Upon successful deletion, the confirmation is sent up the chain, and a success message is displayed to the staff.
    - **Authentication Failure**: If the authentication fails, an error message indicating unauthorized access is displayed to the staff.

5. **Deletion & Feedback:** Finally, upon successful deletion, the staff receives confirmation that the book has been removed from the library's catalog.

This sequence diagram outlines a comprehensive flow for deleting a book, encompassing essential elements like authentication and direct manipulation of book records, ensuring that the operation is performed securely and efficiently.

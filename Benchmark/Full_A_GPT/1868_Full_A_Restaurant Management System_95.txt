Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to add items to the copy to the menu so that I will be able to enrich the menu content whenever I want" requires outlining the interactions between different system components and the manager. Although I can't directly generate images or interactive diagrams here, I can provide you with a PlantUML format sequence diagram that you can run in any PlantUML editor or compatible tool. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Authorization Service" as AS
participant "Menu Management Service" as MMS
database "Menu Database" as MDB

Manager -> MI: Accesses Management Interface
MI -> AS: Request Authorization
AS --> MI: Authorization Granted
Manager -> MI: Selects "Add Menu Item"
MI -> MMS: Send Addition Request
MMS -> MDB: Create New Menu Item Entry
MDB --> MMS: Confirm Item Added
MMS --> MI: Confirm Addition to Manager
MI --> Manager: Display "Item Successfully Added"

### Explanation:
1. **Manager and Management Interface (MI):** The manager accesses the Management Interface, a part of the front-end application where they can manage menu items.
2. **Authorization Service (AS):** The Management Interface requests authorization from the Authorization Service to ensure that the manager has the necessary permissions to add menu items.
3. **Manager Adds Menu Item:** Assuming authorization is granted, the manager selects the option to add a new menu item, usually by filling out a form with the item's details (name, ingredients, price, etc.).
4. **Menu Management Service (MMS):** The Management Interface communicates with the Menu Management Service on the backend, sending the new menu item data.
5. **Menu Database (MDB):** The Menu Management Service creates a new entry in the Menu Database for the new item.
6. **Confirmation of Addition:** Once the item is successfully added to the database, the Menu Management Service sends a confirmation message back to the Management Interface, which subsequently informs the manager that the item was successfully added.

This sequence diagram simplifies the process to focus on the main interactions and assumes that proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms are in place for a smooth manager experience.

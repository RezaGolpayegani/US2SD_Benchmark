To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the net profit of the month," we'll outline the primary steps and interactions between the system components and then translate these interactions into PlantUML code. The interactions for this user story typically involve the manager requesting the net profit report, the system processing this request by fetching transaction and expense data, calculating the net profit, and then displaying the results.

Let's break down these interactions:

1. **Manager initiates request**: The manager accesses the reporting feature to request the net profit for a specific month.
2. **System fetches transactions**: The system queries the database to retrieve all sales transactions for the specified month.
3. **System fetches expenses**: Concurrently, the system also retrieves data on all expenses incurred during the same period.
4. **Calculate net profit**: The system calculates the net profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total sales.
5. **Display result**: The system then presents the net profit figure to the manager.

Now, let's translate this scenario into PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as m
participant "Reporting System" as rs
database "Database" as db

m -> rs : Request net profit for the month
rs -> db : Fetch sales transactions
db --> rs : Sales transactions data
rs -> db : Fetch expenses
db --> rs : Expenses data
rs -> rs : Calculate net profit
rs --> m : Display net profit
@endwhile
@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram code outlines the interactions starting from the manager's request down to displaying the calculated net profit. The sequence underscores the process flow and collaboration between the manager, the reporting system component, and the database.

To visualize the diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment (like an online editor or a plugin for your code editor) and paste this code. The diagram visually conveys the manager's interaction with the system to obtain the monthly net profit, highlighting the system's internal processes to fulfill the request.

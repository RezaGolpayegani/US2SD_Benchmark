To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a DAMS manager, I want to know if copyrighted content has an applicable license," we'll need to outline the interactions between the DAMS Manager and the various components of the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS) as specified in the project description. 

Given the nature of UML diagrams and the text-based limitations here, I'll provide you with a PlantUML format sequence diagram that represents these interactions. This example assumes the DAMS Manager begins by querying the system about a specific piece of content to check if a valid license is associated with it. The process involves the DAMS Manager, the DIMS system with its user interface, database, and possibly an external copyright information service if the system checks copyrights and licenses not just internally but also against an external authority or database.

This sequence diagram is simplified for clarity and to fit within the framework provided:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "DAMS Manager" as manager
participant "DIMS User Interface" as ui
participant "DIMS Backend" as backend
participant "DIMS Database" as database
participant "External Copyright Service" as copyright

manager -> ui : Request license info for content
ui -> backend : Query license for content ID
backend -> database : Check content license
database -> backend : Return license details
alt License Details Found
    backend -> manager : Display license info
else License Details Not Found
    backend -> copyright : Query external license
    copyright -> backend : Return external license info
    alt External License Info Found
        backend -> database : Update license info
        database -> backend : Confirm update
        backend -> manager : Display updated license info
    else No External License Info Found
        backend -> manager : Display no license found message
    end
end

### Explanation:
1. **DAMS Manager Initiates Request:** The DAMS Manager starts the process by looking for copyright and license information for a particular piece of digital content through the DIMS User Interface.

2. **DIMS System Processes Request:** The request is relayed to the backend, which in turn queries the DIMS database for any associated license information related to the queried content.

3. **Database Response:** The database responds with the license details if it has them.

4. **License Information Presentation:** If license details are found within the internal database, they are displayed to the DAMS Manager.

5. **External License Check (if needed):** In scenario where the internal database doesn't contain license details, the system checks with an external copyright service for relevant information.

6. **External License Information Handling:** If external license info is found, it gets updated in the DIMS database and then presented to the DAMS Manager. If no information is found externally, the DAMS Manager is informed that no license information is available.

This sequence accounts for both internal checks within the DIMS and possible external verification, aligning with the project description's emphasis on comprehensive copyright and rights management.

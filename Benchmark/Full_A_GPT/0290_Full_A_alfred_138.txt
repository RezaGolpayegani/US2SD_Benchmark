Creating a detailed sequence diagram for an ALFRED API from the described user story involves mapping out how a developer interacts with the API to reduce their workload. Given the various functionalities outlined in ALFRED, we'll focus on one scenario where a developer aims to integrate a new health monitoring feature into their app using the ALFRED API. This example will showcase API interaction for registering a third-party application, sending health data, and receiving notifications.

Let's craft the PlantUML code to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Developer Portal" as Portal
participant "ALFRED API" as API
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Health Data Service" as HealthData
participant "Notification Service" as Notification

Developer -> Portal: Access Developer Portal
Portal -> Developer: Display API Documentation

Developer -> API: Request API Key
API -> Auth: Validate Developer Account
Auth -> API: Confirm Authentication
API -> Developer: Provide API Key

Developer -> HealthData: Send Health Data using API Key
alt successful data submission
    HealthData -> Developer: Acknowledge Receipt
else failure in data submission
    HealthData -> Developer: Error Message
end

Developer -> Notification: Subscribe to Health Alerts
Notification -> Developer: Confirm Subscription

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the developer accessing the ALFRED Developer Portal to read through the API documentation. Next, the developer requests an API key by interacting with the ALFRED API, which authenticates the developer via an Authentication Service before providing an API Key.

With the API Key, the developer sends health data to the ALFRED system, specifically targeting a Health Data Service. Upon a successful submission, the service acknowledges receipt of the data. If the submission fails, an error message is returned instead.

Finally, the developer subscribes to health alert notifications, and this action is confirmed by the Notification Service, ensuring the developer's app stays informed of relevant health events related to their application's users.

This diagram illustrates a straightforward interaction flow that enables a developer to leverage the ALFRED API to enhance their application, aligning with the project's focus on ease of use and expansion capabilities.

To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for your user story "As a user, I want to either keep a logbook entry private or share it with individuals rather than groups", we will follow a sequence of actions that illustrate the functionality from the perspective of the platform (Neurohub), the user, and other entities involved such as the database or a sharing service. This diagram aims to capture the flow of interaction when a user decides whether to keep a logbook entry private or share it with specific individuals.

Please note, the below PlantUML code is a basic representation and will need to be adjusted or extended based on your specific system architecture, the technologies involved, and detailed functionality of the Neurohub platform.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant User
participant "Neurohub Interface" as Interface
database "Neurohub Database" as Database
participant "Sharing Service" as Sharing

User -> Interface: Choose logbook entry
Interface -> User: Display logbook entry options
User -> Interface: Select "Set Privacy"
Interface -> User: Display Privacy Options (Private, Share with individuals)
User -> Interface: Choose Privacy Setting
alt if user chooses Private
    Interface -> Database: Mark entry as Private
    Database -> Interface: Confirm change
    Interface -> User: Display confirmation message
else if user chooses to Share with individuals
    Interface -> User: Show individuals selection
    User -> Interface: Select individuals to share with
    Interface -> Sharing: Process sharing with selected individuals
    Sharing -> Database: Update sharing settings
    Database -> Sharing: Confirm update
    Sharing -> Interface: Confirm sharing processed
    Interface -> User: Display sharing confirmation message
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the user interacting with the Neurohub Interface to select a logbook entry. The user is then given the option to set the privacy of this entry. Depending on the user's choice (keeping it private or sharing with specific individuals), the diagram branches into two possible sequences of interactions:

1. **Private Option**: If the user chooses to keep the logbook entry private, the Neurohub Interface updates this preference in the Neurohub Database, which then confirms the change back to the Interface, followed by a confirmation message to the user.

2. **Sharing Option**: If the user opts to share the logbook entry with specific individuals, the user selects the individuals from a provided list. The sharing settings are processed, with updates made to the database to reflect these preferences. Confirmation of the sharing process is sent back to the user through the Interface.

This representation encapsulates the sequence of interactions in a simplified format. Depending on the actual complexity of Neurohub's systems, more entities and interactions may be necessary to fully capture the entire process accurately.

Creating a PlantUML sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interactions between different actors and the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) system to determine data security for compliance purposes. The user story focuses on a funder's need to assess the security measures of data to ensure compliance with legal standards.

Below is a basic outline for a Plant UML sequence diagram to represent these interactions. This example is quite high level and focuses on the main steps a funder might take to evaluate data security through the DMPTool. This does not capture every possible system interaction or function due to the complexity and the broad scope of the DMPTool described.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Funder
participant "DMPTool" as DMP
participant "SecurityAssessmentModule" as SAM
participant "ComplianceDatabase" as CD
participant "ProjectData" as PD
participant "ReportGenerator" as RG

Funder -> DMP : Request security details\nfor specific project
DMP -> SAM : Assess security measures\nand standards
activate SAM
SAM -> PD : Fetch relevant data\nsecurity protocols
PD -> SAM : Return security protocols
SAM -> CD : Verify compliance\nwith legal standards
CD -> SAM : Return compliance status
deactivate SAM
SAM -> RG : Compile security\nassessment report
RG -> DMP : Generate and format\nreport
DMP -> Funder : Provide report on\ndata security and compliance

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram
1. **Funder initiates a request**: The process starts with the funder requesting information on the security measures of specific data to ensure legal compliance.
2. **DMPTool assesses**: DMPTool forwards this request to the Security Assessment Module (SAM), which is responsible for assessing security measures and standards.
3. **Security protocols fetched**: SAM queries the project data for relevant security protocols that are in place.
4. **Verification with compliance standards**: SAM then checks these security protocols against a Compliance Database to ensure they meet legal and ethical standards.
5. **Compilation of the report**: Upon verifying compliance, SAM compiles a detailed report highlighting the security measures and their compliance status.
6. **Report generation**: This report is then formatted appropriately by the Report Generator.
7. **Funder receives the report**: Finally, the DMPTool provides the funder with the report, giving them the needed assurance regarding data security and legal compliance.

This simplified diagram and explanation aim to convey the essential steps as per the described user story, focusing on the interactions associated with assessing and reporting on data security for legal compliance purposes.

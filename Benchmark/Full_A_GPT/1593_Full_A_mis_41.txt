Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves representing objects or entities and the interactions between them. Since the focus is on viewing dashboard statistics about collections, we can identify the following entities as participants in the scenario:

- **User (Repository Manager)**
- **Dashboard UI**
- **Collections Management Service**
- **Storage Service**
- **Statistics Service**

Below is a PlantUML code that represents the sequence diagram for the specified user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as RM
participant "Dashboard UI" as UI
participant "Collections Management Service" as CMS
participant "Storage Service" as SS
participant "Statistics Service" as STS

RM -> UI: Request to view dashboard
activate UI

UI -> CMS: Get list of collections
activate CMS
CMS --> UI: Return list of collections
deactivate CMS

UI -> STS: Request statistics for each collection
activate STS

loop for each collection
    STS -> CMS: Get number of items in collection
    CMS --> STS: Return item count

    STS -> SS: Get storage consumed by collection
    SS --> STS: Return storage size
end

STS --> UI: Return statistics (items, storage, activity visualization)
deactivate STS

UI -> RM: Display dashboard with statistics
deactivate UI
@enduml
```

In this diagram:

1. **User (Repository Manager)** initiates the request to view dashboard statistics about the collections.
2. **Dashboard UI** acts as the interface that handles user requests and displays the data.
3. **Collections Management Service** manages operations related to fetching collections and their metadata.
4. **Storage Service** is responsible for providing information about the storage consumed by each collection.
5. **Statistics Service** gathers and compiles statistics such as the number of items and the total storage consumed by each collection, as well as visualizations of deposit activity.

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates a simplified view of the interactions needed to fulfill the user story. Complexities like error handling, authentication, and parallel data processing for efficiency are not represented in this high-level view.

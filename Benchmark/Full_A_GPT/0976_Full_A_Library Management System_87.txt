Generating a detailed Plan UML sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see late returns" involves outlining the interactions between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management	setq System (CLMS) as the librarian queries and receives data on books that have been returned late. This example focuses on the interactions between the librarian, the system interface, the database, and notification services.

Given the nature of text responses here, I'll describe the Plan UML code for you, but please note that you'll need to integrate it into your Plan UML environment to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Web Interface" as web
database "Database" as db
participant "Notification System" as notify

librarian -> web : Select "Late Returns" option
web -> db : Query overdue books
db -> web : Return list of overdue books
web -> librarian : Display overdue books list
librarian -> web : Request to send reminders
web -> notify : Trigger overdue notices
notify -> db : Lookup borrower contact info
db -> notify : Return contact info
notify -> librarian : Confirm notifications sent

**Explanation:**

1. **Librarian as actor**: Initiates the process by selecting the option to view books that have been returned late through the system's web interface.

2. **Web Interface**: Acts as the middleman between the librarian and the database, handling the request to view late returns and later to send reminders.

3. **Database**: Stores and manages all data related to books, borrow dates, due dates, and member contact information. It processes queries from the web interface and returns the requested data.

4. **Notification System**: Handles the generation and dispatch of notifications (e.g., email or SMS) to borrowers with overdue books, upon request from the web interface.

In this flow, the librarian queries the system for any books that have been returned past their due date. The system fetches and displays this information. Following this, the librarian can decide to send out reminders to the borrowers, triggering the notification system to send these reminders based on the contact information stored in the database.

To represent the user story of a library staff member who wants to create a collection with custom metadata fields for wider distribution in a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax, here's an example:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryStaff as "Library Staff"
participant BrowserInterface as "Web Interface"
participant ServerSideApplication as "Server Application"
participant Database as "Database"

LibraryStaff -> BrowserInterface : Access collection creation form
BrowserInterface -> ServerSideApplication : Request collection creation form
ServerSideApplication -> BrowserInterface : Return collection creation form

LibraryStaff -> BrowserInterface : Fill and submit form with custom metadata fields
BrowserInterface -> ServerSideApplication : Submit collection creation request with custom metadata
ServerSideApplication -> Database : Validate and save collection data
activate Database
Database --> ServerSideApplication : Confirm collection saved
deactivate Database

ServerSideApplication -> BrowserInterface : Display success message to Library Staff
BrowserInterface -> LibraryStaff : Show success message & collection details

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the library staff accessing the collection creation form through a web interface. The server application then provides the collection creation form to the staff member. Once the form is filled out with necessary information, including custom metadata fields, it's submitted back through the web interface to the server application. The server application processes this request, ensuring the validity and then saving the new collection data in the database. Upon successful creation of the collection, the server application informs the web interface, which in turn notifies the library staff with a success message and the details of the newly created collection.

Remember, this is a simplification to fit the user story into a sequence diagram and might not cover all components and error handling that a real-world implementation would require.

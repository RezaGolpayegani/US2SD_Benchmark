Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see unfulfilled orders" involves illustrating the interaction among various system components, such as the manager's interface, the backend server, and the database. Since providing a fully rendered sequence diagram isn't possible in text format, below is a PlantUML code that represents how these components interact to fulfill this specific user story.

To visualize the sequence diagram, you will need to use a UML tool that supports PlantUML syntax, such as an IDE plugin or an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant ManagerInterface as MI
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

title Manager Viewing Unfulfilled Orders

autonumber

MI -> BS : Request unfulfilled orders
BS -> DB : Query unfulfilled orders
DB --> BS : Return order data
BS --> MI : Display unfulfilled orders

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **ManagerInterface (MI):** This represents the graphical user interface (GUI) where the manager interacts with the system. It could be a web page or an application screen specifically designed for management functionalities.

2. **BackendServer (BS):** This component processes the request from the manager's interface. It handles the logic needed to retrieve the necessary information from the database.

3. **Database (DB):** This stores all the data related to orders, including which are fulfilled and which are still pending.

**Sequence of Events:**

- The process begins when the manager requests to see unfulfilled orders from the management interface (MI), signaling the backend server (BS).
- The backend server (BS) then queries the database (DB) for orders that are marked as unfulfilled or pending.
- The database (DB) processes this query and returns the relevant order data to the backend server (BS).
- Finally, the backend server (BS) processes this data to a displayable format and sends it back to the manager's interface (MI), where the manager can review the unfulfilled orders.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions needed for a manager to view unfulfilled orders within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. The actual implementation details, such as the specific queries made to the database or the way the data is displayed on the manager interface, may vary based on the system design and requirements.

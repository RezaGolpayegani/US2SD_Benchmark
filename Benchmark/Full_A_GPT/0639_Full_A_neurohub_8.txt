Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the provided project description and user story would involve illustrating the interactions between the systems administrator and the components of the Ubuntu system, primarily focusing on the package management aspect for installing Neurohub dependencies. Given the context and aiming to align closely with the objectives outlined in your project description, the sequence might unfold as follows:

Please note that Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is significantly outdated. Typically, modern software projects would target more current versions of operating systems. However, for the sake of this example, we will proceed as if Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is the required environment.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant SystemsAdministrator as admin
participant "Ubuntu Package Management System" as apt
participant "Software Repository" as repo
participant "Neurohub Dependencies" as dependencies

admin -> apt: search for Neurohub dependencies
apt -> repo: query available packages
repo --> apt: return list of packages (Neurohub dependencies)
apt --> admin: display available Neurohub dependencies

admin -> apt: select required dependencies
apt -> dependencies: download selected dependencies
dependencies -> apt: validate and install dependencies
apt --> admin: confirm successful installation

admin -> apt: verify installation
apt -> dependencies: check installation status
dependencies --> apt: return installation details
apt --> admin: display installation summary (Success/Failure)

```

This diagram starts with the Systems Administrator querying the Ubuntu Package Management System (using `apt` or similar) to find and install the necessary dependencies for Neurohub on an Ubuntu 10.04 LTS machine. The sequence includes searching for available packages, selecting the required dependencies, downloading and installing these dependencies, and finally, verifying the installation.

Keep in mind, the focus here is on depicting a high-level sequence for dependency installation using the package management system. In practice, the actual commands and interactions might be more complex and detailed, involving specific package names, version considerations, and potential conflict resolution steps. Additionally, the usage of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is purely illustrative; for real projects, you would almost certainly be using a much more recent version of Ubuntu or another Linux distribution.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the number of orders taken by each waiter on a daily basis so that I can measure the performance of employees." using PlantUML, you would follow these steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Server Module" as SM
participant Database as DB

M -> MI : Access report feature
activate MI
MI -> SM : Request order count per waiter
activate SM

SM -> DB : Query orders by waiter\nand date
activate DB
DB --> SM : Return order counts
deactivate DB

SM --> MI : Send order counts data
deactivate SM
MI -> M : Display order count report
deactivate MI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the manager (user), the management interface, the server module that processes the report requests, and the database where all order data is stored. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Manager to Management Interface**: The manager accesses the reporting feature in the management interface, indicating the desire to see the daily order count per waiter.

2. **Management Interface to Server Module**: The management interface sends a request to the server module to fetch the order counts per waiter for a given day. This step encapsulates the processing logic and any necessary business rules to generate such reports.

3. **Server Module to Database**: The server module queries the database for orders, grouping them by waiter and filtering by the date to focus only on the daily basis as requested.

4. **Database to Server Module**: The database processes the query and returns the order counts to the server module. This involves accessing the stored data to compute the required information effectively.

5. **Server Module to Management Interface**: With the data retrieved from the database, the server module sends the order counts back to the management interface. This step typically involves formatting the data for easy consumption by the end user.

6. **Management Interface to Manager**: Finally, the management interface presents the order count report to the manager. This visualization allows the manager to assess the performance of each waiter in terms of the number of orders taken.

Note: This sequence diagram assumes a straightforward interaction flow and does not account for possible errors or authentication processes for simplicity. Depending on the system's complexity, additional steps like authentication, error handling, and more detailed interactions might be necessary.

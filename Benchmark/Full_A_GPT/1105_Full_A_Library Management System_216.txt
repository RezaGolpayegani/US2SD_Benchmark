Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story ("As a manager, I want to see borrowed books so that I can plan strategies for genre.") involves illustrating the interactions between the manager, the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the underlying components responsible for retrieving and providing the borrowed books data. Here's how you can represent this interaction in PlantUML format.

Please note, to visualize this diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Library Interface" as LI
participant "Authentication System" as AS
participant "Book Management" as BM
participant "Database" as DB

M -> LI : Request borrowed books report
LI -> AS : Validate manager credentials
AS --> LI : Credentials valid
LI -> BM : Request borrowed books data
BM -> DB : Query borrowed books
DB --> BM : Borrowed books data
BM --> LI : Borrowed books report
LI --> M : Display borrowed books report

@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Manager Requests Report**: The sequence starts with the Manager (M) requesting a borrowed books report through the Library Interface (LI).
2. **Validate Credentials**: The Library Interface then interacts with the Authentication System (AS) to validate the manager's credentials, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive reports.
3. **Fetch Data**: Upon successful validation, the Library Interface requests the borrowed books data from the Book Management (BM) module.
4. **Query Database**: The Book Management module queries the Database (DB) to retrieve the necessary data regarding the borrowed books.
5. **Return Data**: The Database sends the borrowed books data back to the Book Management module, which in turn formats and sends a comprehensive report back to the Library Interface.
6. **Display Report**: Finally, the Library Interface displays the borrowed books report to the Manager, completing the process.

This sequence diagram outlines a straightforward interaction flow focused on the manager's objective to obtain a report on borrowed books for genre strategy planning within the context of the Comprehensive Library Library Management System (CLMS).

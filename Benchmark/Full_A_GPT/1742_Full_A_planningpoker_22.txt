Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the moderator (user), the user interface (UI), and the backend system components necessary for the login process. Below is the PlantUML code that depicts these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Moderator as M
participant LoginForm as LF
participant AuthenticationController as AC
database UserDatabase as DB

M -> LF : Enter account name and password
LF -> AC : Submit login credentials
AC -> DB : Query account details
DB --> AC : Return account details
AC -> AC : Validate credentials
AC --> LF : Login Successful/Failure
LF --> M : Display login status

@enduml
```
**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Moderator (M)**: Represents the inquirer or the user who initiates the login process.
2. **LoginForm (LF)**: This is the user interface or webpage where the moderator inputs their account name and password.
3. **AuthenticationController (AC)**: Acts as the middle-man that handles the login logic. It processes login requests, interacts with the database, and validates credentials.
4. **UserDatabase (DB)**: The database where user credentials and other related information are stored.

**Flow:**

- The login process starts with the **Moderator** entering their account name and password in the **LoginForm**.
- The **LoginForm** submits these credentials to the **AuthenticationController**.
- The **AuthenticationController** queries the **UserDatabase** for the account details corresponding to the provided account name.
- The **UserDatabase** returns the account details to the **AuthenticationController**.
- With the details retrieved from the **UserDatabase**, the **AuthenticationController** validates the credentials (i.e., checks if the provided password matches the one stored in the database).
- Based on the validation outcome, the **AuthenticationController** sends back the login status (successful or failure) to the **LoginForm**.
- Lastly, the **LoginForm** displays the login status to the **Moderator**.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the login process for a moderator wanting to use the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool application. Depending on the specific implementation details and additional security requirements (like OTPs, CAPTCHAs, or 2FA), further interactions might be required.

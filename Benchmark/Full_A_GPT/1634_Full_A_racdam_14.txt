Below is a detailed UML sequence diagram in PlantUML format corresponding to the user story: "As an archivist, I want to have an online form for licensing archival material, so that the process is more transparent and some of the back and forth can be eliminated." This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions involved in using an online form for submitting licensing requests for archival material.

Please note, for rendering this PlantUML code, you would need to set up an environment that supports PlantUML, such as the official PlantUML tool, or integrate it with supported IDEs or documentation tools.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Archivist as archivist
participant "LicensingForm" as formPage
participant "FormValidation" as formValidation
participant "LicensingDB" as licensingDb
participant "NotificationService" as notification
participant "ArchiveManager" as archiveManager

== Archivist Submits Licensing Request ==

archist -> formPage: Access online form
activate formPage

formPage -> archist: Display form fields

archist -> formPage: Fill in and submit form
activate formValidation

formPage -> formValidation: Validate inputs
activate licensingDb

formValidation --> formPage: Validation Success

formPage -> licensingDb: Save licensing request
activate archiveManager

licensingDb --> formPage: Confirmation ID
deactivate licensingDb

formPage -> archist: Show success message and Confirmation ID
deactivate formPage

== Notification Process ==

licensingDb -> notification: Trigger notification
activate notification

notification -> archiveManager: Email notification
deactivate notification

archiveManager -> archist: Approve/Request more info
activate archist

archist -> archiveManager: Provide/Amend info if required
deactivate archist

archiveManager -> licensingDb: Update licensing status
activate licensingDb
deactivate licensingDb

archiveManager -> notification: Send final approval notification
activate notification
deactivate notification

note right of archiveManager: Licensing Process Completed

This PlantUML sequence diagram showcases a simplified process starting from the archivist accessing and submitting the online form, the system validating the form input, saving the licensing request in the database, notifying archive managers, and finally, the negotiation and approval process that might ensue between the archivist and the archive manager. 

Adjustments might be needed based on your exact software architecture and requirements for further details, such as the specific fields in the form, the validation rules, or the backend technology stack handling the form submission and database interactions.

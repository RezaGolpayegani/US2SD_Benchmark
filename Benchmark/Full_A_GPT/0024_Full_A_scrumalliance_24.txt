Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story involves depicting the interaction between entities in the process of a trainer creating a new course or event. This assumes that the system has been designed with separate components handling authentication, user input, database management, and content display. Below is a basic representation in PlantUML format, focusing on this workflow.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Trainer as trainer
participant AuthenticationSystem as auth
participant CourseManagementSystem as cms
participant Database as db
participant UserInterface as ui

trainer -> auth: Authenticate
auth -> trainer: Authentication Success

trainer -> ui: Access Course Creation Page
ui -> trainer: Display Course Creation Form

trainer -> cms: Submit New Course Details
cms -> db: Validate Submission
db -> cms: Confirmation

cms -> db: Store Course Information
db -> cms: Store Confirmation

cms -> ui: Update Course List
ui -> trainer: Display Update Success
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Trainer authenticating themselves through the system before accessing the course creation page. After filling in the new course details in the form provided on the user interface, the trainer submits the information. The Course Management System (CMS) processes this submission, validating and storing the information in the Database. Finally, the system updates the course list visible to the trainer, confirming the successful creation of the new course or event.

Remember, this is a simplified view. Depending on the project's complexity, you might need to account for error handling (e.g., authentication failure, validation errors), interaction with other systems (e.g., notification systems for alerting potential attendees), or additional steps required by the specific business logic (e.g., approval workflows for new courses).

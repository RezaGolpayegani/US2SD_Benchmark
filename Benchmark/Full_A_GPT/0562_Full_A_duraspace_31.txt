Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story *"As a user, I want to know what collection(s) an object belongs to."* in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the user, the system, and any backend services or components responsible for managing the collections and objects within the DAMS (Digital Asset Management System). Below is a basic representation of how this process might be visualized in PlantUML code:

```
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant AuthenticationModule as Auth
participant CollectionManagementSystem as CMS
participant Database as DB

User -> UI: Request info on object's collection
UI -> Auth: Validate user session
Auth --> UI: Session valid

UI -> CMS: Query collection(s) for object
CMS -> DB: Retrieve collection(s) for object
DB --> CMS: Collection data
CMS --> UI: Display collection(s) info
UI --> User: Show collection(s) object belongs to

@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the following steps:
1. **User Initiates Request**: The user requests information on what collection(s) an object belongs to through the User Interface (UI).
2. **Validation**: The UI communicates with the Authentication Module (Auth) to validate the user's session.
3. **Processing Request**: Upon successful validation, the UI requests the information from the Collection Management System (CMS).
4. **Query Execution**: The CMS interacts with the Database (DB) to retrieve information on which collection(s) the specified object belongs to.
5. **Displaying Results**: The CMS returns the collection information to the UI, which then displays it to the user.

This sequence ensures that only authorized users can access collection information and that the system efficiently retrieves and displays the relevant data. Enhancements or adjustments might be needed based on specific requirements, such as handling errors, user permissions, or additional interactions for a more complex or distributed system.

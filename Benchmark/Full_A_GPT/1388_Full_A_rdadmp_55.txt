Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story in Plant UML format involves delineating the steps a Principal Investigator (PI) might go through within the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) to find out who owns the data. This sequence will help illustrate the interactions between the PI, the DMPTool, and possibly other systems or actors involved in determining data ownership. Let's break down the sequence:

1. **Principal Investigator starts the query**: The PI wants to know who owns a specific dataset.
2. **The DMPTool receives the query**: The input is processed, and necessary actions are determined.
3. **DMPTool requests metadata**: The tool may need to fetch metadata associated with the dataset, which includes ownership information.
4. **Metadata tools/internal databases are queried**: If the DMPTool relies on external metadata tools or internal databases for ownership data, it queries these sources.
5. **Data ownership information is retrieved**: The requested information is found and sent back to the DMPTool.
6. **DMPTool presents the information to the PI**: The PI receives the data ownership information through the tool's interface.

Here is how this sequence might be represented in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant PI as "Principal Investigator"
participant DMPTool as "DMPTool"
database MetadataTools as "Metadata Tools/Internal Databases"

PI -> DMPTool : Query data ownership
DMPTool -> MetadataTools : Request metadata for dataset
MetadataTools --> DMPTool : Return dataset metadata\n(includes ownership info)
DMPTool --> PI : Show data ownership information

```

This Plant UML sequence diagram outlines the basic interactions in a streamlined process for a PI to find out who owns a specific dataset through the DMPTool. It accommodates the principal steps, from the initial query to receiving the ownership details. Depending on the complexity of the DMPTool and the breadth of external integrations, additional steps or details could be added to reflect the specific data flow and interactions within the system more accurately.

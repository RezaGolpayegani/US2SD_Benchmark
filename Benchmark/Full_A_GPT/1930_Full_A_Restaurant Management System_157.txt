To create a sequence diagram that details the process of a manager ensuring necessary products and resources are ordered on time, we'll focus on several key steps: the manager requesting product and resource data, the system retrieving this data (including inventory levels and supplier information), and finally, the decision-making process for ordering. Here is a PlantUML code snippet that illustrates this sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "Management System" as System
participant "Inventory Module" as Inventory
participant "Supplier Module" as Supplier
participant "Ordering System" as Ordering

Manager -> System : Request inventory and resource data
activate System

System -> Inventory : Fetch current inventory levels
activate Inventory
Inventory --> System : Inventory data
deactivate Inventory

System -> Supplier : Retrieve supplier details
activate Supplier
Supplier --> System : Supplier data
deactivate Supplier

System --> Manager : Display inventory and supplier data
deactivate System

Manager -> System : Analyze data
activate System
System --> Manager : Indicate items needing restock
deactivate System

Manager -> Ordering : Initiate ordering process
activate Ordering
Ordering -> Inventory : Update inventory levels post-order
activate Inventory
Inventory --> Ordering : Confirm update
deactivate Inventory

Ordering -> Supplier : Place orders with suppliers
activate Supplier
Supplier --> Ordering : Order confirmation
deactivate Supplier

Ordering --> Manager : Confirm successful orders
deactivate Ordering

This sequence diagram starts with the Manager initiating a request to the Management System to fetch current inventory and supplier details. The System then interacts with both the Inventory Module and the Supplier Module to gather the necessary data. Once the data is analyzed, indicating which items need to be restocked, the Manager proceeds with the Ordering System to place orders with suppliers and update inventory levels accordingly.

This process is simplified for visualization purposes. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the system, interactions might involve more steps or additional systems (like analytics for predicting stock depletion or automated alerts for low stock).

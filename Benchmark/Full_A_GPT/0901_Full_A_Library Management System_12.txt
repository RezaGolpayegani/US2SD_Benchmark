To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a customer, I want to see the availability of books," we need to outline the interactions between the customer and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) components such as the web interface, server, database, and potentially other services involved in checking book availability. 

Below is a simplified example of how such a sequence diagram could be structured in PlantUML syntax. This example assumes that the customer interacts with a web-based GUI, which then communicates with a server that queries a database to check the availability of books. The result is then sent back through the server to the user interface, displaying the information to the customer.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Customer -> Web: Search for book by title/author
Web -> Server: Request book availability
activate Server
Server -> DB: Query book availability
activate DB
DB --> Server: Book availability data
deactivate DB
Server --> Web: Book availability result
deactivate Server
Web --> Customer: Display book availability
@enduml
```

To use this PlantUML script:

1. You'll need to have PlantUML installed or access to an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy and paste the provided script into your PlantUML environment.
3. Generate the sequence diagram, which will visually represent the steps involved in checking the availability of books from the customer's perspective.

This diagram focuses on the sequence of actions starting from the customer's initial request up to receiving the information. Modifications or extensions might be necessary to reflect additional complexities or features of the CLMS, such as handling reservations or integrating with external recommendation services.

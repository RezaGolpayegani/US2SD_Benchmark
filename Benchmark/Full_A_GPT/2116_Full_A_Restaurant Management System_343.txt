To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As an employee, I want to know the customer orders and best selling products so that I can suggest these products to them when they are indecisive to choose a product", we'll outline the interaction between the employee, the system's interface, and the backend services including the order management system and the sales analytics system. This diagram illustrates how an employee would retrieve information about current customer orders and data on best selling products.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant "Employee Interface" as EI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Sales Analytics System" as SAS
database "Database" as DB

E -> EI : Request current orders and best sellers
activate EI

EI -> OMS : Get current orders
activate OMS
OMS -> DB : Query current orders
activate DB
DB -> OMS : Return orders
deactivate DB
OMS -> EI : Display current orders
deactivate OMS

EI -> SAS : Get best selling products
activate SAS
SAS -> DB : Query best sellers
activate DB
DB -> SAS : Return best sellers list
deactivate DB
SAS -> EI : Display best sellers
deactivate SAS

EI -> E : Show current orders and best sellers
deactivate EI

E -> E : Suggest best sellers to customer

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Employee (E)** initiates the process by requesting information on current orders and best selling products from the **Employee Interface (EI)**.
2. **EI** then makes a request to the **Order Management System (OMS)** to retrieve the current orders.
3. **OMS** queries the **Database (DB)** for current order data and returns this information back to **EI**.
4. Almost simultaneously, **EI** requests data on the best selling products from the **Sales Analytics System (SAS)**.
5. **SAS** queries the **DB** for the best-selling products data and returns this information back to **EI**.
6. **EI** compiles and displays both sets of information—current orders and best selling products—to the **Employee**.
7. Finally, the **Employee** uses this information to suggest best selling items to customers who are indecisive.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in fulfilling the employee's wish to suggest the best selling products to customers based on real-time orders and sales analytics.

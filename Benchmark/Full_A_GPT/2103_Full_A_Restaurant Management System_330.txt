Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story "As an employee, I want to change the amount of resources so that my manager always tracks the right amount of resources" involves several steps and actors, including the employee, frontend interface, backend server, and the database. Hereâ€™s a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as emp
participant "Frontend UI" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

emp -> ui : Select resource to update
ui -> server : Request resource update page
server -> db : Fetch current resource details
db -> server : Return current details
server -> ui : Display resource details
emp -> ui : Input new resource amount
ui -> server : Submit update request(new amount)
server -> db : Update resource amount in database
db -> server : Confirm update success
server -> ui : Display update confirmation
ui -> emp : Show success message

Explanation:
1. **Employee Interaction**: The employee initiates the process by selecting a resource they intend to update through the frontend user interface (UI).
2. **Request Resource Update Page**: The UI then requests this page or modal from the backend server, which in turn fetches the current details of the resource from the database.
3. **Display Resource Details**: The current resource details are returned to the backend server from the database, and then they are sent to the frontend UI to be displayed to the employee.
4. **Input New Resource Amount**: The employee inputs the new amount or quantity for the resource through the UI.
5. **Submit Update Request**: The new amount is submitted to the backend server.
6. **Update Resource Amount in Database**: The backend server processes the update request and changes the resource amount in the database accordingly.
7. **Confirm Update Success**: Once the database has successfully updated the resource amount, it sends a confirmation back to the backend server.
8. **Display Update Confirmation**: The backend server instructs the frontend UI to display a confirmation message that the resource amount has been successfully updated.
9. **Show Success Message**: Finally, the employee is shown a success message, ensuring them that the resource update has been successfully recorded.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and can be expanded with more details specific to the project's implementation needs, including error handling, authentication, and authorization steps.

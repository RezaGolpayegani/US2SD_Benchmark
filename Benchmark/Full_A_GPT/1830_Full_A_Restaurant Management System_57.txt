To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a cook, I want to view reports on customer orders so that I can change my menu according to that," using PlantUML, you'll have to define the interaction between various system components and actors involved in generating and viewing the order reports that will influence menu adjustments. 

Given your requirements, we'll include components like the Cook interface, Report Generator, Menu Management System, and possibly a Database where order data is stored. Here's how you might outline this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Cook
participant "Cook Interface" as CI
participant "Report Generator" as RG
database "Database" as DB
participant "Menu Management System" as MMS

Cook -> CI: Request order reports
CI -> RG: Generate order report
RG -> DB: Query order data
DB -> RG: Return order data
RG -> CI: Display order reports
CI -> Cook: Show order reports

Cook -> CI: Review report data
Cook -> CI: Decide menu changes
CI -> MMS: Initiate menu update process
MMS -> DB: Update menu data
DB -> MMS: Confirm menu update
MMS -> CI: Confirm update to Cook
CI -> Cook: Display menu update confirmation

This sequence diagram starts with the Cook requesting order reports through the Cook Interface. The Report Generator then queries the database for the necessary order data and generates a report which is displayed back to the Cook. After reviewing the report data, the Cook decides on menu changes and initiates a menu update process through the Menu Management System. The Menu Management System updates the menu data in the database and confirms the update to the Cook.

Please adjust the diagram as needed based on specific functionalities of your system or additional steps involved in your process. This diagram is a simplified version, focusing on the main steps related to the user story provided.

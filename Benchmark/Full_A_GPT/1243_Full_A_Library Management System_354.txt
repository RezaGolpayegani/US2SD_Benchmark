Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story outlined requires outlining the interaction between various system components when a staff member searches for a book by name. Below is a representation in PlantUML format, visualizing how this process might work within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Staff as staff
participant WebInterface as web
participant SearchController as controller
participant BookDatabase as database

staff -> web : inputs book name in search
activate web

web -> controller : initiateSearch(bookName)
activate controller

controller -> database : queryBookByName(bookName)
activate database

alt book found
    database --> controller : return book details
    controller --> web : display book details
else book not found
    database --> controller : return not found message
    controller --> web : display not found message
end

web --> staff : show search results
deactivate database
deactivate controller
deactivate web

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Initiating Search**: The process begins with a staff member entering a book name into the search field within the web interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).
   
2. **Search Request**: The web interface sends the search request, including the book name, to the `SearchController`.

3. **Query Database**: The `SearchController` forwards the query to the `BookDatabase`, where the system looks for the book by its name.

4. **Response Handling**: Depending on whether the book is found or not, the `BookDatabase` returns the book details or a not found message to the `SearchController`.

5. **Display Results**: The `SearchController` then sends the information back to the web interface, which finally presents the search results to the staff member.

Please note, this diagram assumes a simplified interaction flow and does not account for potential complexities such as authentication, error handling, or the intricacies of communication between the database and controller. In a real-world scenario, additional details and steps might be needed to fully capture the nuances of such a system.

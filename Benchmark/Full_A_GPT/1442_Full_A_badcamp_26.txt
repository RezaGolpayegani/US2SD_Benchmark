Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting the interactions between the user and the system components to fulfill the request to see a list of sessions associated with sponsor attendees. Below is a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Anonymous User" as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Sessions Module" as sessions
participant "Sponsors Module" as sponsors
database "Sessions Database" as db

user -> web : Request Sessions Associated\nwith Sponsor Attendees
web -> sessions : Fetch Sponsor Sessions
activate sessions

sessions -> sponsors: Get Sponsor IDs
activate sponsors
sponsors -> db : Query Sponsor Details
db --> sponsors : Return Sponsor Details
deactivate sponsors

sessions -> db : Query Sessions by Sponsor IDs
db --> sessions : Return Sessions List
deactivate sessions

sessions -> web : Display Sessions List
web --> user : Show Sponsor Sessions
@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates the following steps in the process:

1. The **Anonymous User** requests a list of sessions associated with sponsor attendees via the **Web Interface**.
2. The **Web Interface** forwards this request to the **Sessions Module** to fetch the relevant sessions.
3. The **Sessions Module** queries the **Sponsors Module** to get the IDs or details of the sponsors associated with the attendees.
4. The **Sponsors Module** then queries the **Sessions Database** to retrieve sponsor details.
5. With the sponsor details, the **Sessions Module** now queries the **Sessions Database** again, this time to get a list of sessions by the sponsor IDs.
6. The database returns the list of sessions associated with the sponsors to the **Sessions Module**.
7. The **Sessions Module** sends this information back to the **Web Interface**.
8. Finally, the **Web Interface** displays the list of sponsor-associated sessions to the **Anonymous User**.

This PlantUML code describes the sequence of interactions that fulfill the anonymous user's request to view sessions connected to sponsor attendees, highlighting the server-side processing and data retrieval mechanisms involved.

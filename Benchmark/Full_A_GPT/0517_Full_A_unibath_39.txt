Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided involves several actors and components interacting with each other. Given the complexity and scope of your project, the sequence diagram below outlines the basic steps a Bath Data Archive administrator might take to import data from an external data center wholesale into the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. For simplicity, some very detailed interactions might be abstracted, but this will give a good overview.

In PlantUML syntax, here's how such a sequence diagram could look:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "API Gateway" as api
participant "Data Import Service" as import
database "External Data Center" as externalDC
database "Bath Data Archive" as BDA

admin -> web : Initiates data import process
web -> api : Request to import data
api -> import : Calls import service
import -> externalDC : Fetch data wholesale
externalDC -> import : Return requested data
import -> BDA : Store data in Bath Data Archive
BDA -> import : Confirm data storage
import -> api : Confirm import success
api -> web : Display success message
web -> admin : Show confirmation of data import

@enduml
```

This UML sequence diagram starts with the Bath Data Archive administrator initiating the import process via a web interface. The process flows through an API Gateway to a specialized Data Import Service, which then interacts with the External Data Center to fetch the required data. Once the data is retrieved, it's stored in the Bath Data Archive, with confirmation of storage sent back up the chain, eventually notifying the administrator of successful import.

Remember, based on the specifics of the architecture of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform and the capabilities of the external data center, there might be authentication and authorization steps, error handling, and data validation processes that you would also need to consider and diagram for a fully implementable solution.

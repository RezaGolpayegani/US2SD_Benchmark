Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a library visitor, I want to sort the books in alphabetical order only searching for the genre that I am interested in" using PlantUML requires us to outline the interactions between different entities such as the user (Library Visitor), the UI (User Interface), the Controller, and the Database.

Here's a basic PlantUML code to visualize this process. The code includes interactions from the moment the user starts searching for books by genre and sorts them in alphabetical order:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryVisitor as Visitor
participant "UI/Web Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Controller" as Controller
participant "Database" as DB

Visitor -> UI : Enter/search by genre
UI -> Controller : Request books by genre
Controller -> DB : Query books by specific genre
DB -> Controller : Return list of books in genre
Controller -> UI : Display unsorted books in genre
Visitor -> UI : Select sort alphabetically
UI -> Controller : Request sorting alphabetically
Controller -> DB : Fetch books details
DB -> Controller : Return book details
Controller -> Controller : Sort books alphabetically
Controller -> UI : Display books sorted
UI -> Visitor : Show alphabetically sorted books

```

### Explained Steps:

1. **Library Visitor Initiates Search:** The library visitor enters their desired genre into the user interface to start the search.

2. **UI to Backend Controller:** The UI sends the visitor's request to the backend controller to find books of the specified genre.

3. **Controller Queries Database:** The backend controller sends a query to the database to retrieve a list of books that match the genre.

4. **Database Returns Results:** The database returns a list of books within the specified genre to the controller.

5. **Display Unsorted Books:** The controller then sends these results back to the UI, which displays the unsorted books to the visitor.

6. **Visitor Requests Sorting:** The visitor selects the option to sort the results alphabetically.

7. **UI Requests Sorting:** The UI sends a request back to the controller to sort the books alphabetically.

8. **Controller Sorts Books:** The controller performs the sorting operation either by itself or queries the database again for the book details, sorts them alphabetically in the controller, and then prepares the sorted list.

9. **Sorted Display to Visitor:** Finally, the sorted list is sent from the controller to the UI, which displays the alphabetically sorted books to the visitor.

This sequence diagram focuses on the interactions specific to the user story's requirements. Depending on the system's complexity, additional details or steps might be added, such as error handling, authentication checks, or more detailed sorting options.

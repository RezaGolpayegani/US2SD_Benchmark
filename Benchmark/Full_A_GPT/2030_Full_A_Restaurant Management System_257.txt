Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a restaurant manager, I want to see monthly reports" involves illustrating the flow of interactions between the restaurant manager, the Restaurant Management and Operations System, and possibly other components involved in generating the monthly reports. This scenario assumes that the manager interacts with a web-based interface to request and view the reports, which are generated by aggregating data from various modules of the system like sales, inventory, and employee performance.

Below is a basic example of what the PlantUML code for such a sequence diagram could look like. This example focuses on illustrating the core interactions and may need adjustments to match specific implementation details of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Report Module" as reports
participant Database as db

manager -> web : Request monthly reports
activate web
web -> reports : Fetch report data
activate reports
reports -> db : Query sales data
activate db
db --> reports : Return sales data
deactivate db
reports -> db : Query inventory data
activate db
db --> reports : Return inventory data
deactivate db
reports -> db : Query employee performance
activate db
db --> reports : Return employee data
deactivate db
reports --> web : Compile report
deactivate reports
web --> manager : Display reports
deactivate web
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Restaurant Manager (user) requesting monthly reports via the Web Interface. The request is processed by a Report Module, which then aggregates the necessary data from the Database. This data might include sales figures, inventory levels, and employee performance metrics, which are crucial components of monthly reports. Once compiled, the report is sent back to the Web; the Web Interface then displays these compiled reports to the manager.

Please note, this diagram is a high-level overview. The actual implementation can include more detailed steps such as authentication processes, more specific data queries (like fetching data based on date ranges), and error handling mechanisms. Additionally, depending on specific requirements, there could be interactions with other modules or systems (for instance, a third-party analytics service) which are not depicted in this basic diagram.

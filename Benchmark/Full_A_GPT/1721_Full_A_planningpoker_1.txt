Given the requirements of your user story, I'll provide a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process a moderator would follow to create a new game, with an optional description, before inviting estimators using the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT).

Please note, since the sequence diagram is textual, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor (available in many development environments or online editors) to visualize the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Moderator
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Game Management System" as GMS
database "Database" as DB

Moderator -> UI : Access Create Game Page
activate UI

UI -> GMS : Render Create Game Form
activate GMS

GMS -> UI : Display Form
activate UI
deactivate GMS

Moderator -> UI : Enter Game Name and Description
activate UI

UI -> GMS : Submit Game Creation Request (Name, Description)
activate GMS

GMS -> DB : Store Game Information
activate DB
DB --> GMS : Confirmation
deactivate DB
GMS -> UI : Game Created Successfully
deactivate GMS

UI --> Moderator : Display Success Message & Shareable URL
deactivate UI
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram describes the following steps for the user story:

1. The Moderator accesses the game creation page through the web interface.
2. The Web Interface requests the game management system to render the form for creating a new game.
3. The Game Management System sends the form to the Web Interface, which is then displayed to the Moderator.
4. The Moderator inputs the required game name and an optional description and submits this information via the Web Interface.
5. The Web Interface forwards this information to the Game Management System to process the game creation request.
6. The Game Management System subsequently stores this information in the database.
7. Once the information is successfully stored, the Game Management System notifies the Web Interface of the successful game creation.
8. The Web Interface displays a success message to the Moderator, along with a shareable URL that can be used to invite estimators to the game.

For actual implementation, this diagram can be refined further based on specific technologies used and additional functionalities or constraints of the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool.

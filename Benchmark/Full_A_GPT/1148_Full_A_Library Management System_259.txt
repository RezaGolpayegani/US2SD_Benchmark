Creating a sequence diagram for the process of a library member searching for books by author involves outlining the interactions between the system's components to accomplish this task. Here is a PlantUML code representation of such a sequence diagram for your described user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Search Controller" as Controller
database "Library Database" as DB

Member -> UI : Enters search query (Author name)
UI -> Controller : Request to search books by author
activate Controller

Controller -> DB : Query books by author name
activate DB
DB --> Controller : Return list of books
deactivate DB

Controller --> UI : Display book results
UI --> Member : Shows list of books by the queried author

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows a simple yet common flow for a book search by author functionality within a library management system:

1. **Member (User Interaction):** The library member initiates the search by entering an author's name into the system's user interface (UI). This action represents the member's intent to find books when they do not remember specific titles but know the author's name.

2. **UI Interface (System Interface):** The UI receives the search query from the member. This is the interface where members interact with the library management system, be it a web application, mobile app, or a kiosk within the library.

3. **Search Controller (Backend Logic):** Once the UI passes the member's query to the backend system, the search controller takes over. This component is responsible for handling the search logic, including validating the search parameters and preparing the request for data retrieval from the database.

4. **Library Database (Data Management):** The controller sends a query to the library's database, looking for books that match the author's name provided by the member. The database is a crucial component where all the data about books, authors, and borrowing history are stored.

5. **Data Flow and Results:** The database processes the query and returns the list of books by the specified author to the search controller, which then sends this data back to the UI. Finally, the UI displays the search results to the member.

This sequence diagram abstracts many underlying processes and assumes the existence of a comprehensive set of functionalities within the library management system to handle user requests, database queries, and information display. Adjustments may be required based on the specific technologies or frameworks used in the implementation of the Comprehensive Library Is Management System (CLMS).

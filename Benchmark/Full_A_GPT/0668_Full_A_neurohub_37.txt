Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in the context of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project requires outlining the interactions between the lab administrator and the system components involved in creating page templates with custom metadata fields. Below is a PlantUML code that represents these interactions.

Please note, to use this PlantUML code, you will need a PlantUML environment setup like an online editor (e.g., PlantText or PlantUML QEditor) or a local development environment configured to interpret and render PlantUML diagrams.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Lab Administrator" as admin
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Template Engine" as engine
participant "Metadata Manager" as metadata
participant "Database" as db

admin -> web: Access page template creator
web -> engine: Initiate template creation
engine -> web: Display template editor
admin -> web: Input template design
admin -> web: Specify bespoke metadata fields
web -> metadata: Request metadata field creation
metadata -> db: Store new metadata definitions
db -> metadata: Confirm metadata stored
metadata -> web: Confirm custom fields creation
web -> engine: Create template with custom fields
engine -> db: Save template
db -> engine: Confirm template saved
engine -> web: Display success message
web -> admin: Notify template creation success

**Explanation:**

1. **Lab Administrator to Web Interface:** The lab administrator starts the process by accessing the page template creation feature in the Neurohub web interface.
2. **Web Interface to Template Engine:** The web interface communicates with the backend template engine to initiate the creation process.
3. **Template Engine to Web Interface (Display):** The template engine provides the template editor back to the web interface for the administrator to use.
4. **Lab Administrator Inputs:** The lab administrator inputs the design of the page template and specifies the bespoke metadata fields through the web interface.
5. **Web Interface to Metadata Manager (Field Creation):** The request for creating new metadata fields is sent from the web interface to the metadata manager.
6. **Metadata Manager to Database:** The metadata manager handles the request by storing the new metadata definitions in the database.
7. **Database to Metadata Manager (Confirmation):** The database confirms that the metadata definitions have been stored.
8. **Metadata Manager to Web Interface:** The metadata manager confirms back to the web interface that the custom fields have been created.
9. **Web Interface to Template Engine (Create Template):** With the metadata fields confirmed, the web interface sends a request to create the template with those fields to the template engine.
10. **Template Engine to Database (Save Template):** The newly created template, including the custom metadata fields, is saved in the database by the template engine.
11. **Database to Template Engine (Confirm Save):** The database confirms that the template has been successfully saved.
12. **Template Engine to Web Interface (Success Message):** The template engine sends a success message back to the web interface.
13. **Web Interface to Lab Administrator:** Lastly, the web interface notifies the lab administrator that the template creation process has been successfully completed.

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in the creation of page templates with bespoke metadata fields from the perspective of a lab administrator using the Neurohub platform.

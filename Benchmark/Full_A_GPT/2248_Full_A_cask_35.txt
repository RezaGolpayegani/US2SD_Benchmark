Creating a PlantUML sequence diagram for the given user story involves detailing the interactions between different entities such as the dataset developer, the version control system, the dataset instance, and potentially other services that are part of the process. Below is an illustrative example of how these interactions might be structured in PlantUML syntax, focusing on implementing an upgrade step during a dataset instance version update.

Please note, the following UML diagram is a generic representation and can be adapted or expanded based on the specific technical architecture and process flow your project employs.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Dataset Developer" as developer
participant "Version Control System" as VCS
participant "Dataset Instance" as Dataset
database "Migration Scripts" as Scripts

== Upgrade Process ==
developer -> VCS: Request dataset type upgrade
VCS -> Dataset: Check current version
alt If Dataset version is outdated
  VCS -> Scripts: Fetch upgrade scripts for new version
  Scripts --> VCS: Return scripts
  VCS -> Dataset: Apply upgrade scripts
  Dataset -> Dataset: Upgrade to new version
  Dataset --> VCS: Upgrade success confirmation
  VCS --> developer: Upgrade process completed successfully
else If Dataset is already at latest version
  VCS --> developer: Dataset instance already at latest version
end

### Key Points in the Sequence Diagram:
- **Dataset Developer Initiates Upgrade:** The dataset developer requests an upgrade through the version control system (VCS), which acts as the central coordinator for managing dataset versions.
- **Version Check:** The version control system checks the current version of the dataset instance to determine if an upgrade is necessary.
- **Fetch and Apply Upgrade Scripts:** If the dataset instance is on an older version, the VCS fetches the appropriate upgrade scripts from a repository or database of migration scripts. These scripts are then applied to the dataset instance to perform the upgrade.
- **Outcome:** After applying the necessary upgrade scripts, the dataset instance is upgraded to the new version. The version control system confirms the successful upgrade to the dataset developer.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview and can be detailed further based on the project's specific requirements, such as handling failures during the upgrade process, rollback mechanisms, notifications to other stakeholders, or integration with other systems for seamless dataset management across different environments.

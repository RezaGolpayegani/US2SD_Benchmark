To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story mentioned, we will outline the interactions between various system components and actors needed to fulfill the requirement that backend changes support loading enumeration (enum) value lists from the database. Since we're focusing on backend changes, the primary actors are the system components involved in fetching and presenting the enum values.

This example will involve a simplified interaction between a `User`, the `Web Application`, the `Application Server`, and the `Database`. The sequence will illustrate the process from the user initiating a request to load a page that requires enum values, through the system fetching those values from the database, to rendering them back to the user.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web Application" as WebApp
participant "Application Server" as AppServer
participant "Database" as DB

== User Requests Enum Value List Page ==
User -> WebApp : Request Page
activate WebApp

WebApp -> AppServer : Fetch Enum Values\n(Request)
activate AppServer

AppServer -> DB : SELECT Enum Values\n(Query)
activate DB

DB --> AppServer : Return Enum Values\n(Result Set)
deactivate DB

AppServer --> WebApp : Enum Values\n(Response)
deactivate AppServer

WebApp --> User : Display Page with\nEnum Values
deactivate WebApp

```

### Explanation:

1. **User Requests Enum Value List Page**: This is where the user initiates the process by requesting a page that requires enum values (e.g., a dropdown list of categories in a form).

2. **Web Application**: Receives the request and understands it needs enum values from the backend to complete the page rendering.

3. **Application Server**: Acts upon the request from the web application, initiating a query to the database to fetch the required enum value lists.

4. **Database**: Executes the query and returns the requested enum values to the application server.

5. **Application Server to Web Application**: The application server processes the database response and sends the enum values back to the web application.

6. **Web Application to User**: Finally, the web application integrates the enum values into the requested page and presents it to the user.

This PlantUML sequence diagram showcases a basic interaction flow for loading enum value lists from the database based on a backend change requirement. Depending on the complexity of your specific system architecture, more components or steps might be involved, such as caching services, API gateways, or additional layers of logic in both the application server and the database interactions.

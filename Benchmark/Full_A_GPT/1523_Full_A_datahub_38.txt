To fulfill your request for generating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, focusing on the user story where a web developer wants to install multiple versions of the same data package separately for developing and deploying projects independently, the following UML sequence diagram script is provided:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "CLI Tool" as CLI
database "Data Registry\nPlatform" as Registry
database "Local Project\nRepository" as LocalRepo

Developer -> CLI: request datapackage\n(version specific)
CLI -> Registry: search for datapackage\n(particular version)
Registry --> CLI: return datapackage metadata\n(URL, version, dependencies)
CLI -> Developer: show datapackage metadata\n(confirmation)
Developer -> CLI: confirm download
CLI -> Registry: request datapackage download
Registry --> CLI: provide datapackage file
CLI -> LocalRepo: install datapackage\n(in project-specific version)
LocalRepo --> CLI: confirm installation
CLI --> Developer: display installation\nsuccess message
@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Developer requests a datapackage**: The web developer uses the Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to request a specific version of a datapackage. This includes specifying the datapackage name and the version they wish to install.
   
2. **CLI searches for the datapackage**: The CLI tool communicates with the Data Registry and Publishing Platform to search for the requested datapackage and its specific version.

3. **Registry returns datapackage metadata**: Upon finding the datapackage, the registry sends back to the CLI tool all relevant metadata, including the URL for the datapackage, its version, and any dependencies it might have.

4. **CLI shows datapackage metadata to the Developer**: Before proceeding with the download, the CLI tool presents the retrieved metadata to the developer for confirmation. This step ensures that the developer is aware of the exact package version and its characteristics.

5. **Developer confirms download**: If the metadata aligns with the developer's expectations, they confirm the download action.

6. **CLI requests datapackage download**: With the developer's confirmation, the CLI now requests the actual download of the datapackage from the Data Registry and Publishing Platform.

7. **Registry provides the datapackage file**: The registry responds by providing the datapackage file to the CLI tool.

8. **CLI installs the datapackage in the Local Project Repository**: The CLI tool then proceeds to install the downloaded datapackage into the developer's local project repository, ensuring it is stored under a directory or path that respects the requested version.

9. **Installation confirmation**: Upon successful installation, the Local Project Repository confirms back to the CLI tool, which in turn notifies the developer with a success message indicating that the datapackage (of the specific version requested) is now installed and ready for use within their project.

This sequence diagram outlines the process steps from requesting a specific version of a datapackage by the developer, through the search, metadata review, download, and installation phases, finally confirming the successful setup in the developer's local environment.

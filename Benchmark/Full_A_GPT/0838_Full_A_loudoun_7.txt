### Explanation:

1. **Login to User Account**: The sequence begins with the Applicant logging into their User Account on the Customer Portal, which is a critical step for user authentication and personalized service access.

2. **Display Dashboard (Outstanding Fees)**: After login, the Customer Portal displays the user's Dashboard, including any outstanding fees associated with the services they have applied for or received.

3. **Select Fee to Pay**: The Applicant selects the specific fee they wish to pay via the Customer Portal.

4. **Initiate Payment Process**: The Customer Portal then initiates the payment process by communicating with the Payment System.

5. **Display Payment Form**: The Payment System presents the Applicant with a payment form to enter their payment details.

6. **Enter Payment Details (Card Info, Amount)**: The Applicant enters their payment details into the form provided by the Payment System.

7. **Validate Payment Information**: The Payment System validates the payment information provided by the Applicant.

8. **Payment Successful**: If the payment is successful, the Payment System displays a success message to the Applicant and notifies the Customer Portal of the successful payment.

9. **Update Fee Status**: The Customer Portal updates the fee status in the County Database to reflect the payment.

10. **Update User Dashboard (Fee Paid)**: The Customer Portal updates the Applicant's Dashboard, showing that the fee has been paid.

11. **Payment Failed**: If the payment fails, the Payment System displays a failure message and prompts the Applicant to retry the payment.

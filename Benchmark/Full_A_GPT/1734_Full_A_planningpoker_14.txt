To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a moderator, I want to import stories from a spreadsheet, so that I don't have to copy and paste each individual story." in PlantUML format, you would describe the flow from the moderator initiating the import process to the stories being imported into the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT). Below is a PlantUML diagram representation of this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant Moderator
participant "Import Interface" as ImportUI
participant "File System" as FileSystem
participant "Spreadsheet Parser" as Parser
participant "AEPT Database" as Database

Moderator -> ImportUI : Select "Import Stories"
ImportUI -> FileSystem : Browse for file
FileSystem -> Moderator : Display file selection dialog
Moderator -> FileSystem : Select spreadsheet file (.xlsx or .csv)
FileSystem -> ImportUI : Return file path
ImportUI -> Parser : Parse spreadsheet file
Parser -> Parser : Validate and extract stories
alt Parsing Success
    Parser -> Database : Save extracted stories
    Database -> Parser : Confirmation of saved stories
    Parser -> ImportUI : Show success message
    ImportUI -> Moderator : Display success and imported stories summary
else Parsing or Saving Error
    Parser -> ImportUI : Show error message
    ImportUI -> Moderator : Display error and suggestions
end

```

This sequence diagram starts with the moderator selecting the "Import Stories" option within the application. Then, it moves through the process of selecting a spreadsheet file using the file system dialog. Once a file is selected, it's passed to a spreadsheet parser that validates and extracts the story details from the file. If the parsing and validation are successful, the stories are saved to the AEPT database, and a success message is displayed to the moderator, along with a summary of the imported stories. In case of any errors during the parsing or saving process, an error message is shown, providing suggestions or actions to the moderator.

Please note that for a functioning implementation, you would need to adapt this sequence diagram based on specific technology choices, error handling policies, and user interface designs.

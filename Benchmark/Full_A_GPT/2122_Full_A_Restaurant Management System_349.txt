Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to read the menu" involves illustrating the interactions between different objects (employee, UI, server, and database) in the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Below is a sample PlantUML code that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Server" as S
participant "Database" as DB

E -> UI : Request menu view
activate E
activate UI

UI -> S : Fetch menu request
activate S

S -> DB : Get latest menu data
activate DB
DB --> S : Return menu data
deactivate DB

S --> UI : Menu data
deactivate S

UI --> E : Display menu
deactivate UI
deactivate E

@enduml
```
How to use this PlantUML code:

1. **Installation (If required)**: Ensure you have PlantUML installed on your local machine, or use an online PlantUML editor. Online editors often provide a straightforward interface to paste and render UML diagrams without needing an environment setup.

2. **Rendering the Diagram**: Copy the above PlantUML code and paste it into your PlantUML application or an online PlantUML editor. Once the code is processed, it will display the sequence diagram for the user story.

3. **Understanding the Diagram**: This sequence diagram starts with the employee requesting to view the menu through the UI Interface (this could be a web page or an application interface). The request is then forwarded to the server, which queries the Database for the latest menu data. The Database returns the menu data to the Server, which then sends it back to the UI Interface. Finally, the UI Interface displays the menu to the employee.

This diagram is a simplified example meant to illustrate the core interactions for the described user story. Depending on the system's complexity and additional requirements, further details and components could be added, such as error handling, security checks, and more specific interactions within the server or between microservices (if applicable).

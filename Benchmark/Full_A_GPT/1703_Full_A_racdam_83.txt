Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an archivist, I want to search images by photographer" involves outlining the interactions between the system components and the user. Below is a basic outline in PlantUML format to illustrate these interactions for the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project. 

This example assumes a simplified process where the archivist enters a search query (the photographer's name), which is processed by the system to return relevant image results.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "Search Interface" as searchInterface
participant "Search Controller" as searchController
participant "Database" as database

archivist -> search interface: Enter search query ('photographer name')
searchInterface -> searchController: Search request ('photographer name')
searchController -> database: Query images by photographer ('photographer name')
database -> searchController: Return image results
searchController -> searchInterface: Display image results
searchInterface -> archivist: Show image results
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Archivist (Actor):** The archivist initiates the process by inputting the photographer's name into the search interface. This actor represents the user carrying out the action.

2. **Search Interface (Participant):** This component is the front-end interface where the archivist enters their search query. It captures the query and forwards it to the Search Controller.

3. **Search Controller (Participant):** Acts as a mediator between the search interface and the database. It translates the search request into a query that the database can understand.

4. **Database (Participant):** The repository where all digital images and their metadata are stored. Upon receiving a query from the Search Controller, it searches for images tagged with or associated with the specified photographer's name and returns the results.

5. **Interactions:** The sequence starts with the archivist entering a search query. The Search Interface receives this input and passes it to the Search Controller, which then queries the Database. The Database returns the search results to the Search Controller, which then sends these results back to be displayed by the Search Interface to the archivist.

This is a high-level overview of the search functionality within the context of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project. Depending on the specifics of your system architecture, database schema, and requirements, more details can be added to this sequence diagram, including error handling, authentication steps (if the search is restricted), and interactions with other system components such as logging services or an indexing engine for performance optimization.

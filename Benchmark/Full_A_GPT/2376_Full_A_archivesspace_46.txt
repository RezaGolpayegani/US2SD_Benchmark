Below is a detailed Sequence Diagram written in PlantUML format, capturing the process for a Basic Data Entry user to create and update basic archival description information within the Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Entry User" as user
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Module" as Auth
participant "Validation Service" as Validator
participant "Archival Description Controller" as ADC
database "Archival Database" as DB

== Authentication ==
user -> UI : Access System
UI -> Auth : Authenticate User
Auth -> UI : Authentication Success

== Create Archival Description ==
user -> UI : Select Create New Record
UI -> ADC : Initiate New Archival Description
ADC -> Validator : Validate User Permissions
Validator -> ADC : Permission Granted

ADC -> DB : Create New Record
DB -> ADC : Record Creation Success
ADC -> UI : Display Success Message
UI -> user : Show Success & New Record Details

== Update Archival Description ==
user -> UI : Select and Edit Record
UI -> ADC : Request to Update Record
ADC -> Validator : Validate Edit Permissions
Validator -> ADC : Edit Permission Granted

ADC -> Validator : Validate Data
Validator -> ADC : Data Validation Success
ADC -> DB : Update Record
DB -> ADC : Record Update Success
ADC -> UI : Display Success Message
UI -> user : Show Updated Record

This sequence diagram starts with the user accessing the system and being authenticated. Once authenticated, the user can either create a new archival description or select an existing one to update. Each action (create or update) involves permission and data validation steps to ensure only authorized and accurate data modifications are made.

For creating a new archival description, the process includes the system creating a new record in the archival database and confirming the creation back to the user. For updating an existing description, the diagram outlines the steps for the system to validate changes, update the record in the database, and confirm the update to the user.

Please adjust the diagram as necessary to fit the specific features and workflows of your Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement project.

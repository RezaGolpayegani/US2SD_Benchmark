Given the complexity and depth of the functionality described in your user story, here's a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram showing the series of interactions between different components of the system when a patron wants to discover related reports or datasets. This example assumes the presence of a web interface, an authentication component, a search/indexing engine, and a 'Related Items' feature that leverages metadata or content analysis to find and recommend related materials.

Please note, PlantUML syntax can be expanded or modified to reflect more specific implementation details or to adapt to particular technologies used in the system's architecture.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant PatronBrowser as Browser
participant AuthSystem as Auth
participant RepositoryServer as Server
participant SearchEngine as Search
participant Database as DB

Browser -> Server: Request report/dataset details
Server -> Auth: Validate request
Auth -> Server: Validation response
note right of Server: Authentication may involve checking\nsession tokens or API keys
Server -> DB: Retrieve report/dataset metadata
DB -> Server: Return metadata
Server -> Browser: Display report/dataset details
note over Browser: Details page includes "Related Items" section

Browser -> Server: Request related reports/datasets
Server -> Search: Query for related items based on metadata
note right of Search: Algorithms to find related items can\nuse keywords, authors, subjects, etc.
Search -> DB: Fetch related items
DB -> Search: Return related items metadata
Search -> Server: Related items metadata
Server -> Browser: Display related reports/datasets

note over Browser: Patron can click on related item\nto view its details

This sequence diagram outlines the main interactions:

1. **Patron's Request:** The patron uses their browser to request the details of a specific report or dataset hosted in the repository.
2. **Authentication Check:** The repository server checks with the authentication system to ensure the request is valid.
3. **Fetching Details:** The requested item's metadata is retrieved from the database and shown to the patron, including a section for related items.
4. **Requesting Related Items:** When the patron expresses interest in related reports or datasets (possibly via a UI action like clicking a "See also" link), the server initiates a query to find related items.
5. **Related Items Identification:** The search engine uses the item's metadata to find related reports or datasets, retrieving these related items' metadata from the database.
6. **Displaying Results:** The metadata for related reports or datasets is returned to the browser, allowing the patron to explore related works.

This diagram is simplified for clarity and could be expanded to detail error handling, more complex authorization logic, or the algorithms for identifying related items. Depending on the specific architecture of Cornell University's digital repository system, additional components or interactions might be required.

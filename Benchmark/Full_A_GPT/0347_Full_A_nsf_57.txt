To visualize the process described in the user story as a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, we consider the main activities and interactions between the user researcher and other components within the project framework. This specific user story requires coordination with various elements such as the project management team, the user interface (UI) for drafting plans, and the participant management system for recruiting participants. Hereâ€™s how you might script it in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserResearcher as researcher
participant "UI for Drafting Plan" as ui
participant "Project Management Team" as pmTeam
participant "Participant Management System" as participantSys

researcher -> ui: Access UI
ui -> researcher: Show Plan Template

researcher -> ui: Draft Research Plan
ui -> researcher: Confirm Draft Completion

researcher -> pmTeam: Submit Draft for Review
pmTeam -> researcher: Review Feedback

alt Approval
    pmTeam -> researcher: Approve Plan
    researcher -> participantSys: Initiate Participant Recruitment
    participantSys -> researcher: Confirmation & Recruitment Details
else Revision Needed
    pmTeam -> researcher: Request Revisions
    researcher -> ui: Revise Draft
    repeat
        researcher -> pmTeam: Resubmit Draft
        pmTeam -> researcher: Review Feedback
    until (Approval)
    researcher -> participantSys: Initiate Participant Recruitment
    participantSys -> researcher: Confirmation & Recruitment Details
end

This PlantUML diagram outlines the sequential steps a user researcher would take from the moment they set out to draft a research plan to the point where they can begin recruiting participants. It involves interactions with a User Interface designed for drafting plans, communication with the project management team for reviews and approvals, and finally, interaction with a participant management system to kick off the recruitment process.

Remember, to generate a visual representation from this script, you'll need to use PlantUML software or any compatible online service that supports PlantUML syntax.

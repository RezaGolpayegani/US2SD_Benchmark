Given the complexity and breadth of your project, a PlantUML sequence diagram focusing on the user story for developing a new social media wireframe involves various stakeholders including the designer eager to start implementing the design, the project team for direction and approvals, and potentially user research insights that inform the design requirements. 

For simplicity and focus, the following sequence diagram outline walks through the process from the designer's request to the initiation of design implementation based on the given user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Designer as D
participant "Project Team" as PT
participant "User Research" as UR
participant "Design Guidelines" as DG
participant "CMS" as CMS

== Request for Social Media Wireframe ==
D -> PT: Request design requirements
PT -> UR: Query user needs & preferences
UR --> PT: Provide user insights
PT -> DG: Request brand guidelines
DG --> D: Provide brand guidelines

== Design Wireframe Creation ==
D -> D: Analyze user insights & brand guidelines
D -> D: Create wireframe draft
D -> PT: Submit wireframe for feedback

== Feedback & Revision ==
PT -> D: Provide feedback
D -> D: Revise wireframe based on feedback
D -> PT: Resubmit revised wireframe
PT --> D: Approve wireframe

== Implement Design ==
D -> CMS: Start design implementation based on approved wireframe

This diagram is a simplified overview that walks through the main steps from the designer's initial request through to the implementation start. In reality, there can be additional loops of feedback and revision, and more stakeholders might be involved depending on the specific requirements and scope of the project. Additionally, given the agile approach highlighted in the project description, iterative design and continuous testing with user feedback would also be critical steps that could be expanded upon in a more detailed diagram or series of diagrams for each phase of the project.

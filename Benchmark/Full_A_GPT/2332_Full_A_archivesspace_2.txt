Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format involves depicting the interactions between different system actors and components for the process of resetting a user's password by an Application Administrator. Below is how the sequence diagram would look in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Application Administrator" as admin
participant "Admin Interface" as adminUI
participant "Authentication Server" as authServer
participant "Database" as db

admin -> adminUI : Selects 'Reset Password'
adminUI -> authServer : Request to reset user password
authServer -> db : Verify Admin Credentials
db -> authServer : Credentials Validated
authServer -> adminUI : Prompt for New Password
admin -> adminUI : Enters New Password
adminUI -> authServer : Submit New Password
authServer -> db : Update Password in Database
db -> authServer : Password Updated
authManager -> adminUI : Confirm Password Reset
adminUI -> admin : Display Password Reset Confirmation
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Application Administrator's action to reset a user's password and follows through the system components interactions—Admin Interface, Authentication Server, and Database—ending with the confirmation of the password reset to the Application Administrator.

To visualize this diagram, you need to have PlantUML installed or use any online PlantUML editor by copying the code above and pasting it into the editor. This description assumes basic functionality and flow without delving into specific security measures like encryption, which should be considered in a full implementation for ensuring password security during transmission and storage.

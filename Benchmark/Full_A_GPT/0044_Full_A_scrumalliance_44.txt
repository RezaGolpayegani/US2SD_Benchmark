Below is a PlantUML script that represents a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided. This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved when a site admin wants to approve each help wanted ad before it gets published on the site.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Recruiter
participant "Job Submission Form" as Form
participant "Website Backend" as Backend
participant "Job Approval Queue" as Queue
actor Admin
participant "Job Database" as Database

== Job Posting Submission ==
Recruiter -> Form : Submit Help Wanted Ad
Form -> Backend : Validate Submission
alt Submission is Invalid
    Backend -> Recruiter : Display Error Message
else Submission is Valid
    Backend -> Queue : Add Job to Approval Queue
    Recruiter -> Backend : Display "Pending Approval" Message
end

== Job Approval Process ==
Admin -> Queue : Review Job Listings
loop For Each Job in Queue
    alt Job is Approved
        Admin -> Backend : Approve Job Listing
        Backend -> Database : Save to Job Database
        Backend -> Admin : Display "Job Approved" Message
        Backend -> Recruiter : Send "Job Approved" Email Notification
    else Job is Rejected
        Admin -> Backend : Reject Job Listing
        Backend -> Admin : Display "Job Rejected" Message
        Backend -> Recruiter : Send "Job Rejected" Email Notification
    end
end

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

- **Recruiter Submission**: The sequence begins with the recruiter submitting the help wanted ad through a job submission form.
- **Validation**: The website backend validates the submission. If invalid (e.g., missing required fields), an error message is displayed to the recruiter. If valid, the ad is added to the job approval queue, and the recruiter sees a "Pending Approval" message.
- **Admin Review**: The admin reviews job listings in the approval queue.
- **Approval/Rejection Loop**: For each job in the queue, the admin has the option to approve or reject it.
    - **If Approved**: The backend saves the job to the database, the admin sees a "Job Approved" message, and the recruiter receives an email notification about the approval.
    - **If Rejected**: The admin marks the listing as rejected, sends a "Job Rejected" message to the recruiter via email, and the admin interface updates to reflect the rejected status.

This diagram assumes a basic flow and does not cover all possible exceptions or errors for simplicityâ€™s sake. Additional steps, such as logging activities or handling edge cases, can be added to provide more detailed insights into specific operations within the system.

Given the broad nature of the project description and the user story provided, the sequence diagram will focus on illustrating the process a user (e.g., a dataset developer or data scientist) follows to specify the schema of a dataset uniformly across all dataset types within the Advanced Dataset Management and Version Control System. Please note, for simplicity, the diagram does not include error handling or authentication steps.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant UserInterface as UI
participant ApiService as API
participant SchemaManagement as SchemaMan
participant VersionControl as VC
participant DatasetTypeRegistry as Registry

UI -> API : specifySchema(DatasetTypeId, SchemaConfig)
API -> SchemaMan : getDatasetType(DatasetTypeId)
SchemaMan -> Registry : fetchDatasetType(DatasetTypeId)
Registry --> SchemaMan : return DatasetTypeInterface
SchemaMan -> SchemaMan : validateSchema(SchemaConfig)
alt Schema is valid
    SchemaMan -> VC : checkVersionCompatibility(DatasetTypeId)
    VC --> SchemaMan : VersionCompatible
    SchemaMan --> API : SchemaValidated
    API --> UI : displaySuccess(Message)
else Schema is invalid
    SchemaMan --> API : SchemaValidationError(Error)
    API --> UI : displayError(Error)
end

### Explanation:

- **UserInterface (UI):** The starting point where the user interacts with the system to specify a schema for a dataset.

- **ApiService (API):** Acts as a middleman that processes the request from the UI and communicates with backend services to perform operations.

- **SchemaManagement (SchemaMan):** This component is responsible for handling dataset schema specifications. It retrieves dataset types, validates schema configurations, and checks version compatibility.

- **VersionControl (VC):** Manages version compatibility checks to ensure the specified schema is compatible with the dataset type's version.

- **DatasetTypeRegistry (Registry):** A registry or repository where dataset types and their interfaces are stored. It is queried to retrieve the specific dataset type interface based on the `DatasetTypeId`.

When a user wants to specify a schema for a dataset, they initiate a request through the UI. This request, containing the `DatasetTypeId` and schema configuration (`SchemaConfig`), is sent to the API.

The API forwards this request to the Schema Management component, which first retrieves the dataset type interface from the Dataset Type Getaway (Registry) using the provided `DatasetTypeId`. 

Upon retrieving the dataset type interface, the Schema Management component validates the provided schema configuration against the dataset type's requirements. If the schema is valid and compatible with the current dataset type version (as checked by the Version Control component), a success message is displayed to the user. If the schema is invalid or incompatible, an error message is displayed instead.

This sequence ensures a uniform approach to specifying dataset schemas across all dataset types in the system, aligning with the user story's goal.

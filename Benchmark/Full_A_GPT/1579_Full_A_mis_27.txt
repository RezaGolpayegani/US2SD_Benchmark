Below is an example PlantUML code to visually describe a sequence diagram for the user story: "As a Digital Records Archivist, I want to have a method to add and remove multiple people to deposit groups in specific collections, to set a date that the deposit window closes, and to have these permissions conferred on these depositors that should pick up on the collection's default permission."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "EDRMS Interface" as UI
participant "User & Group Management" as UGM
participant "Collection Management" as CM
participant "Permissions System" as PS

== Add People to Deposit Group ==
archivist -> UI: Accesses Deposit Group Management
UI -> UGM: Fetch existing deposit groups
UGM --> UI: Display deposit groups
UI --> archivist: Shows deposit groups
archivist -> UI: Selects specific collection deposit group
UI -> UGM: Query to add multiple people
UGM --> UI: Confirm people added
UI --> archivist: Confirm addition

== Remove People from Deposit Group ==
archivist -> UI: Request to remove people
UI -> UGM: Query to remove selected people
UGM --> UI: Confirm removal
UI --> archivist: Confirm people removed

== Set Deposit Window Closure Date ==
archivist -> UI: Access collection settings
UI -> CM: Fetch current settings
CM --> UI: Display settings
archivist -> UI: Set closure date
UI -> CM: Update collection with closure date
CM --> UI: Confirm update
UI --> archivist: Confirmation of closure date set

== Confer Permissions to Depositors ==
archivist -> UI: Request to confer permissions
UI -> PS: Fetch default collection permissions
PS --> UI: Display default permissions
UI -> PS: Apply to all depositors in group
PS --> UI: Confirm permissions applied
UI --> archivist: Confirm permissions conferred

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow an archivist would follow to add and remove people from deposit groups for specific collections in the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS). Moreover, it visualizes how an archivist sets the closure date of the deposit window and ensures that all permissions conform to the collection's default settings, through the interactions between the archivist and the system's interface, and the underlying systems handling user and group management, collection management, and permissions.

Remember, the actual implementation details might require adjustments depending on the specific system architecture, existing modules, and functionalities of your EDRMS project.

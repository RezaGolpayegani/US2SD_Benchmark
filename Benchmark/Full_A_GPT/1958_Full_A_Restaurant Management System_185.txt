Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a manager, I want to see the cost of ingredients so that I can change my supplier if needed" involves demonstrating the interaction between the manager and the system components involved in retrieving cost information for ingredients. Given the complexity of sequence diagrams and the limitations of textual representation, what follows is a representation in PlantUML code format. This code can be used in PlantUML tools to generate the visual sequence diagram.

This scenario includes interactions with the Restaurant Management and Operations System's backend, specifically through functionalities related to ingredient management, supplier management, and cost analysis.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Backend System" as BS
database "Database" as DB

M -> MI : Access ingredient costs
activate MI
MI -> BS : Request ingredient cost information
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query ingredient and supplier details
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return data
deactivate DB
BS --> MI : Display ingredient costs with suppliers
deactivate BS
MI --> M : Show ingredient cost and supplier information
deactivate MI

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Start**: The manager decides to review the cost of ingredients to assess the need for changing suppliers.
2. **Management Interface**: The manager interacts with the management interface, which is part of the Restaurant Management System. The interface could be a web page or an application screen dedicated to management tasks.
3. **Backend System**: Upon receiving a request from the management interface, the backend system processes the request to fetch ingredient cost information. This involves communicating with the system's database.
4. **Database**: The database stores all data related to ingredients, suppliers, and cost information. It performs a query operation to retrieve the requested information based on current supplier contracts and ingredient costs.
5. **Information Return**: The database returns the queried information to the backend system, which processes it (if necessary) before sending it back to the management interface.
6. **Display Information**: Finally, the management interface displays the ingredient costs along with supplier information. This enables the manager to make informed decisions regarding supplier changes.
7. **End**: The sequence concludes once the manager has reviewed the information.

This PlantUML code sketch provides a high-level overview of the interactions and does not delve into system-specific implementation details such as authentication or error handling, which are also important in a real-world scenario.

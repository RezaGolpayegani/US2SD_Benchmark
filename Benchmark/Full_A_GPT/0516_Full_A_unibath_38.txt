Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that represents the user story: As a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to query the entire archive, so that I can report on particular aspects of the archive holdings. This diagram illustrates the process starting from the administrator initiating a query to generating a report based on the archive holdings.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin as A
participant WebInterface as WI
database Archive as DB
participant ReportingTool as RT

A -> WI : Initiate query
activate WI

WI -> DB : Query archive data
activate DB
DB --> WI : Return query results
deactivate DB

WI -> RT : Generate report with data
activate RT
RT --> WI : Report generated
deactivate RT

WI --> A : Display report
deactivate WI
@enduml
```

In this sequence:

1. **Initiate query**: The interaction starts with the Bath Data Archive administrator ('Admin') initiating a query through the web interface ('WebInterface'). This could involve specifying certain search criteria to filter the data they are interested in.

2. **Query archive data**: The web interface then communicates with the database ('Archive'), sending the query to retrieve relevant data. 

3. **Return query results**: The archive processes this query and returns the results to the web interface.

4. **Generate report with data**: With the query results in hand, the web interface utilizes a reporting tool ('ReportingTool') to generate a comprehensive report based on the required aspects of the archive holdings. This could include information like total datasets, dataset usage statistics, citation counts, etc.

5. **Report generated**: The reporting tool processes the data and generates a report, sending it back to the web interface.

6. **Display report**: Finally, the web interface presents the report to the administrator, completing the process.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the interaction between the Bath Data Admin, the web interface, the archive, and the reporting tool to fulfill the admin's need to report on the archive holdings. Each interaction is simplified to focus on the main flow, assuming the existence of underlying infrastructure and authentication mechanisms to support these activities.

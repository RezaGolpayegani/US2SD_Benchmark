Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a member of the library, I want to search books by titles and authors so that I can see if the book exists," involves depicting the interaction between the user (library member), the system interfaces, and the backend components such as the database. The following is a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as M
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Search Controller" as SC
database "Library Database" as DB

M -> W : Enter search keywords \n(title/author)
W -> SC : Request book search\n(keywords)
SC -> DB : Query to find books by title/author
DB --> SC : Return search results
SC --> W : Display search results
W --> M : Show search results to Member

@enduml
```

Description of the Steps:
1. **Member (M)**: The library member starts the process by entering search keywords, which can be either the book's title, the author's name, or both into the web interface.
2. **Web Interface (W)**: The front-end web interface captures the search request from the member.
3. **Search Controller (SC)**: The web interface forwards this request to the search controller, which is responsible for handling search operations.
4. **Library Database (DB)**: The search controller then formulates a query to search for books matching the entered keywords in the library's database. This database contains all the information about the books, authors, and their availability.
5. **Results**: The database returns the search results to the search controller, which in turn sends the data back to the web interface.
6. **Web Interface (W) to Member (M)**: Finally, the web interface displays the search results to the library member, showing whether the book exists and its availability status.

This sequence diagram highlights the key components involved when a library member searches for books by titles and authors using the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) and elucidates how these components interact with each other to fulfill the user's request.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a user, I want to be able to limit my search to specified collection(s)" using PlantUML, you need to outline the interactions between the user, the system (which may include user input interfaces, search services, and the database or repositories carrying the digital assets information), and possibly other system components that facilitate the search within specified collections. Below is how you might structure the diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Search Interface" as UI
participant "Search Service" as SS
database "Digital Asset Database" as DB

User -> UI : Enter search query and specify collection(s)
UI -> SS : Parse search query and collection parameters
SS -> DB : Retrieve matching results from the specified collection(s)
DB --> SS : Return results
SS -> UI : Display search results
UI --> User : Show search results to User

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows the steps a user would typically take to limit their search to specified collections and how the system processes that request:

1. The **User** inputs their search query along with the specification of certain collections into the **Search Interface**.
2. The **Search Interface** captures this input and forwards the parsed query and collection parameters to the **Search Service**.
3. The **Search Service** processes this information to construct the appropriate database query or API call to retrieve only those results within the specified **Digital Asset Database** collections.
4. The **Digital Asset Database** executes the query and returns the matching results back to the **Search Service**.
5. The **Search Service** then sends these results to the **Search Interface**.
6. Finally, the **Search Interface** displays the search results to the **User**.

This is a simplistic representation; depending on the complexity of the DAMS (Digital Asset Management System) and the requirements, you might need to include additional details or steps, such as error handling (e.g., what happens if no results are found), authentication/authorization (if access to certain collections is restricted), or more intricate search logic that could involve sorting, filtering, or search relevance scoring.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the scenario where a site member wants to view the profiles of other members using PlantUML syntax involves visualizing the interactions between the user, system interfaces, and backend processes. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that depicts these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as user
actor "Member Profile Service" as MPS
actor "Privacy Setting Service" as PSS
actor "Database" as DB

user->MPS: Request to view profiles
MPS->PSS: Check privacy settings
PSS->DB: Fetch privacy preferences
DB->PSS: Return preferences
PSS->MPS: Privacy settings result
alt if profiles are public
    MPS->DB: Retrieve public profiles
    DB->MPS: Return profile details
    MPS->user: Display profiles
else if some profiles are private
    MPS->DB: Retrieve public + consented private profiles
    DB->MPS: Return allowed profile details
    MPS->user: Display allowed profiles
else
    MPS->user: Notify "All profiles are private"
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows the process:

1. The user initiates a request to view member profiles.
2. The Member Profile Service (MPS) requests the Privacy Setting Service (PSS) to check the privacy settings of member profiles.
3. The Privacy Setting Service consults the database to fetch the privacy preferences of the members.
4. The Database returns the privacy preferences to the Privacy Setting Service.
5. Based on the privacy preferences received, the Privacy Setting Service informs the Member Profile Service about which profiles are public, which are private but consented to be viewed, and which are strictly private.
6. Dependent on the result from the Privacy Setting Service:
   - If profiles are marked as public, the Member Profile Service retrieves all public profile details from the database and then displays these profiles to the user.
   - If some profiles have private settings but are consented to be viewed (e.g., the member allowed their profile to be visible upon request), the service retrieves and shows these profiles along with the public ones.
   - If all profiles are set to private without consent for viewing, the Member Profile Service notifies the user that all profiles are private.

Please note, this PlantUML sequence diagram simplifies the interaction for easier understanding and visualization. Actual implementation might involve more complex interactions, especially considering the need for authentication, error handling, and user preferences.

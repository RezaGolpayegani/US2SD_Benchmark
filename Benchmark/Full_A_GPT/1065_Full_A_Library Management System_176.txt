Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a library member, I want to see books according to the author so that I can see all books of my favorite author at the same time," involves illustrating the interactions between the library member, the web interface, the server, and the database. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that shows these interactions step by step.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryMember as member
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

member -> web : Enter author name
web -> server : Request books by author(name)
server -> db : Query books by author(name)
db -> server : Return query result
server -> web : Display books list
web -> member : Show books by author

@enduml
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Library Member (LibraryMember)**: Initiates the process by entering the name of an author into the search functionality of the web interface.
2. **Web Interface (Web Interface)**: Receives the search request from the library member and forwards it to the server for processing.
3. **Server (Server)**: Processes the request by asking the database to fetch all books that match the specified author's name.
4. **Database (Database)**: Executes the search query and returns the results to the server, which could include details like the book's title, publication year, genre, and availability status.
5. **Server (Server)**: Receives the list of books from the database and sends this information back to the web interface.
6. **Web Interface (Web Interface)**: Finally, the web interface displays the list of books by the specified author to the library member, completing the request.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation of the required interactions and processes to fulfill the user story using a Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

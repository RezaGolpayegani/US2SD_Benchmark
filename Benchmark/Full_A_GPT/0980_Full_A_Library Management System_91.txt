To illustrate the requested user story as a sequence diagram in Plant UML format, we're going to design a sequence that represents the interactions between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) when a librarian wants to view books that are currently unavailable. This scenario likely involves the librarian using a user interface to query the system and the system fetching and displaying the relevant data from its database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as LMS
database "Library Database" as DB

Librarian -> UI : Request to view unavailable books
activate Librarian
activate UI

UI -> LMS : Fetch unavailable books list
activate LMS

LMS -> DB : Query unavailable books
activate DB

DB --> LMS : Return list of unavailable books
deactivate DB

LMS --> UI : Show list of unavailable books
deactivate LMS

UI --> Librarian : Display unavailable books
deactivate UI
deactivate Librarian

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Librarian starts the interaction:** The librarian decides to view books that are currently unavailable and initiates the process by making a request through the user interface (UI) of the CLMS Dashboard.
2. **UI Dashboard forwards the request:** Once the librarian has made the request, the UI Dashboard acts as the intermediary, capturing the user's action and forwarding it to the Library Management System's backend for processing.
3. **Library Management System processes the request:** The Library Management System (LMS) receives the request to fetch a list of books that are currently unavailable. This system is responsible for handling and coordinating the logic for most library operations.
4. **Querying the Library Database:** The LMS communicates with the library's centralized database to retrieve information on all books that are marked as "unavailable."
5. **Database returns the data:** The Library Database processes the query and sends back the list of unavailable books to the Library Management System.
6. **Results are presented to the librarian:** Finally, the Library Management System sends the information back to the UI Dashboard, which then presents the list of unavailable books to the librarian.
7. **End of interaction:** The librarian now can see which books are unavailable and proceed with advising members accordingly.

This sequence diagram is streamlined to focus on the core flow of the "view unavailable books" feature from the librarian's perspective, showing the interactions between the user, the UI, the system backend (LMS), and the database.

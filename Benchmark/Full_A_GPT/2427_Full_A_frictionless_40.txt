Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story involves illustrating the steps that a researcher would take to work with data in NetCDF format and how the DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer (DPIE) system facilitates storing this data in plaintext while retaining its metadata. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Researcher as researcher
participant "DPIE System" as DPIE
participant "NetCDF Integration" as NetCDF
database "Data Storage" as storage

researcher -> DPIE : Request NetCDF data storage
activate DPIE

DPIE -> NetCDF : Initiate NetCDF integration
activate NetCDF

NetCDF -> storage : Extract metadata from NetCDF
activate storage
storage -> NetCDF : Metadata extracted
deactivate storage

NetCDF -> storage : Convert data to plaintext
activate storage
storage -> NetCDF : Data stored in plaintext\nwith metadata
deactivate storage

NetCDF -> DPIE : NetCDF data stored as plaintext\nwith metadata
deactivate NetCDF

DPIE -> researcher : Confirmation &\nAccess details
deactivate DPIE

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram starts with the Researcher requesting to store NetCDF data using the DPIE system. The DPIE system then interacts with the NetCDF integration component to handle the specific task of extracting metadata and converting the data to plaintext while retaining its metadata. The NetCDF component communicates with Data Storage to first extract metadata from the NetCDF files, followed by storing the actual data in a plaintext format along with its metadata. Once the operation is successful, the DPIE system responds back to the researcher with confirmation and details on how to access the plaintext data along with its retained metadata, providing a seamless and efficient way to work with NetCDF data. 

This visualization helps in understanding the flow and interactions within the DPIE system specifically tailored for researchers working with NetCDF data format, aiming to store it in plaintext while preserving metadata integrity.

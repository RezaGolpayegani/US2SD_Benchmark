To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story, "As a workshop attendee, I want to see a summary on major findings from the event," we consider several components and actors interacting in this particular scenario. The sequence diagram will follow the interactions from the request for a summary by the workshop attendee to the delivery of that summary.

Below is a conceptual outline in PlantUML syntax to illustrate these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Attendee
participant "Workshop Platform" as WP
participant "CMS" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Content Editor" as CE
participant "Summary Page" as SP

Attendee -> WP: Requests summary
WP -> CMS: Fetch request for summary
CMS -> DB: Query workshop data
DB -> CMS: Return workshop data
CMS -> CE: Generate summary content
CE -> CMS: Submit summary
CMS -> DB: Update with summary
DB -> CMS: Confirmation
CMS -> SP: Publish summary
SP -> Attendee: Display summary content
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

- **Attendee**: The user or workshop attendee who wants to see the summary of the major findings from the event.
- **Work modekiPlatform (WP)**: Represents the front-facing user interface or platform where the workshop is hosted or where attendees access workshop materials and summaries.
- **Content Management System (CMS)**: The backend system used for managing the creation and storage of digital content. In this scenario, it fetches workshop data and processes the content editor's summary.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores all the data related to the workshop, including raw findings, participant feedback, and other materials that can be used to generate a summary.
- **Content Editor (CE)**: A person or a function within the project tasked with generating a coherent summary of the workshop's major findings. This entity reviews the workshop data and compiles a meaningful summary.
- **Summary Page (SP)**: The specific page or section within the Workshop Platform where the summary is published and made accessible to the attendee.

This diagram simplifies the process flow and interactions but captures the core components and steps involved in generating and delivering a summary of the workshop's major findings to an attendee. Adjustments and additional details may be added as necessary, depending on the specific technical architecture and workflows of the NSF beta site development project.

To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to see orders," you'll need to detail the interactions between the system components involved in the process of a manager viewing orders. The primary components might include the Manager Interface (where the manager initiates the action), the Backend System (which processes the request), and the Database (where orders are stored). 

Below is a basic example of a PlantUML sequence diagram illustrating this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as m
participant "Manager Interface" as mi
participant "Backend System" as bs
database "Database" as db

m -> mi: Request to view orders
mi -> bs: Get orders
bs -> db: Query orders
db -> bs: Return orders data
bs -> mi: Show orders list
mi -> m: Display orders
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
1. The sequence starts with the Manager (`m`) requesting to view orders from the Manager Interface (`mi`).
2. The Manager Interface then requests the list of orders from the Backend System (`bs`).
3. The Backend System queries the Database (`db`) for the orders.
4. The Database returns the orders data to the Backend System.
5. The Backend System processes and sends this data to the Manager Interface.
6. Finally, the Manager Interface displays the orders to the Manager.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and can be expanded with more details. For instance, you could include error handling, more detailed steps for processing the request (like authentication and authorization checks), or interactions with other systems (e.g., a notification system that informs managers of new or updated orders in real-time).

Remember, the detail level in the sequence diagram should match the complexity of the system and the specific requirements of the project. Additional steps or components (like a cache layer or an analytics service) can also be added depending on the design of your Restaurant Management and Operations System.

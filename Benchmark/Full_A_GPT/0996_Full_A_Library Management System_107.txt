Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story of a librarian wanting to update the list of members in the context of the described Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) involves depicting interactions between different components of the system, such as the User Interface (UI), the Controller, the Database, and possibly other services like authentication or authorization services if we're considering access controls.

Below is a simplified example of a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates the process. This example assumes a basic flow where the librarian first logs in (for simplicity, login steps are not detailed), navigates to the member management section, selects a member, updates their information, and submits the changes, which are then reflected in the database.

```plaintext
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "UI: Member Management" as ui
participant "Controller: Member" as controller
entity "Database" as db

== Member Update Process ==
librarian -> ui : Navigate to Update Member
ui -> controller : Request Member Information
controller -> db : Query Member Details
db -> controller : Return Member Details
controller -> ui : Display Member Information
librarian -> ui : Edit Member Information
ui -> controller : Submit Updated Information
controller -> db : Update Member Details in DB
db -> controller : Confirm Update
controller -> ui : Show Update Confirmation
ui -> librarian : Display Update Success

This diagram shows the sequence of interactions for updating a library member's information from the librarian's perspective. Here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. **Navigate to Update Member**: The librarian selects the option to update a member's information from the Member Management UI.
2. **Request Member Information**: The UI requests the information of the member to be edited from the Controller.
3. **Query Member Details**: The Controller asks the Database for the member's current details.
4. **Return Member Details**: The Database returns the member's details.
5. **Display Member Information**: The Controller sends the member's information to the UI, where it's displayed to the librarian.
6. **Edit Member Information**: The librarian makes the necessary edits to the member's information through the UI.
7. **Submit Updated Information**: The updated information is submitted to the Controller.
8. **Update Member Details in DB**: The Controller updates the member's details in the Database.
9. **Confirm Update**: The Database confirms the update.
10. **Show Update Confirmation**: The Controller instructs the UI to display a success message or confirmation.
11. **Display Update Success**: The librarian sees a confirmation that the member's information has been successfully updated.

This is a simplified view focusing primarily on the librarian's interaction with the system to update a member's details. Depending on the system's complexity, you might also need to include error handling, authentication steps before allowing access to member details, and other potential interactions specific to the CLMS project requirements.

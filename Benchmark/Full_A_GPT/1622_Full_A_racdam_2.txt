To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story provided, we'd focus on capturing the interactions between the archivist and the digital archive system, specifically highlighting the process of marking individual files as restricted. The sequence will cover steps such as the archivist selecting the file, choosing to edit its access settings, and updating the file as restricted. Let's dive into the PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Archivist as archivist
participant "File Management System" as FMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Mark File as Restricted ==

archivist -> FMS : Select File
activate FMS

FMS -> FMS : Retrieve File Details
FMS --> archivist : Display File Details

archivist -> FMS : Choose to Edit Access Settings
activate FMS

archivist -> FMS : Mark as Restricted
activate FMS

FMS -> DB : Update File Access Level
activate DB
DB --> FMS : Confirmation
deactivate DB

FMS --> archivist : Confirm Update
deactivate FMS

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram begins with the **Archivist** selecting a file to mark as restricted. The **File Management System (FMS)** then retrieves and displays the file details to the archivist. Following this, the archivist chooses to edit the file's access settings, indicating that the file should be marked as restricted. The FMS updates this access level in the **Database**, which then confirms the update back to the FMS, and finally, the FMS confirms the update to the archivist, completing the process.

This code demonstrates a straightforward and focused interaction aligned with the user story of marking individual files as restricted to prevent accidental sharing. Once rendered, the diagram visually depicts each step in the sequence, emphasizing the logical flow from the archivist's decision to mark a file as restricted, through the system's processing of this action, to the final confirmation of the task's completion.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for a user story centered around developers depositing and maintaining datasets via an API (such as SWORD2) involves illustrating the interactions between the developer's service, the API, and the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. Since the description highlights operations like depositing datasets, managing versions, applying licenses, and attaching metadata, the sequence diagram will demonstrate these interactions.

Given the complexity and depth of this process, below is a simplified version to get started. This sequence diagram outlines the basic steps a developer's service might take to interact with the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform via the SWORD2 API.

Please note that to run this PlantUML diagram, you'll need to have PlantUML installed and running or use an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant DeveloperService as "Developer's Service"
participant SWORD2API as "SWORD2 API"
participant Platform as "Management Platform"

DeveloperService -> SWORD2API : Initialize dataset deposit
activate SWORD2API

SWORD2API -> Platform : Create new dataset record
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Validate dataset
Platform -> Platform : Apply default metadata
Platform -> Platform : Secure dataset storage location

Platform --> SWORD2API : Dataset record creation confirmation
deactivate Platform

SWORD2API -> DeveloperService : Confirm dataset deposit initialization
deactivate SWORD2API

DeveloperService -> SWORD2API : Send dataset metadata
activate SWORD2API

SWORD2API -> Platform : Update dataset with metadata
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Validate and store metadata

Platform --> SWORD2API : Metadata update confirmation
deactivate Platform

SWORD2API -> DeveloperService : Confirm metadata update
deactivate SWORD2API

DeveloperService -> SWORD2API : depositDatasetFile(filePath)
activate SWORD2API

SWORD2API -> Platform : Deposit dataset file
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Store file in dataset
Platform --> SWORD2API : Dataset file deposit confirmation
deactivate Platform

SWORD2API --> DeveloperService : Confirm file deposit
deactivate SWORD2API

DeveloperService -> SWORD2API : Apply license and embargoes
activate SWORD2API

SWORD2API -> Platform : Set license and embargo details
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Update dataset record
Platform -> Platform : Apply license
Platform -> Platform : Apply embargo rules

Platform --> SWORD2API : License and embargo update confirmation
deactivate Platform

SWORD2API --> DeveloperService : Confirm license and embargo application
deactivate SWORD2API

DeveloperService -> SWORD2API : Finalize dataset deposit
activate SWORD2API

SWORD2API -> Platform : Finalize and publish dataset
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Perform final checks
Platform -> Platform : Publish dataset

Platform --> SWORD2API : Deposit finalization confirmation
deactivate Platform

SWORD2API --> DeveloperService : Deposit successful
deactivate SWORD2API

To elaborate, this sequence diagram walks through the steps a developer's service would take to deposit a dataset through the SWORD2 API into the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. It includes initializing the dataset deposit, sending metadata, depositing the dataset file, applying licenses and embargo policies, and finalizing the dataset deposit.

This diagram is a high-level representation. Depending on the specific requirements, the interactions could become more complex, including handling errors, versioning datasets, tracking citations and downloads, or integrating with other university systems as mentioned in the project description. Additional sequence diagrams might be necessary to capture these complexities fully.

Creating a sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interactions between the faculty member, the digital repository system, and potentially other subsystems involved in the process of uploading data and providing a formatted citation. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FacultyMember as FM
participant AuthenticationSystem as AS
participant UploadModule as UM
participant Database as DB
participant CitationGenerator as CG

title Faculty Member Upload Data and Provide Formatted Citation

FM -> AS: Authenticate
AS --> FM: Authentication Success

FM -> UM: Navigate to Upload Interface
UM --> FM: Display Upload Interface

FM -> UM: Submit Data and Metadata
UM -> DB: Validate and Store Data
DB --> UM: Confirm Data Stored

UM -> CG: Request Formatted Citation
CG -> DB: Retrieve Data and Metadata
DB --> CG: Data and Metadata
CG --> UM: Formatted Citation

UM --> FM: Display Formatted Citation
FM -> UM: Copy Formatted Citation

note right of FM: Faculty Member shares \nthe citation for their work.

This sequence diagram starts with the faculty member authenticating themselves in the system. After successful authentication, they navigate to the upload interface provided by the Upload Module. The faculty member submits their data along with necessary metadata, which is then validated and stored in the database. 

Once the data is stored, the Upload Module requests a formatted citation from the Citation Generator. The Citation Generator retrieves the required data and metadata from the database to generate a formatted citation, which is then sent back to the Upload Module. 

Finally, the Upload Module displays the formatted citation to the faculty member, who can then copy it for sharing, ensuring proper attribution for their work.

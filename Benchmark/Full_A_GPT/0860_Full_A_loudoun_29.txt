To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story mentioned, we will assume a typical workflow involving the key actors and systems. Given the complexity and the potential for introducing specific technical details based on the County Services & Property Information Portal's underlying architecture, the following sequence diagram represents a generalized flow.

This diagram in PlantUML format outlines the steps a staff member would take to assign a hearing date for an application:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Staff Member" as staff
participant "Portal Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Application System" as appSystem
participant "Hearing Scheduler" as scheduler
participant "Database" as db
participant "Calendar System" as calendar
participant "Applicant" as applicant

== Assign Hearing Date for Application ==

staff -> dashboard: Login
dashboard -> staff: Display Dashboard

staff -> appSystem: Select Application
appSystem -> db: Query Application Details
db -> appSystem: Return Application Details
appSystem -> staff: Show Application Details

staff -> scheduler: Access Hearing Scheduler
scheduler -> db: Fetch Available Dates
db -> scheduler: Return Dates

staff -> scheduler: Select Date
scheduler -> calendar: Request to Schedule Hearing
calendar -> db: Check for Conflicts
db -> calendar: No Conflicts
calendar -> scheduler: Hearing Scheduled

scheduler -> db: Update Application with Hearing Date
db -> scheduler: Confirmation

scheduler -> applicant: Notify Hearing Date
scheduler -> staff: Display Success Message

### Explanation

- **Staff Member and Portal Dashboard**: The process begins with the staff member logging into the portal dashboard. The dashboard then shows the relevant interface based on the staff member's role and permissions.
  
- **Application System**: The staff member selects an application to assign a hearing date. The system queries and returns the application details from the database.

- **Hearing Scheduler**: The staff accesses a hearing scheduler module, which fetches available hearing dates from the database. With these dates presented, the staff member selects an appropriate date for the hearing.

- **Calendar System**: Once a date is selected, the system checks for scheduling conflicts and, finding none, schedules the hearing. The application in the database is updated accordingly with the new hearing date.

- **Notification**: The applicant is notified of the hearing date, ensuring they are aware and can prepare for the hearing.

- **Confirmation**: The staff member receives a success message confirming the hearing date has been assigned and recorded.

This sequence diagram is simplified and assumes the existence of system components like the Portal Dashboard, Application System, Hearing Scheduler, Database, and Calendar System, which together facilitate the assignment of a hearing date. In a real-world implementation, additional steps and system interactions (such as error handling and user authentication verification) would likely be necessary.

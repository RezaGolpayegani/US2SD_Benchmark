### Explanation:
- **Authenticate Staff Member**: The sequence begins with the staff member accessing the portal and being prompted to log in. The credentials are verified before access is granted.
- **Navigate to Affidavit Management**: Once authenticated, the staff member navigates to the section of the dashboard dedicated to managing affidavits.
- **View Pending Affidavits**: The system queries and displays a list of pending affidavits.
- **Review Affidavit Details**: Staff selects an affidavit to review its details.
- **Verify Compliance**: The staff checks if the affidavit complies with the required prerequisites using a compliance module which confirms the status.
- **Generate Compliance Notice or Request Additional Information**: Depending on the compliance status, the staff either marks the affidavit as compliant (and generates a compliance notice) or non-compliant (and requests additional information).
- **Log Out**: The sequence concludes with the staff member logging out.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions and processes involved in managing affidavits, ensuring they meet the required criteria before a hearing.

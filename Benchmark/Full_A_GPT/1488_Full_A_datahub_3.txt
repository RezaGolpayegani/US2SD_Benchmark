Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story provided involves illustrating interactions between the Publisher (user) and the various components of the Data Registry and Publishing Platform during the signup process.

Below is a simplified version of what this sequence diagram could look like in PlantUML syntax. To understand this diagram, note that PlantUML diagrams are defined in plain text, which then can be rendered into visual diagrams. This example diagram focuses on the steps a Publisher might take to sign up for an account through the platform, leveraging an external authentication service (such as GitHub or Google) for simplified sign-in, and then proceeding to publish a data package.

```
@startuml

actor Publisher
participant "Sign-Up Page" as Signup
participant "OAuth Service\n(GitHub/Google)" as OAuth
participant "Platform Backend" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Publisher Dashboard" as Dashboard

== Sign-Up Process ==
Publisher -> Signup: Visit sign-up page
Signup -> OAuth: Select sign-up method (GitHub/Google)
Publisher -> OAuth: Authenticate & grant permissions
OAuth -> Backend: Return authentication token
Backend -> DB: Create new user account
DB -> Backend: Confirm account creation
Backend -> Dashboard: Redirect to Publisher Dashboard

== Post-Sign-Up Guidance ==
Dashboard -> Publisher: Display post-sign-up guidance
Publisher -> Dashboard: Acknowledge guidance\n(Proceed to publishing)

== Data Publishing ==
Publisher -> Dashboard: Navigate to publish data
Dashboard -> Publisher: Show publishing form
Publisher -> Dashboard: Submit data package details
Dashboard -> Backend: Send data package for validation
alt Data Package is Valid
    Backend -> DB: Store data package information
    DB -> Backend: Confirm storage
    Backend -> Dashboard: Confirm publication success
    Dashboard -> Publisher: Display success message
else Data Package is Invalid
    Backend -> Dashboard: Return validation errors
    Dashboard -> Publisher: Display validation errors
end

This sequence diagram outlines the following major steps in the sign-up and data publishing process:
1. The Publisher initiates the sign-up process by selecting an authentication method provided on the sign-up page.
2. The Publisher is redirected to the chosen OAuth service (GitHub or Google) for authentication.
3. Upon successful authentication, the OAuth service returns a token to the backend of the Data Registry and Publishing Platform.
4. The platform backend creates a new user account in the database and confirms the creation back to the backend.
5. The Publisher is redirected to their new dashboard where they receive post-sign-up guidance.
6. The Publisher navigates the dashboard to publish a new data package.
7. The publishing platform validates the data package, storing it and confirming publication to the Publisher if valid, or returning validation errors if not.

Please note, this is a simplified diagram and actual implementation may involve more steps, checks, and interactions, especially concerning security measures during authentication and data validation processes.

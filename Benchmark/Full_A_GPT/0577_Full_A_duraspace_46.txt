Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a repository manager, I want to know all events occurring to a component over its lifecycle" involves representing the interactions between different system elements such as the repository manager, DIMS (DAMS Integration and Management System), and the database or underlying data storage system responsible for recording events. Since a detailed visual diagram cannot be rendered here, I'll provide a PlantUML representation of how such interactions could be diagrammed in text form.

Please note, the below PlantUML code assumes a simplified view of the process. Depending on your specific requirements, the interactions and components might need adjustments. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor RepositoryManager as RM "Repository Manager"
participant DIMS as sys "DAMS Integration and Management System"
database EventsDB as DB "Events Database"

== Track Component Lifecycle Events ==

RM -> sys : Request events for component
activate sys

sys -> DB : Query component events
activate DB

DB --> sys : Return events list
deactivate DB

sys --> RM : Show events list
deactivate sys

note right of RM : Events could include\ncreation, modification,\naccess, and deletion

@enduml
```

This code snippet represents the sequence of interactions initiated by the repository manager who wants to know all events occurring to a component over its lifecycle. The sequence diagram begins with the repository manager requesting this information from the DIMS. The system then queries the events database to retrieve a list of all recorded events related to the specified component. Upon receiving this list, the system presents it back to the repository manager.

Please ensure you have the PlantUML tool or extension installed in your environment (such as in Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, or online PlantUML tools) to visualize this diagram.

Keep in mind, the example provided is a simplified scenario focusing on tracking the lifecycle events of a single component. Real implementations may involve more complex interactions, especially if components are part of larger collections, or if events are categorized by type, severity, or other attributes.

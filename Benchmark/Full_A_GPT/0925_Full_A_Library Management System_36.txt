Creating a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story "As a librarian, I want to check where the book is so that I can easily find the book's shelf" involves detailing the interactions between the system's components to fulfil this request. Below is a simple representation of such a process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Library Management \nSystem (CLMS)" as system
database "Database" as db

librarian -> system : Enter book details\n(title/ID)
system -> db : Query book location
db -> system : Return book location details
system -> librarian : Display book location

@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Librarian Interaction:** The librarian initiates the process by entering the book details (such as title or ID) into the CLMS. This represents the librarian's action to search for the physical location of a specific book within the library.

2. **System Processing:** Upon receiving the request, the CLMS queries its backend database to find the book's location. This step involves the system processing the librarian's request and interacting with its database to retrieve the required information.

3. **Database Query:** The database receives the query for the book's location. It searches its records to find the corresponding shelf or area where the book is supposed to be located.

4. **Information Retrieval and Display:** Once the database finds the book's location, it sends this information back to the CLMS. The system then displays the book's location to the librarian, completing the process.

In this scenario, the sequence diagram illustrates a simple interaction flow where the librarian is enabled to quickly and efficiently find the location of a book within the library using the Comprehensive Library Management System. This enhances the librarian's ability to assist patrons and manage the library's collection effectively.

Generating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story in PlantUML requires breaking down the interactions between different components of the AMIDP system involved in detecting moving and transient objects in images. Let's structure this as a clear sequence of steps for a Zooniverse admin.

### Sequence Diagram: Detecting Moving and Transient Objects

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ZooniverseAdmin as Admin
participant "Admin Interface" as Interface
participant "Detection Module" as Detector
participant "AI & Machine Learning" as AIML
participant "Image Database" as Database
participant "Analysis Results" as Results

== Detection of Moving and Transient Objects in Images ==

Admin -> Interface : select images for analysis
Interface -> Detector : initiate detection process
Detector -> Database : fetch selected images
Database --> Detector : return images

Detector -> AIML : analyze images for motion and transients
note right of AIML: Utilizes pre-trained models\nfor object detection
AIML --> Detector : identified objects and motion data

Detector -> Results : compile and categorize findings
Results --> Interface : display categorized findings

Interface --> Admin : show analysis results

```

### Explanation

1. **Zooniverse Admin (Actor):** Initiates the process by selecting images for analysis through the Admin Interface.
2. **Admin Interface (Participant):** Acts as the bridge between the admin and the detection module, transferring the request to initiate the detection process.
3. **Detection Module (Participant):** This is the core component responsible for managing the flow of analysis. It fetchies the selected images from the Image Database and passes them to the AI & Machine Learning module for analysis.
4. **AI & Machine Learning (Participant):** This module performs the heavy lifting by analyzing the images to detect moving and transient objects. It utilizes pre-trained models specifically designed for this purpose.
5. **Image Database (Participant):** Stores all images and returns the selected ones for analysis upon request.
6. **Analysis Results (Participant):** Compiles, categorizes, and stores the findings from the AI & Machine Learning module. It then sends these categorized findings back to the Admin Interface.
7. **Admin Interface to Zooniverse Admin:** Finally, the interface displays the analysis results to the Zooniverse Admin, completing the process.

### Note
This sequence diagram abstracts complex interactions into manageable steps, highlighting the flow of data and control between different system components in the process of detecting moving and transient objects in images for a Zooniverse admin.

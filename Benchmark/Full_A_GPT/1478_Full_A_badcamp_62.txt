Given your request, I'm creating a PlantUML sequence diagram representation for the user story: "As an anonymous user, I want to register to speak at BADCamp, so that I can submit a session." Please note, to keep this example focused and concise, certain assumptions are made, including simplified steps and interactions. More complex authentication, validation, and error handling mechanisms that would be necessary in a real-world application are omitted for clarity.

The sequence diagram will outline the process starting from the user deciding to submit a session, through registering on the platform (since they start as anonymous), to finally submitting a session proposal.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Anonymous as "Anonymous User"
participant "Registration Page" as RP
participant "Database" as DB
participant "User Dashboard" as UD
participant "Session Submission Form" as SSF
participant "Review System" as RS

Anonymous->RP: Visit registration page
RP->DB: Check for existing user data
alt User not found in DB
    RP->RP: Display registration form
    Anonymous->RP: Submit registration info\n(Name, Email, Password)
    RP->DB: Create new user account
    DB->RP: Confirmation of account creation
    RP->Anonymous: Display success message &\nredirect to login
else User found in DB
    RP->Anonymous: Redirect to login page
end

Anonymous->UD: Login
UD->DB: Validate user credentials
DB->UD: Authentication success
UD->Anonymous: Display User Dashboard

Anonymous->SSF: Access Session Submission Form
SSF->SSF: Display session submission fields
Anonymous->SSF: Submit session details\n(Title, Description, Session Type)
SSF->DB: Store session submission
DB->SSF: Confirmation of submission received
SSF->RS: Submit session for review
RS->DB: Update session status to 'Under Review'
DB->RS: Confirmation of status update
RS->Anonymous: Notify user of successful submission and\nunder review status

This diagram represents a simplified flow from the perspective of an anonymous user who needs to register on the BADCamp platform to submit a session for consideration. After registering and logging in, the user accesses the session submission form, fills it out, and submits it. The session submission is then stored in the database and forwarded to a review system where its status is updated to 'Under Review', and the user is notified.

Keep in mind, this is a basic diagram. Depending on the actual complexity of the BADCamp platform, more actors (e.g., administrators or review committee members), systems (e.g., payment gateways for paid submissions), or subprocesses (e.g., an email confirmation step) could be involved.

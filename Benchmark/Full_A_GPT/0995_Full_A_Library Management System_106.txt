Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a librarian, I want to update bibliographical information for books." This user story focuses on the process involved when a librarian updates book details in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Please note, the sequence diagram assumes a basic flow where the librarian accesses the system, navigates to the specific book record, updates the necessary information, and then the system saves these changes to the database. 

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Librarian as librarian
participant "Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

== Update Bibliographical Information for a Book ==
librarian -> webInterface : Access update book feature
web_wf: Authenticate librarian role
alt authentication success
  webInterface -> server : Request book details
  server -> db : Query book information
  db --> server : Return book information
  server --> webInterface : Display book information
  webInterface -> librarian : Show book details form

  librarian -> webInterface : Update and submit book details
  web_wf: Validate updated information
  alt validation success
      webInterface -> server : Send updated book details
      server -> db : Update book information in database
      db --> server: Confirm update
      server --> webOut WF : Acknowledge successful update
      webInterface -> librarian : Show success message
  else validation failure
      webArgumentError Tanemo Error:Show error message
      webInterface -> librarian : Show error message and ask for re-submission
  end
else authentication failure
  webInterface -> librarian : Deny access, prompt for login
end

Key Points in the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Authentication**: The first step is authenticating the librarian to ensure that they have the permissions needed to update book records.

2. **Book Information Retrieval**: The librarian accesses the feature to update book information, which sends a request to the server to fetch the current book details from the database.

3. **Display and Update**: The web interface displays the book's current information, allowing the librarian to make changes. After updating, the librarian submits the updated details.

4. **Validation**: The updated information goes through a validation process. If it's valid, the process moves forward; otherwise, an error message prompts the librarian to correct the data.

5. **Confirmation**: Upon successful validation and update in the database, the librarian receives a confirmation message. If anything goes wrong, an error message is displayed.

This diagram outlines the general flow and interactions within the system for the specified user story. It is simplified for clarity and may need adjustments to reflect specific business rules, error handling, and technical architecture of the CLMS project.

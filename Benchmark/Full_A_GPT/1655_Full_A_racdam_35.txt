Creating a detailed sequence diagram to illustrate the process of sharing a link to a file on social media as described in your user story involves several steps and interactions between various system components and actors. Below is a PlantUML script that outlines these interactions, designed for the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project's context.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Researcher
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "File Management" as FileMgmt
participant "Social Media Share Service" as SocialMedia
participant "Database" as DB

== Share a Link to a File on Social Media ==

Researcher -> UI: Selects file to share
UI -> Auth: Validate user session
Auth --> UI: Session valid

UI -> FileMgmt: Request file link
FileMgmt -> DB: Query file metadata
DB --> FileMgmt: Return file metadata

FileMgmt --> UI: Display file link and social share options
Researcher -> UI: Choose social media platform to share
UI -> SocialMedia: Initiate share process with file link

alt Social Media Platform Integrations
    SocialMedia -> DB: Log share activity
    DB --> SocialMedia: Confirm log entry
    SocialMedia -> Researcher: Display share confirmation
else Social Media Sharing via External Browser/Application
    SocialMedia -> Researcher: Provide share link and instructions
end

SocialMedia --> UI: Update UI with share status
UI --> Researcher: Confirm file has been shared

**Explanation**:

1. **Researcher**: The actor interacting with the system, aiming to share a file link on social media.
2. **User Interface (UI)**: The platform through which the researcher interacts with the archive's digital management system.
3. **Authentication Service (Auth)**: This component checks if the researcher is currently logged in and has permission to access and share the file.
4. **File Management (FileMgmt)**: Manages file metadata retrieval and presents the link to be shared.
5. **Social Media Share Service (SocialMedia)**: A hypothetical service or API integration allowing the direct sharing of content to selected social media platforms.
6. **Database (DB)**: Stores and manages file metadata, user sessions, and audit logs for shared activities.

This sequence commences with the researcher selecting a file to share, proceeding through authentication, file metadata retrieval, selection of a social media platform, and finally, sharing the link, which can either happen through direct integration or via manual sharing using external browser/application instructions provided to the researcher.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story using PlantUML, we first need to outline the interactions and main components involved in an executive accessing company data related to performance on the RecycleSmart platform. This involves entities like the Executive (User), RecycleSmart Platform (including its Data Access Layer and Database), and possibly analytics services or tools for performance data visualization.

Below is an example of how you might structure the PlantUML code to represent this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Executive as exec
participant "RecycleSmart Platform\n(User Interface)" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
database "RecycleSmart Database" as DB
participant "Analytics and Reporting\nService" as Analytics

exec -> UI : Accesses platform
UI -> AuthService : Authentication request
AuthService -> UI : Authentication response
alt Successful Authentication
    AuthService --> exec : Access granted
    exec -> UI : Requests company performance data
    UI -> Analytics : Fetch performance data request
    Analytics -> DB : Query company data
    DB -> Analytics : Return company data
    Analytics -> UI : Prepare performance report
    UI -> exec : Displays performance report
else Authentication Failed
    AuthService --> exec : Access denied
end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram breaks down the process as follows:

1. **Executive Accesses Platform:** The executive initiates the process by accessing the RecycleSmart platform.
2. **Authentication:** The executive is authenticated through the Authentication Service. This step ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
3. **Request for Company Performance Data:** Upon successful authentication, the executive requests access to their company's performance data.
4. **Fetch and Prepare Data:** The platform, through its interface with an Analytics and Reporting Service, queries the RecycleSmart Database for the required data.
5. **Display Report:** The Analytics and Reporting Service processes the data, preparing a performance report that is then displayed to the executive through the platform's user interface.

This example assumes a basic flow where an executive is authenticated and then provided with the requested performance data. Depending on the actual complexity and feature set of the RecycleSmart platform, there might be additional steps or services involved, such as error handling mechanisms, further data processing services, or integration with third-party analytics tools.

To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a moderator, I want to delete my account, so that account information and games are no longer stored," let's break down the process into key interactions between the system components and the moderator. I'll describe the scenario in steps and then provide the PlantUML code to visualize the interactions.

### Scenario Steps:

1. **Moderator decides to delete their account**: The moderator logs in and navigates to the account settings page.

2. **Request to delete account**: The moderator selects the "Delete Account" option, which triggers a confirmation dialog.

3. **Confirmation**: The moderator confirms the account deletion request.

4. **System validates request**: The system checks if the request is valid and if the moderator is authenticated to perform this action.

5. **Delete games and user data**: The system proceeds to delete all games associated with the moderator's account and then the account itself.

6. **Confirmation of deletion**: The system confirms that the deletion has been successful.

7. **Logout**: The session is terminated, and the moderator is logged out.

### PlantUML Code:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
actor Moderator
boundary SystemUI
control AccountService
database AccountDB

Moderator -> SystemUI: Navigate to account settings
Moderator -> SystemUI: Selects "Delete Account"
SystemUI -> Moderator: Display confirmation dialog
Moderator -> SystemUI: Confirms deletion

SystemUI -> AccountService: Request account deletion
AccountService -> AccountDB: Validate moderator authentication
AccountDB --> AccountService: Authentication confirmed

AccountService -> AccountDB: Delete associated games
AccountDB --> AccountService: Games deletion confirmed
AccountService -> AccountDB: Delete moderator account
AccountDB --> AccountService: Account deletion confirmed

AccountService --> SystemUI: Deletion success message
SystemUI --> Moderator: Show deletion confirmation
Moderator -> SystemUI: Acknowledge & Logout

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions for a moderator wishing to delete their account, covering the steps from initial deletion request to system confirmation of account and associated data deletion. It's important to tailor the diagram based on the specific implementation details and technologies used in the AEPT project.

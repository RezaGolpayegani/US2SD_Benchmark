Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram to illustrate the process of an Admin setting key configuration parameters for site deployment involves defining the actors, boundaries, entities, and control objects that interact during the operation. Below is a PlantUML code example reflecting this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin as admin
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "ConfigurationService" as ConfigService
database "ConfigDatabase" as DB

admin -> UI : Access Configuration Menu
activate UI

UI -> ConfigService : Fetch Current Configuration
activate ConfigService

ConfigService -> DB : Query Current Settings
activate DB
DB --> ConfigService : Return Settings
deactivate DB

ConfigService --> UI : Display Current Settings
deactivate ConfigService

admin -> UI : Update Site Title
activate UI

UI -> ConfigService : Update Configuration(Request)
activate ConfigService

ConfigService -> DB : Update Site Title
activate DB
DB --> ConfigService : Confirmation
deactivate DB

ConfigService --> UI : Update Success
deactivate ConfigService

UI --> admin : Display Success Message
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Admin intending to change the site title, a key configuration parameter. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Admin Access**: The Admin accesses the configuration menu through the UI Dashboard.
2. **Fetch Current Configuration**: The UI Dashboard requests the current configuration from the ConfigurationService, which queries the ConfigDatabase to retrieve current settings.
3. **Display Current Settings**: The ConfigurationService sends the current settings back to the UI Dashboard, which displays them to the Admin.
4. **Update Operation**: The Admin updates the site title through the UI, which then sends an update request to the ConfigurationService.
5. **Database Update**: The ConfigurationService processes this request and updates the site title in the ConfigDatabase. It then sends a confirmation back to the UI.
6. **Confirmation**: The UI displays a success message to the Admin, indicating the completion of the update process.

This diagram describes the sequence of interactions between the Admin, the UI, and backend services necessary to update key site configuration parameters, focusing on a common task such as changing the site title.

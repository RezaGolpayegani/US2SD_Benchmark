To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a librarian, I want to view book prices so that I can choose books for purchase," we need to define the actors, the system components they will interact with, and the flow of actions to achieve the goal. Keep in chaind this scenario involves initiating a book price lookup, querying the book database or external book price API, and returning the book prices to the librarian.

Here is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML that illustrates this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as L
participant "LibraryManagementSystem" as LMS
participant "BookDatabase" as BD
participant "ExternalBookPriceAPI" as API

L -> LMS: Request book prices
activate LMS
LMS -> BD: Query available books
activate BD
BD --> LMS: Return book list
deactivate BD

loop for each book in list
    LMS -> API: Request price for book
    activate API
    API --> LMS: Return book price
    deactivate API
end

LMS --> L: Display book prices
deactivate LMS
@enduml
```

Explanation:
- **Librarian (L):** Initiates the process by requesting to view book prices through the Library Management System (LMS).
- **Library Management System (LMS):** Acts as the intermediary between the librarian and both the book database and external book price APIs. It processes the request, fetches book details, and displays the prices to the librarian.
- **Book Database (BD):** Contains records of available books. It's queried by the LMS to get a list of book details (excluding prices) before fetching prices.
- **External Book Price API (API):** Represents an external service that provides real-time book prices. The LMS queries this API for each book to retrieve the most current prices.

The sequence diagram above is a high-level overview. Depending on the complexity of the process and interactions (for instance, handling errors or unavailable price information), additional details and components might be necessary.

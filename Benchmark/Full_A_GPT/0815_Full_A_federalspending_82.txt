Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story provided involves illustrating the specific interactions between the FABS user and the Broker platform system components involved in submitting a citywide as a Primary Place of Performance ZIP (PPoPZIP) and passing validations. Please note, the following sequence diagram is conceptual and simplifies complex system interactions for clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FABSUser as User
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Submission Module" as Submission
participant "Validation Engine" as Validation
participant "Database" as DB

User -> UI : Navigate to submission form
UI -> User : Display form

User -> UI : Enter citywide as PPoPZIP
UI -> Submission : Submit PPoPZIP data
activate Submission

Submission -> Validation : Initiate validation
activate Validation

Validation -> DB : Fetch validation rules
activate DB
DB -> Validation : Return rules

Validation -> Validation : Apply rules to PPoPZIP
alt All validations passed
  Validation -> Submission : Validation passed
else Validation failed
  Validation -> UI : Display error messages
  UI -> User : Show errors\nand request correction
  User -> UI : Correct PPoPZIP data
  UI -> Submission : Resubmit corrected data
  Submission -> Validation : Revalidate
  repeat 
    Validation -> Validation : Apply rules
  until All validations passed
  Validation -> Submission : Validation passed
end

Submission -> DB : Store submission data
DB -> Submission : Confirm storage

Submission -> UI : Confirm successful submission
UI -> User : Display success message

This sequence diagram outlines the basic flow from the FACP (Federal Audit Clearinghouse Posting) user's perspective for submitting citywide information as PPoPZIP and passing the validation processes. It starts with the user navigating to the submission form, entering the necessary citywide as PPoPZIP, and initiating the submission. The submission module then sends the data for validation. The Validation Engine checks the data against a set of predefined rules fetched from the database. If the data fails to meet any rule, the error is communicated back to the user via the UI, prompting for correction. Once the data passes all validations, it is stored in the database, and a success message is displayed to the user. 

This diagram assumes a simplified flow for ease of understanding and might not capture all possible scenarios and error handling mechanisms in complex real-world systems.

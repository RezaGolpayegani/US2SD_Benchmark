Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a Zooniverse admin, I want to identify the number of whales heard in a single audio file" within the context of the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) involves depicting the interactions between users, the system components, and services for the task specified. The below PlantUML code delineates this user story's flow.

Please note, to visualize this PlantUML code, you would need to use a PlantUML editor or integrator.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ZooniverseAdmin as admin
participant "AMIDP Interface" as interface
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Audio Analysis Service" as analysis
database "Media Database" as db

admin -> interface: Upload audio file
interface -> CMS: Verify admin and file format
CMS -> analysis: Send audio file for processing
activate analysis

analysis -> db: Request previous audio analysis data
db --> analysis: Return analysis data (if any)

analysis -> analysis: Analyze audio to identify whale sounds
analysis --> CMS: Return number of whale sounds identified
CMS --> interface: Display analysis results
interface --> admin: Show number of whales identified in audio

This sequence diagram follows these steps:

1. **Initiation:** The Zooniverse admin uploads the audio file to the AMIDP Interface, intending to identify the number of whales heard in the file.
2. **Verification:** The Content Management System (CMS) verifies the admin's credentials and the audio file's format before proceeding.
3. **Analysis Request:** The verified audio file is sent to the Audio Analysis Service for processing.
4. **Data Request and Retrieval:** The Audio Analysis Service may request previous analysis data from the Media Database to assist in or expedite the current analysis if applicable.
5. **Analysis Execution:** The service analyzes the audio to identify whale sounds. This process involves sophisticated audio recognition algorithms that can distinguish whale sounds from other noises.
6. **Results Compilation:** Once the analysis is complete, the number of whale sounds identified is compiled and sent back to the CMS.
7. **Results Display:** The CMS forwards the results to the AMIDP Interface, which then displays the number of whale sounds identified to the admin.

This sequence diagram encapsulates the process of identifying whale sounds from an audio file within the AMIDP framework, emphasizing interactions through technology layers while ensuring the process is coherent and aligned with the user story's needs.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a librarian, I want to enter details about books and their shelf number" involves illustrating the interaction between the librarian, the front-end of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the backend database. This diagram will show the sequence of messages and actions that occur from the moment the librarian decides to enter or update a book's details until these new details are successfully stored in the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "CLMS Frontend" as Frontend
participant "CLMS Backend" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Librarian -> Frontend : Access book management page
activate Frontend

Frontend -> Backend : Request current book details (if editing)
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Fetch current book details
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return book details
deactivate DB

Backend --> Frontend : Show current book details
deactivate Backend

Frontend --> Librarian : Display book details/edit form
deactivate Frontend

Librarian -> Frontend : Enter/update book details & shelf number
activate Frontend

Frontend -> Backend : Send new book details & shelf number
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Update/Add book details in database
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Confirmation of update
deactivate DB

Backend --> Frontend : Update successful
deactivate Backend

### Explanation:
- **Librarian**: Initiates the process by deciding to add a new book or update an existing book's details, then interacting with the CLMS frontend interface.
- **CLMS Frontend**: Serves as the interface through which the librarian accesses and interacts with the book management functionality.
- **CLMS Backend**: Processes the request from the front end, fetching current book details if editing (not shown for adding), and later, updating the database with the new book details and shelf number.
- **Database**: Stores all the book details and handles queries to fetch and update these details as per requests from the backend system.

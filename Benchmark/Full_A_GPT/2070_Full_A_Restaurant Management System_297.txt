Based on the project description and your request to generate a sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to modify orders," using PlantUML, the following is a detailed sequence diagram that describes the process.

Please note, to use the code, you will need a PlantUML environment or a compatible tool that can render PlantUML diagrams.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as WI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Kitchen Display System" as KDS
participant "Inventory Management" as IM
database "Database" as DB

== Order Modification Sequence ==

Waiter -> WI: Select the order to modify
activate WI

WI -> OMS: Request current order details
activate OMS

OMS -> DB: Fetch order details
activate DB
DB --> OMS: Order details
deactivate DB

OMS --> WI: Display order details
deactivate OMS

Waiter -> WI: Make modifications (add/remove items)
WI -> OMS: Update order with modifications
activate OMS

alt If item removed
  OMS -> IM: Update inventory
  activate IM
  IM -> DB: Adjust stock levels
  activate DB
  DB --> IM: Stock updated
  deactivate DB
  IM --> OMS: Inventory updated
  deactivate IM
else If item added
  OMS -> IM: Check stock availability
  activate IM
  IM -> DB: Query stock levels
  activate DB
  DB --> IM: Stock details
  deactivate DB
  IM --> OMS: Stock availability confirmed
  deactivate IM
end

OMS -> DB: Save updated order
DB --> OMS: Save confirmation
deactivate OMS

OMS -> KDS: Send updated order to kitchen
activate KDS
KDS --> WI: Update displayed to chef/cook
deactivate KDS

WI --> Waiter: Confirm order updated
deactivate WI

Explanation:
1. The sequence begins with the waiter selecting an order to modify through the waiter interface (WI).
2. The WI requests current order details from the order management system (OMS), which fetches the order details from the database (DB).
3. Once the details are retrieved and displayed to the waiter, they make the desired modifications (add or remove items) via the WI.
4. The WI sends the updated order to the OMS. Depending on whether an item is being added or removed, the OMS interacts with the inventory management (IM) system to either adjust stock levels (if an item is removed) or check stock availability (if an item is added).
5. The IM system adjusts or checks the inventory accordingly in the DB.
6. Once the inventory is updated or confirmed available, the OMS saves the updated order in the database.
7. The OMS then sends the updated order information to the kitchen display system (KDS) to inform the kitchen staff of the modification.
8. Finally, the waiter interface confirms to the waiter that the order has been successfully updated.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow and interactions between the waiter, interfaces, and systems for modifying an order in the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

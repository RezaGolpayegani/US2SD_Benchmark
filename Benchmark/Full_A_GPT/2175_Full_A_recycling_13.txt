To visualize how a user can view the user documentation for the RecycleSmart website, we will design a detailed sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax. This diagram will outline the interaction between the user, the web application, and any necessary backend components that facilitate the viewing of user documentation.

Please note, to run this PlantUML code, you will need access to a PlantUML processor or an environment where PlantUML is supported, such as an online editor or an IDE plugin.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor User as user
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Web Server" as server
participant "DocumentationService" as docService
database "DocumentationDB" as DB

== User Requests Documentation ==
user -> UI: Navigate to Help/Documentation section
activate UI
UI -> server: Request User Documentation
activate server

== Server Processes Request ==
server -> docService: GetDocumentation()
activate docService
docService -> DB: Query Documentation Data
activate DB
DB --> docService: Return Documentation Data
deactivate DB
docService --> server: Documentation Data
deactivate docService
server --> UI: Display Documentation
deactivate server

== User Views Documentation ==
UI --> user: Show Documentation Page
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram describes the following steps:

1. **User Requests Documentation**: The user navigates to the Help or Documentation section of the RecycleSmart web app, signaling their intent to view the documentation.
   
2. **Server Processes Request**: The web application's UI forwards this request to the web server, which in turn, calls the `DocumentationService` to retrieve the necessary documentation.
   
3. **Retrieve Documentation**: The `DocumentationService` queries the `DocumentationDB`, which holds all the data related to user manuals, guides, and any other relevant documentation content.
   
4. **Display Documentation**: Once the documentation data is retrieved from the database and passed back through the `DocumentationService` to the web server, it is then sent to the UI. Finally, the UI presents the documentation to the user in a readable and user-friendly format.

Each step in this sequence is essential to fulfill the user's request in a systematic and efficient manner, ensuring the user finds the necessary information to understand how to use the RecycleSmart web app effectively.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to create employee data so that I can register a new employee" using PlantUML, follow the steps outlined below. This diagram describes the sequence of actions that occur from the moment a manager decides to add a new employee to the system until the employee's data is successfully stored.

Note that this example assumes there is an interactive interface (such as a web dashboard) for the manager to input employee details, a backend service to process the data, and a database to store the employee information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

M -> UI: Access employee registration form
activate M
activate UI

UI -> Backend: Submit new employee data
activate Backend
deactivate UI

Backend -> DB: Save employee data
activate DB
deactivate Backend

DB --> Backend: Confirm data saved
activate Backend
deactivate DB

Backend --> UI: Display success message
activate UI
deactivate Backend

UI --> M: Show confirmation
deactivate M
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Manager accesses the registration form**: The process begins when the manager accesses the employee registration form through the management interface.
2, **Submission of new employee data**: After filling out the necessary information (like name, position, contact details, etc.), the manager submits this data through the interface.
3. **Processing by Backend Service**: The management interface sends the data to the backend service, where it's processed.
4. **Storing Data in Database**: The backend service then attempts to save the new employee's data in the database.
5. **Confirmation of Data Saved**: The database confirms that the data has been successfully saved by sending a confirmation back to the backend service.
6. **Success Message to the Manager**: The backend service informs the management interface that the operation was successful, and in turn, the management interface displays a success message to the manager.
7. **End of Process**: With the confirmation displayed, the process of adding a new employee is completed.

This sequence diagram outlines a generic flow and can be further detailed based on specific requirements, such, as the need for error handling (e.g., what happens if saving the data fails), or additional steps required before an employee can be fully registered (such as email verification or assigning initial training modules).

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the provided user story involves illustrating several entities and their interactions for adding a new menu item in the Restaurant Management and Operations System. The primary entities involved in this process could include the Employee (perhaps a Chef or Cook), the User Interface (UI), Backend Systems, and the Database.

Below is a simple example of how this could be represented in PlantUML syntax. This example assumes that adding a new menu item involves the employee inputting details through the UI, which then communicates with backend services to validate and store this information in the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as E
participant "UI: Web Application" as UI
participant "Backend Server\n(Node.js with Express)" as Backend
database "Database\n(MongoDB/PostgreSQL)" as DB

E -> UI : Selects 'Add Menu Item'
UI -> Backend : POST /menu-items {name, description, price, ingredients}
activate Backend

Backend -> Backend : Validate input data
alt Validation Success
    Backend -> DB : Insert new menu item
    activate DB
    DB --> Backend : Success
    deactivate DB

    Backend --> UI : Menu Item Added Successfully
    UI --> E : Display success message
else Validation Fail
    Backend --> UI : Display error message
    UI --> E : Show input errors
end

deactivate Backend
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with an `Employee` interacting with the `UI` by selecting the option to add a new menu item. The `UI` then sends this information to the `Backend Server`, which validates the input data. If the validation is successful, the backend attempts to insert the new menu item into the `Database`. Depending on the outcome, a success or error message is relayed back to the `Employee` through the `UI`.

Please note, the actual implementation details such as request handling, data validation, database operations, and error handling can vary based on the specific requirements of the project and its technical architecture. This example provides a generalized flow that might need adjustments to fit the real project scenario.

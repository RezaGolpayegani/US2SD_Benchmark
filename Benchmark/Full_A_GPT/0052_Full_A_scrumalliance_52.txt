Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story requires specifying the interactions between the objects involved in the process. This sequence diagram will outline the steps taken by a site editor to include a teaser with each article, starting from logging into the system to publishing the article with a teaser.

Here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that visualizes these steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Editor as editor
participant "Login System" as login
participant "Editor Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Article Management" as articleMgmt
participant "Article Editor" as articleEditor
participant "Database" as db

editor -> login: navigate to site
login -> editor: display login page
editor -> login: submit credentials
login -> dashboard: validate credentials
login -> editor: authentication failed [Optional]

dashboard -> editor: show editor dashboard
editor -> articleMgmt: select to create new article
articleMgmt -> articleEditor: open article editor interface
editor -> articleEditor: inputs article content
editor -> articleEditor: inputs teaser
articleEditor -> db: save article and teaser
db -> articleEditor: confirm save
articleEditor -> editor: show success message
editor -> dashboard: navigate back

```

This diagram assumes a typical workflow where an editor:
1. Navigates to the site and is presented with a login page.
2. Submits their login credentials.
3. Is shown the editor dashboard upon successful authentication (an optional branch could handle authentication failure).
4. Chooses to create a new article, opening an article editor interface.
5. Inputs the main content of the article and the teaser.
6. Submits the article and teaser to be saved in the database.
7. Receives confirmation that the article and teaser have been successfully saved.
8. Navigates back to the dashboard, potentially to perform more tasks.

To use this PlantUML snippet, make sure you have PlantUML installed and configured in your environment, or use an online PlantUML editor to visualize the sequence diagram. You might need to adjust the diagram according to the specific interactions and interfaces of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform project.

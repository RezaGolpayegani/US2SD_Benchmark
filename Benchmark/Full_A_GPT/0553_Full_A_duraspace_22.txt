To illustrate the process of a repository manager indicating the copyright status of an object in the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS) using PlantUML, consider the following sequence diagram. This example outlines the interactions among the System, Repository Manager, and the Database, detailing the steps from the repository manager's request to the system's response and database update.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS System" as DS
database "DIMS Database" as DB

RM -> DS : Indicate Copyright Status
activate DS

DS -> DB : Validate Manager Rights
activate DB
DB --> DS : Rights Validated
deactivate DB

DS -> DB : Fetch Object
activate DB
DB --> DS : Object Details
deactivated DB

DS -> DS : Prepare Update Form
DS --> RM : Display Copyright Status Form
RM -> DS : Submit Copyright Status
activate DS

DS -> DB : Update Copyright Status
activate DB
DB --> DS : Status Updated Confirmation
deactivate DB

DS --> RM : Confirm Update
deactivate DS
@enduml
```

This sequence opens with the Repository Manager initiating the process by selecting the object for which they want to indicate copyright status. The DIMS System then checks if the manager has the proper rights to perform this action, ensuring secure and appropriate use.

Upon confirming rights, the DIMs System retrieves the specified object's details and presents a form to the Repository Manager to fill in or update the copyright status. After the Repository Manager submits the updated information, the DIMS System updates this status in the database and confirms the update to the Repository Manager.

This diagram encapsulates a straightforward interaction flow, highlighting the critical steps and validations required to ensure data integrity and access control in the context of digital asset management.

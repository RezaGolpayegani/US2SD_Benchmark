Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a manager, I want to create coupons so that I can deliver them to my customers" involves picturing the interactions between the manager and the Restaurant Management and Operations System, including backend services and database access. Below is a representation of this process in PlantUML format.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as Interface
participant "Backend Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Interface : Access Coupon Creation Feature
activate Interface

Interface -> Server : Request to Create New Coupon
activate Server

Server -> DB : Check Existing Coupons
activate DB
DB --> Server : Provide Existing Coupons Data
deactivate DB

Server -> Server : Validate and Process Coupon Creation
Server -> DB : Save New Coupon
activate DB
DB --> Server : Confirm Save
deactivate DB

Server --> Interface : Confirm Coupon Created
deactivate Server

Interface --> Manager : Show Coupon Creation Success Message
deactivate Interface

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the basic flow from the manager initiating a request to create new coupons via the management interface, to the backend server processing this request - including checking existing coupons in the database, creating the new coupon, and confirming the creation back to the manager. The interactions are simplified for clarity, focusing on the major steps relevant to the user story.

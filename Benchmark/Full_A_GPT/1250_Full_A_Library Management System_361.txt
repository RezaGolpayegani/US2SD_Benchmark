Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the user story: "As a student, I want to ask for books that are currently unavailable," involves illustrating interaction between the student (client), the library management system, and other subsystems involved in handling the request for unavailable books. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Search System" as Search
database "Library Database" as DB
participant "Notification System" as Notify
participant "Reservation System" as Reserve

Student -> Web: Request unavailable book search
Web -> Search: Initiate search for book
Search -> DB: Query for book status
DB --> Search: Return book status (Unavailable)
Search --> Web: Display status to Student
Web --> Student: Show book is unavailable, offer reservation

alt Book Reservation
  Student -> Web: Opt to reserve the book
  Web -> Reserve: Process reservation request
  Reserve -> DB: Record reservation details
  DB --> Reserve: Confirmation of reservation
  Reserve --> Web: Show successful reservation message
  Web -> Notify: Schedule notification for when book becomes available
  Notify -> DB: Save notification request
  Web --> Student: Display reservation confirmation and info about notification
else Suggest Alternatives
  Student -> Web: Request alternatives
  Web -> Search: Fetch similar books
  Search -> DB: Query for similar books
  DB --> Search: Return list of similar books
  Search --> Web: Show similar books to Student
  Web --> Student: Display alternatives
end

In this sequence diagram:

1. **Student requests a search for an unavailable book**: The student interacts with the web interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to search for a book that is currently unavailable.

2. **Search System queries the Library Database**: The search request is processed, querying the library's database for the book's availability.

3. **Status returned to Student**: The database returns the book's status as unavailable, and this information is relayed to the student through the web interface, with an option to reserve the book.

4. **Book Reservation**: If the student chooses to reserve the book:
   - The web interface sends the reservation request to the Reservation System.
   - The Reservation System records the reservation details in the Library Database and confirms the reservation.
   - A notification request is saved by the Notification System to alert the student when the book becomes available.
   - The student is informed about the successful reservation and the upcoming notification.

5. **Suggesting Alternatives**: Alternatively, the student might request suggestions for similar books.
   - The Search System queries the database for similar books, using criteria like genre, author, or subject.
   - The database returns a list of similar books, which is displayed to the student.

This diagram illustrates the complexity and efficiency of the library management system in handling requests for unavailable books, including reservation and notification mechanisms, ensuring a streamlined and user-friendly experience for students.

Given the complexity of the project and focusing on the specific user story you provided, below is an outline and the PlantUML code to represent a sequence diagram for creating and submitting feedback forms within the Neurohub platform. This scenario assumes the system involves interactions between the supervisor, the Neurohub platform, and students.

The sequence outlines the steps from the supervisor creating a feedback form, the form being made available to students, and then students filling out and submitting the feedback form.

**PlantUML Code:**
```plantuml
@startuml
participant Supervisor
participant NeurohubPlatform as Platform
participant FormTemplate as Template
participant Student

== Create Feedback Form ==
Supervisor -> Platform : Log in to dashboard
activate Platform

Platform --> Supervisor : Display Dashboard
Supervisor -> Platform : Navigate to "Create Feedback Form"
Platform -> Template : Fetch Form Template
activate Template
Template --> Platform : Return Template
Platform --> Supervisor : Display Form Template
Supervisor -> Platform : Edit and Configure Form
Platform -> Platform : Save Form Configuration
Supervisor -> Platform : Publish Form
deactivate Template

== Student Interaction ==
loop Each Student
    Platform -> Student : Notify about New Feedback Form
    Student -> Platform : Access Feedback Form
    activate Student
    Platform -> Student : Display Form
    Student -> Platform : Fill Form
    Student -> Platform : Submit Feedback
    deactivate Student
end

Platform --> Supervisor : Compile and Display Submissions
deactivate Platform

**Explanation of the Sequence:**

1. **Create Feedback Form:**
   - The **Supervisor** logs into the Neurohub dashboard.
   - They navigate to a section for creating feedback forms.
   - The platform fetches a **Form Template** for feedback submission.
   - The supervisor edits and configures the template according to the course feedback requirements.
   - Once the form is configured, the supervisor publishes it, making it accessible to the students.

2. **Student Interaction:**
   - Each **Student** is notified by the platform about the new feedback form available.
   - Students access and fill the feedback form provided by the platform.
   - Upon completion, students submit their feedback.
   
3. **Compilation of Submissions:**
   - The platform compiles all submitted feedback and makes it accessible to the supervisor for review.

This sequence diagram accounts for a straightforward process from the creation of a feedback form to receiving student feedback within Neurohub. Adjustments may be needed based on specific platform capabilities or additional features not covered in the user story description.

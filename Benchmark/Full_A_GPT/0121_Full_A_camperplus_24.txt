To create a sequence diagram for the user story, "As a camp administrator, I want to be able to add parents, so that they can enroll their kids at camp," in PlantUML format, you'll need to visualize the sequence of actions and interactions between the entities involved, including the Camp Administrator, the Platform (system), and the parents. Below is a simple example to get you started:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Camp Administrator" as admin
participant "Camp Management \n & Communication Platform" as platform
participant "Parent Database" as database

admin -> platform : access system
activate platform

platform -> database : request to add new parent
activate database
database --> platform : confirm parent added
deactivate database

platform -> admin : displays confirmation
deactivate platform

admin -> platform : logs out
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Camp Administrator accessing the Camp Management & Communication Platform. Then, the platform interacts with the Parent Database to add a new parent. When the process is complete, the system confirms the action to the Camp Administrator.

Please note, this is a simplified model and can vary greatly depending on the specifics of your system's design, such as authentication steps, validation processes, additional functionalities (e.g., sending a welcome email to the parent), and error handling mechanisms. Depending on your requirements, you might need to expand and detail each step further.

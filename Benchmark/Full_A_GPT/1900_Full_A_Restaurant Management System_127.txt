Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the scenario where a manager wants to design the menu involves multiple steps: the manager inputs menu changes, updates get processed by the system, and finally, the updated menu is displayed. Here's a PlantUML code example that outlines this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management UI" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> UI : Access menu design feature
activate UI
UI -> BS : Request current menu data
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query current menu items
activate DB

DB --> BS : Return current menu items
deactivate DB
BS --> UI : Send current menu data
deactivate BS
UI --> M : Display current menu items
deactivate UI

M -> UI : Modify/add menu items
activate UI
UI -> BS : Submit updated menu
activate BS
BS -> DB : Update menu in database
activate DB

DB --> BS : Confirm menu update
deactivate DB
BS --> UI : Confirm update success
UI --> M : Display success message
deactivate UI
BS -> BS : Generate new menu version
BS --> UI : Forward updated menu
UI --> M : Display updated menu
deactivate BS

```

To use this code:

1. Install PlantUML or access an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy the code snippet into the PlantUML environment.
3. Generate the diagram to visualize the sequence of events when a manager designs the menu.

This diagram starts with the manager accessing the menu design feature in the management user interface. It shows the interaction between the manager, the management UI, the backend server, and the database. The manager's request for current menu items is processed, and then they modify or add new items. These changes are sent back to the database through the backend server. The database updates and confirms the changes, which are then communicated back to the manager, including a success message and an updated menu. The process involves awaiting and confirming updates at each step to ensure accuracy and consistency.

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a librarian, I want to be able to add new members," consider the following systems and actors:

- **Librarian**: The user who performs the action.
- **Web Interface**: The frontend through which the librarian interacts.
- **Application Server**: The server which processes the request.
- **Database**: The system that stores user data.

Given the systems and actors, below is a PlantUML sequence diagram illustrating the process of adding a new member by a librarian:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Application Server" as server
database Database as db

librarian -> web : Navigate to "Add New Member" section
web -> server : Request to add new member
activate server

server -> db : Check if member already exists
activate db
db --> server : Member does not exist
deactivate db

server -> db : Create new member record
activate db
db --> server : Member created successfully
deactivate db

server --> web : Display success message
web --> librarian : Show success message
deactivate server

@enduml
```

In this sequence:

1. The **Librarian** navigates to the "Add New Member" section through the **Web Interface**.
2. The **Web Interface** sends a request to the **Application Server** to add a new member.
3. The **Application Server** checks with the **Database** if the member already exists.
4. The **Database** responds that the member doesn't exist.
5. The **Application Server** then requests the creation of a new member record in the **Database**.
6. The **Database** confirms the member has been created successfully.
7. The **Application Server** sends a success message back to the **Web Interface**.
8. The **Web Interface** shows a success message to the Librarian, indicating the process is complete.

This diagram assumes a simplified flow focusing on the key interactions required to add a new library member. Additional error handling, authentication, and other intermediate steps may be included for a fully-featured system.

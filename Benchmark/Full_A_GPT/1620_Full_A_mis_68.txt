Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for the specified user story involves depicting interaction between the faculty member (user), repository dashboard, permission service, and potentially other system components such as a database or a user authentication system. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as FM
participant "Repository Dashboard" as RD
participant "Permission Service" as PS
database "Repository DB" as DB

== Grant Submit Permissions ==
FM -> RD: Navigate to dashboard
activate RD
RD -> PS: Request permission update page
activate PS
PS -> RD: Display permission update UI
RD -> FM: Display UI
FM -> RD: Paste list of NetIDs
RD -> PS: Validate and process NetIDs
activate PS
PS -> DB: Update permissions for NetIDs
activate DB
DB --> PS: Confirmation
deactivate DB
PS --> RD: Display confirmation message
RD --> FM: Show confirmation that DDR recognizes the NetIDs
deactivate PS

== Manually Remove Permissions ==
FM -> RD: Request to remove permissions
RD -> PS: Process removal request
PS -> DB: Update permissions in DB
DB --> PS: Confirmation of removal
PS --> RD: Update UI with confirmation
RD --> FM: Display updated status

== Set Submission Window ==
FM -> RD: Request to set begin and end dates
RD -> PS: Display date setting UI
FM -> RD: Inputs begin and end dates
RD -> PS: Update submission window in DB
PS -> DB: Store new dates
DB --> PS: Date update confirmation
PS --> RD: Inform about successful update
RD --> FM: Show success message

== Check Submission Status ==
FM -> RD: Request submission status page
RD -> PS: Query submission status
PS -> DB: Get submission data
DB --> PS: Return submission data
PS --> RD: Process and format submission status
RD --> FM: Display submission status screen

deactivate RD

This sequence diagram starts with the faculty member navigating to the repository dashboard to manage class members' permissions, including granting and removing permissions via NetIDs, setting a submission window, and checking the submission status. The process involves interactions with the Permission Service, which validates inputs, communicates with the repository database for updating permissions, setting date windows, and fetching submission statuses, and finally confirming the actions back to the faculty member through the repository dashboard UI.

Please note, the specifics of how the Permission Service validates and processes NetIDs, interacts with other components (like an authentication system), or how the Repository Dashboard is implemented, may vary depending on the actual system architecture and requirements. This diagram provides a high-level view suitable for initial discussions and planning.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story about adding a gamification feature among the top members of a library involves capturing the interactions between the system components and the users. Given that PlantUML code is a plain text, we’ll describe how each component should interact with each other in the context of this user story. 

In this scenario, we are assuming the gamification feature rewards members based on the number of books read, reviews written, or any other criteria determined by the library. This diagram will involve interactions between the Library Member, Gamification System (part of CLMS), Member Database, and Notification Service.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Member" as member
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Gamification System" as gamification
database "Member Database" as database
participant "Notification Service" as notification

member -> web: Access Gamification Feature
web -> gamification: Request Member's Activity Log
gamification -> database: Query Member Activity Data
database --> gamification: Return Activity Data

gamification -> gamification: Calculate Points and Rank
gamification -> database: Update Points/Rank
database --> gamification: Confirmation

gamification -> notification: Generate Achievement Notification
notification -> member: Send Achievement Notification to Member

alt Top Member Rewards
    gamification -> notification: Generate Rewards Notification
    notification -> member: Send Rewards Notification to Member
end

alt New Badge Earned
    gamification -> notification: Generate New Badge Notification
    notification -> member: Send New Badge Notification to Member
end

### Explanation:

1. **Access Gamification Feature:** The library member accesses the gamification feature via the web interface, indicating interest in viewing their gamification status or participating in the ongoing challenge.

2. **Request Member's Activity Log:** The web interface sends a request to the Gamification System to fetch the requesting member's activity log (e.g., books read, reviews written).

3. **Query Member Activity Data:** The Gamification System queries the Member Database for the member’s activities that are relevant to the gamification feature.

4. **Calculate Points and Rank:** Based on the retrieved data, the Gamification System calculates the member's points and their rank among other participants.

5. **Update Points/Rank:** The system updates the member's points and rank in the database.

6. **Generate Achievement Notification:** Depending on the member's new rank or points earned, the Gamification System generates an appropriate achievement notification.

7. **Send Achievement Notification to Member:** The Notification Service sends the achievement notification to the member, informing them about their new rank, points, or any other relevant achievement.

8. **Top Member Rewards (Optional):** If the member achieves a top rank or meets specific criteria, they receive rewards notifications.

9. **New Badge Earned (Optional):** If the member earns a new badge as part of the gamification feature, a notification is sent out to them.

This diagram serves as a basic framework. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the gamification feature, additional components and interactions might be necessary.

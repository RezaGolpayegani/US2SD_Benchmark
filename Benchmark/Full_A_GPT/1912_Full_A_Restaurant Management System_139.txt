To generate a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to edit prices of the menu," let's outline the specific steps involved in this process and represent them visually. 

The following sequence is a general workflow for how a manager might interact with the Restaurant Management and Operations System to edit menu prices:

1. **Manager logs in**: The manager accesses the system and logs in with their credentials.
2. **Access menu management**: The manager navigates to the menu management section.
3. **Select menu item to edit**: The system displays the current menu, and the manager selects the menu item whose price they wish to edit.
4. **Edit price**: The manager inputs the new price and confirms the change.
5. **System updates the menu database**: The back-end updates the menu database with the new price.
6. **Confirmation message**: The manager receives a confirmation message that the price has been updated.

Here's how you would represent these steps in a Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Login Interface" as Login
participant "Menu Management Interface" as MenuUI
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> Login: Enters credentials
Login -> MenuUI: Authenticates and redirects to menu management
Manager -> MenuUI: Requests to view current menu
MenuUI -> DB: Fetches menu items
DB -> MenuUI: Returns menu items
MenuUI -> Manager: Displays menu items

Manager -> MenuUI: Selects item to edit price
MenuUI -> Manager: Shows selected item details
Manager -> MenuUI: Inputs new price and confirms
MenuUI -> DB: Updates the item price
DB -> MenuUI: Confirms update
MenuUI -> Manager: Shows confirmation message

This UML sequence diagram outlines the process a manager would follow to edit the prices of menu items using the Restaurant Management and Operations System. It starts with the manager logging in, progresses through selecting and editing a menu item's price, and ends with the database being updated and the manager receiving a confirmation message. Remember that the actual implementation details might vary based on the specific technologies used and the system's design.

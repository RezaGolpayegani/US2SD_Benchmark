Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML requires breaking down the interaction steps involved in promoting and using open standards for data deposit. Below is a PlantUML script that visualizes the necessary steps a Bath Data Archive administrator might take to accomplish this objective.

```plaintext
@startuml
participant Administrator as Admin
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Data Deposit System" as DDS

Web -> Depositor: Display Deposit Form

Depositor -> Web: Submit Dataset with Metadata
Web -> DDS: Validate Metadata against Open Standards
alt Metadata Valid
    DDS -> API: Apply Open Standards to Metadata
    API -> DDS: Confirm Standards Application
    DDS -> Repo: Deposit Dataset
    Repo -> DDS: Acknowledge Deposit
    DDS -> Depositor: Deposit Successful Message
else Metadata Invalid
    DDS -> Depositor: Error Message with Guidelines
end

This diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Encouraging the Use of Open Standards for Data Deposit:**
   - The Bath Data Archive administrator accesses and updates the deposit guidelines through a web interface to include recommendations for using open standards.
   - The updated guidelines are then made available for depositors via the data deposit system's web interface.

2. **Depositing Dataset Using Open Standards:**
   - Depositors navigate to the dataset deposit section and fill out a deposit form that is now updated to include information on open standards.
   - Upon submitting the dataset with metadata, the system validates this metadata against the open standards requirements.
   - If the metadata is valid and adheres to the open standards, the system processes it accordingly and deposits the dataset into the repository.
   - If the metadata does not conform to the open standards, an error message along with the guidelines is provided to the depositor for correction.

This sequence diagram conceptualizes a user story for promoting open standards use in the context of a data archive system specifically tailored for the University of Bathâ€™s Enhanced Research Data Management Platform project.

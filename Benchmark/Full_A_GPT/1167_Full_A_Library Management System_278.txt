To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to search books by author, so that I can quickly search for an author's book" using PlantUML, follow the syntax below. This diagram outlines the process a library system (Comprehensive Library Management System - CLMS) would undergo allowing a member to search for books by an author's name.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Member
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Authentication Module" as Auth
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Results Display" as RD

== Search for Books by Author ==

Member -> SI: Enter Author Name
SI -> Auth: Validate Member Session
Auth --> SI: Session Valid

SI -> DB: Query for Books by Author(Name)
DB -> DB: Search Books
DB --> SI: Return Book List

SI -> RD: Display Results to Member
RD --> Member: List of Books by Author

```

### Explanation:

1. **Member Interaction**: The sequence begins with the Member entering the author's name into the Search Interface. This represents the direct interaction from the user to initiate the search.

2. **Session Validation**: Before proceeding with the search, the system checks if the member's session is valid through the Authentication Module. This step ensures that the user is logged in and authorized to make the search query.

3. **Database Query**: Once the session is validated, the Search Interface sends a query to the Database to retrieve books by the specified author. The Database processes this request, performing a search within its records.

4. **Display Results**: The Database returns a list of books that match the search criteria. The Search Interface then forwards these results to the Results Display, which presents the list of books by the specified author to the Member.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of operations in the CLMS when a member wishes to search for books by an author. It emphasizes the system's components interaction, ensuring a streamlined process for the user's request.

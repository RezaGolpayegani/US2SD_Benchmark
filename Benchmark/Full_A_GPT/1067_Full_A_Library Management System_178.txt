Given your requirements, below is a detailed sequence diagram expressed in PlantUML format that outlines the process flow for the user story: "As a library member, I want to see the due dates of the books that I have borrowed in my profile." This diagram assumes a basic architecture where the user interacts with a frontend application (web or mobile), which communicates with a backend server, which in turn retrieves data from a database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "Frontend Application" as frontend
participant "Backend Server" as backend
participant "Database" as db

member -> frontend : Open profile
frontend -> backend : Request member's borrowed books data
backend -> db : Query borrowed books and due dates
db -> backend : Return borrowed books data
backend -> frontend : Send borrowed books and due dates
frontend -> member : Display borrowed books with due dates

note over member, frontend : The member views \n the due dates in their profile

@enduml
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Member Interaction:** The sequence begins with the member (library user) opening their profile within the front-end application, signalling the need to view the borrowed books and their due dates.

2  **Frontend to Backend Request:** The frontend application sends a request to the backend server to fetch the data regarding the member's borrowed books. This includes identifying which books the member currently has and the due dates for each item.

3. **Backend to Database Query:** The backend server processes this request and queries the database to retrieve the specific data related to the borrowed books and their respective due dates.

4. **Database Response:** The database processes this query and returns the data concerning the member's borrowed books, including the title, author, and crucially, the due dates of these books.

5. **Data Presentation:** The backend server forwards this data to the frontend application, which then presents the information to the member. The member can see a list (or another form of display like a table) of the books they have borrowed along with the due dates for each book. 

6. **Member Views Data:** Finally, the sequence diagram encapsulates the end goal, which is for the member to view the due dates of the borrowed books through their profile interface in the application.

This sequence diagram captures the flow of interactions initiated by a library member wishing to view the due dates of their borrowed books, streamlined through the frontend and backend communications, down to the data retrieval from the database.

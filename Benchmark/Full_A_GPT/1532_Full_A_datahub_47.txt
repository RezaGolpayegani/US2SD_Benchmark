Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for a specific user action represents a critical step in software design, offering a clear visualization of how system components interact to accomplish a given task. Here's a detailed sequence diagram written in the PlantUML language, focusing on the user story: "As a Consumer, I want to view a DataPackage at a particular version online."

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant WebUI as WUI
participant APIGateway as API
participant AuthService as Auth
participant DatasetService as DS
participant VersionControl as VC
participant Storage as S

U -> WUI : Navigate to specific DataPackage
WUI -> API : Request for DataPackage (with version)
API -> Auth : Validate User Session
Auth -> API : Session Validated

API -> DS : Query DataPackage Version Info
DS -> VC : Request specific version details
VC -> DS : Return version metadata
DS -> API : Return DataPackage metadata

API -> S : Request DataPackage at Version
S -> API : Return DataPackage Data
API -> WUI : Respond with DataPackage Data
WUI -> U : Display DataPackage Version

```

This sequence diagram breaks down the process flow from the user's perspective of viewing a specific version of a DataPackage online, utilizing a system architecture comprising several key components:

- **User (U):** Represents the consumer attempting to access a particular version of a DataPackage.
- **WebUI (WUI):** The user interface where the consumer interacts with the platform.
- **APIGateway (API):** Acts as the intermediary, processing requests and routing them to appropriate services.
- **AuthService (Auth):** Responsible for validating user sessions, ensuring that only authenticated users can access version-specific data.
- **DatasetService (DS):** Manages queries related to DataPackages, including retrieving version information.
- **VersionControl (VC):** Maintains records of different DataPackage versions, facilitating access to specific snapshots of the data.
- **Storage (S):** Where the actual data of the DataPackages is stored. This component is responsible for retrieving and serving data at the requested version.

This diagram captures the interaction flow, starting with the user's request through the web UI and threading through system components to fetch and render the requested DataPackage version. Each interaction is designed to ensure data integrity, proper access control, and a seamless user experience, ultimately enabling the User to view and present the specific data timeslice of interest.

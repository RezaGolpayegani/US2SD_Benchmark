Given the complexity and breadth of the DMPTool features and the specific needs outlined in your user story, creating a sequence diagram involves breaking down interactions among various components and stakeholders to capture the flow in generating and delivering regular summary reports on research data usage trends. Below is a basic outline in PlantUML format for a sequence diagram based on the stated requirements.

This simplified example focuses on interactions between the Postgraduate Convenor (as the end user), the DMPTool system, and underlying database or data analytics modules that generate and dispatch the summary reports. The diagram assumes a trigger or scheduled task initiates the report generation.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Postgraduate_Convenor as PC
participant DMPTool_System as DS
participant Data_Analytics_Module as DAM
participant Database as DB
participant Email_Service as ES

== Trigger Report Generation ==
PC -> DS : Request Summary Report\n(Trigger/Schedule)
activate DS

DS -> DAM : Initiate Data Analysis for Trends
activate DAM

DAM -> DB : Fetch Research Data Usage
activate DB
DB --> DAM : Return Data
deactivate DB

DAM --> DS : Analysis Result
deactivate DAM

DS -> ES : Send Summary Report via Email
activate ES
ES -> PC : Email Summary Report
deactivate ES

PC -> DS : Acknowledge Receipt
DS --> PC : End
deactivate DS

### Understanding the Diagram
- **Trigger Report Generation:** The Postgraduate Convenor (your user) either triggers a request for a summary report or a scheduled task does so.
- **System Processing:** The DMPTool System (DS) receives the request and instructs the Data Analytics Module (DAM) to analyze data trends.
- **Data Fetching and Analysis:** The DAM fetches the required data from a database (DB), analyzes it for trends relevant to the Convenorâ€™s interest, and passes the results back to the DMPTool System.
- **Report Dispatch:** The System then uses an Email Service (or similar notification service) to compile and send the summary report back to the Postgraduate Convenor.
- **Completion:** The Convenor acknowledges receipt of the report, concluding the process.

This diagram is a simplification and might need adjustments depending on the specific architecture of DMPTool, the complexity of data being analyzed, and the manner in which summary reports are generated and dispatched (e.g., web dashboard, direct email, etc.). Furthermore, additional steps or interactions could be included for error handling, user authentication, and more detailed data processing based on the actual implementation details of the DMPTool.

To capture the user story of creating a style, design, and content guide using a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, it's important to outline the key interactions between the designer and other components within the development process. This scenario assumes collaboration amongst team members and resources, like the content management system (CMS) and the repository for guides (GitHub or a similar platform).

Below is a basic PlantUML sequence diagram example illustrating these interactions for your user story. This diagram assumes the process initiates with the designer's need for guidelines and includes engagement with team members and accessing a collaboratively maintained guide repository.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Designer as D
participant "Team Member" as TM
participant "Guide Repository\n(GitHub)" as GR
database CMS

D -> TM : Request existing guides and standards
TM --> D : Share link to Guide Repository\nand CMS access
D -> GR : Access repository
activate GR
GR -> D : Display available guides\n(Style, Design, Content)
deactivate GR
D -> D : Review and compile relevant information
D -> CMS : Apply guides in design process
activate CMS
CMS -> D : Confirm application of guides
deactivate CMS
D -> GR : Update repository with new/modified guides
activate GR
GR -> D : Confirm update
deactivate GR
D --> TM : Share updated guides
TM -> TM : Review and provide feedback
TM --> D : Confirm adoption of guides

This sequence diagram illustrates a simple process where:
1. The Designer requests existing style, design, and content guides from Team Members.
2. Team Members provide access to the Guide Repository and the CMS.
3. The Designer accesses and reviews available guides in the repository.
4. The Designer then applies these guides within the CMS for design tasks.
5. Any new or updated guides produced by the Designer are uploaded back to the repository.
6. The Designer shares these updated guides with Team Members for feedback and confirmation of adoption, completing the loop.

Keep in mind, every project might have variations in workflow and tooling, and therefore, this diagram may need adjustments to fit specific project contexts accurately.

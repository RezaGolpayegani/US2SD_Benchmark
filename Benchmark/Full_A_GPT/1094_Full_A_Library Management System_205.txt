Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story "As a manager, I want to delete subscriber accounts so that I can delete accounts when requested" involves illustrating the interactions between different entities such as the Manager, the Library Management System Interface, and the Database. Here's how you can represent this sequence in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "LibraryManagementSystemInterface" as Interface
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Interface : requestAccountDeletion(userID)
activate Interface

Interface -> DB : verifyManagerPermissions(managerID)
activate DB
DB --> Interface : permissionGranted
deactivate DB

Interface -> DB : deleteAccount(userID)
activate DB
DB --> Interface : accountDeletionSuccess
deactivate DB

Interface -> Manager : showDeletionConfirmation()
deactivate Interface

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram begins with the Manager initiating a request to delete a subscriber account by providing the user ID. The Library Management System Interface (labeled as `LibraryManagementSystemInterface`) then interacts with the Database to verify the manager's permissions. Once the permissions are verified and granted, the Interface requests the Database to delete the specified account. After the Database confirms successful account deletion, the Interface informs the Manager by showing a deletion confirmation.

Note: This is a simplified schematic focusing on the main interactions involved in the process. Depending on the complexity and requirements of your system, you might need to add more details such as error handling (e.g., what happens if the account cannot be found or if the manager does not have adequate permissions), logging of the deletion action, or interactions with other components or services for audit and compliance purposes.

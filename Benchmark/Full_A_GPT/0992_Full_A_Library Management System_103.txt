To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to update booklists" using PlantUML, we need to outline the steps involved in this process and define the entities that will interact with each other. Below is a basic example of how this sequence might be depicted in PlantUML syntax.

This diagram will cover the following steps:
1. The librarian accesses the library management system (perhaps through a web interface).
2. The librarian selects the option to update book details/books list.
3. The librarian searches for a book or selects a book from a list.
4. The librarian modifies the necessary details (like title, author, ISBN, availability, etc.).
5. The system validates the changes and updates the database.
6. A confirmation message is shown to the librarian.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem Interface" as UI
database "CLMS Database" as DB

== Update Booklists ==

librarian -> UI : Accesses Library Management System
UI --> librarian : Show Dashboard

librarian -> UI : Selects Update Book Option
UI --> librarian : Display Book Search / List

librarian -> UI : Searches/Selects Book to Update
UI -> DB : Fetch Book Details
DB --> UI : Return Book Details
UI --> librarian : Show Book Details

librarian -> UI : Modifies Book Details (title, author, etc.)
UI -> DB : Validate & Update Details
DB --> UI : Confirmation of Update

UI --> librarian : Display Confirmation Message

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the interaction between a librarian (actor), the library management system interface (participant), and the database (database) in the process of updating booklists. The steps include accessing the system, selecting the update option, searching/selecting a book, modifying details, validating and updating these details in the database, and finally displaying a confirmation message.

For a more detailed diagram, consider including error handling (e.g., what happens if the book isn't found or the database update fails) or more specific interaction steps (e.g., logging into the system, more detailed browsing options).

Remember, PlantUML diagrams can be customized extensively. The above example focuses on a straightforward flow; depending on your requirements, you might need to add more details about the process, interactions, or technology stack involved.

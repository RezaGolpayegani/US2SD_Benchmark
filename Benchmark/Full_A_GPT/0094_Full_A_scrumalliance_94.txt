Given your requirement, I'll provide a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a member, I want to receive a reminder and a link, so that I can renew my membership."

Please note, due to the nature of plaintext format, this diagram may need to be interpreted by a PlantUML compiler or an environment that supports PlantUML (such as various online editors or development environments with PlantUML integration) to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as member
participant System as system

participant Database as db

### Explanation of Steps in the Sequence Diagram

1. **Member Checks Status**: The member initiates a check on their membership status.
2. **Retrieve Membership Details**: The system retrieves the member's expiry date from the database.
3. **Calculate Days to Expiry**: The system calculates if the membership is nearing expiry.
4. **Decision Branch**: If the membership is not near expiry, no action is needed. Otherwise, a renewal reminder process starts.
5. **Trigger Reminder**: The system triggers an email service to send a renewal reminder to the member.
6. **Member Receives Reminder**: The member receives an email with a reminder and a link to renew their membership.
7. **Member Clicks Renewal Link**: Upon clicking the link, the member is directed to the renewal page presented by the system.
8. **Display Renewal Options**: The system displays various renewal options to the member.
9. **Submit Renewal**: The member submits a form with their renewal preferences.
10. **Update Membership Details**: The system updates the membership details in the database post-renewal submission.
11. **Renewal Confirmation**: Finally, the system sends a renewal confirmation message to the member, completing the process.

This diagram assumes the interaction primarily starts with the member's action or the system's automated reminder for membership renewal and concludes with the membership renewal confirmation. Adjustments may be needed depending on the specifics of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform infrastructure and technologies used.

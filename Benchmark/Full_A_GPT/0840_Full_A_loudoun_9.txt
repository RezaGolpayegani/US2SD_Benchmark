Given your request, I'll provide a basic template for a sequence diagram using Plant UML syntax. This template will outline the process for an applicant wanting to modify their application on the County Services & Property Information Portal. Note that specific implementation details may vary based on the underlying system architecture and requirements. This example focuses on a simplified sequence illustrating just a few potential system interactions involved in modifying an application.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Applicant
participant "Customer Portal" as Portal
participant "Application System" as AppSystem
participant "Database" as DB

== Application Modification ==

Applicant -> Portal : Request to modify application
Portal -> AppSystem : Validate user and fetch application details
activate AppSystem

AppSystem -> DB : Query application details
activate DB
DB -> AppSystem : Return application details
deactivate DB

AppSystem -> Portal : Display application details
Portal -> Applicant : Show application form with data
Applicant -> Portal : Submit modified application
Portal -> AppSystem : Process application modifications

activate AppSystem
AppSystem -> DB : Update application details
activate DB
DB --> AppSystem : Confirm update
deactivate DB

AppSystem --> Portal : Confirm modification success
Portal --> Applicant : Display modification success message

This sequence diagram starts with the Applicant initiating a request to modify an application through the Customer Portal. The Portal then interacts with the Application System to validate the user and fetch the original application details stored in the Database. Upon retrieval, the application details are displayed back to the Applicant, who then submits the modified application. The Application System processes these modifications, updates the Database, and confirms the successful update back to the Applicant through the Portal.

Please remember, this is a simplified view aimed at demonstrating the basic flow for an application modification process. Depending on the requirements, the system might involve more detailed steps like authentication checks, input validations, notification systems for status updates, and logs for tracking user activities or changes. You should adapt and expand this template based on the specific needs of your project and the detailed functionalities of your system.

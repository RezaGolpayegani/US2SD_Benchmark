Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a staff, I want to add borrowed books to the system with their due dates" involves laying out the interactions between the system components involved in this process. This sequence will include interactions from the staff member's initiation of the book borrowing process, to the system updating the database with the borrow details including book ID, borrower's ID, and due dates.

Here's how you could represent this in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Staff
participant "Borrowing Interface" as BInterface
participant "Validation System" as Validator
participant "Database" as DB

Staff -> BInterface: Enter book and borrower details
BInterface -> Validator: Validate book and borrower details
activate Validator
Validator --> BInterface: Validation Status
deactivate Validator

alt If details are valid
    BInterface -> DB: Add borrowing details \n(Book ID, Borrower ID, Due Date)
    activate DB
    DB --> BInterface: Operation Status (Success/Failure)
    deactivate DB
    BInterface --> Staff: Show operation status (Book borrowed successfully)
else If details are invalid
    BInterface --> Staff: Show error (Invalid details)
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the staff member entering details of the borrowed book and the borrower into the Borrowing Interface. The entered details are then validated by the Validation System. If the details are valid, the Borrowing Interface sends a request to add the borrowing details to the Database. The Database returns an operation status indicating success or failure back to the Borrowing Interface, which then informs the staff member about the outcome. In case the input details are found to be invalid during validation, the Borrowing Interface directly notifies the staff member of the error.

Remember, the above PlantUML diagram assumes a simple and straightforward process flow and might need adjustments and enhancements to match the specific requirements and intricacies of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) as described in your project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story can be a bit complex without specifics on the actual implementation and interfaces. However, I can provide a general sequence diagram in PlantUML format that conceptualizes how a Developer might use a data package as a node library within their project.

This example assumes the Developer has already identified a data package from the platform they intend to use, and the platform offers a CLI tool that facilitates the integration of data packages into development projects.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer as dev
participant "CLI Tool" as cli
participant "Data Registry Platform" as platform
participant "Node Package Manager (npm)" as npm
participant "Developer's Project" as project

dev -> cli : Search for data package
cli -> platform : Query package metadata
platform --> cli : Return metadata
cli --> dev : Display metadata and instructions
dev -> npm : Install data package via npm\n(e.g., npm install <package-name>)
npm -> platform : Request package data
platform --> npm : Transmit package data
npm --> project : Install package dependencies\nand integrate data
project --> dev : Confirm package integration
@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the Developer searching for a data in the CLI tool provided by the Data Registry and Publishing Platform. The interaction includes querying the platform for the data package metadata, showing the Developer this metadata and giving instructions on how to install the package using npm. The Developer proceeds to install the package through npm, which involves npm requesting the actual package data from the platform, installing any dependencies, and completing the package integration into the Developer's project.

Note that this is a general representation. Actual implementations might involve more or fewer steps depending on the specific functionalities of the Platform's API, the CLI tool capabilities, and how the data packages are designed to be used as node libraries (e.g., the need for additional configuration files, environment variables, or post-install scripts).

Bear in mind, this diagram is simplified for demonstration purposes. Real-world processes could involve additional steps such as authentication, handling of errors, and more nuanced handling of dependencies within the npm ecosystem.

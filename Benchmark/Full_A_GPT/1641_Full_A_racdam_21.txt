Given the user story and project description, below is a high-level PlantUML code to create a sequence diagram that outlines the process an archivist follows to distinguish between digital objects digitized to preservation standards and those created for access purposes only. This involves the archivist interacting with a Digital Archive Management System to categorize and apply appropriate preservation actions.

Please note, this PlantUML code assumes a basic flow and utilizes a simplified approach to focus on the main actions relevant to the user story. Adjustments may be necessary to match specific implementation details or to add complexity.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as DAMS
participant "Database" as db

== Identify Digitization Standards ==
archivist -> DAMS : Upload digital object
activate DAMS

DAMS -> DAMS : Evaluate digitization quality
note right of DAMS : Algorithms assess if digitization \nmeets preservation standards

DAMS -> db : Retrieve digitization standards
activate db
db --> DAMS : Digitization standards data
deactivate db

DAMS --> archivist : Display digitization standards met
deactivate DAMS

== Categorize Digital Object ==
archivist -> DAMS : Categorize digital object
activate DAMS

alt If Preservation Standards Met
    DAMS -> db : Mark as "Preservation"
    activate db
    db --> DAMS : Confirmation
    deactivate db
    DAMS --> archivist : Digital object marked for preservation
else If Only for Access
    DAMS -> db : Mark as "Access Only"
    activate db
    db --> DAMS : Confirmation
    deactivate db
    DAMS --> archivist : Digital object marked for access only
end

deactivate DAMS

This sequence diagram begins with the archivist uploading the digital object to the Digital Archive Management System (DAMS). The DAMS then evaluates the digitization quality to determine if the digital object meets the preservation standards using predefined criteria (this could involve algorithms that assess resolution, file format, etc.). After evaluating, the DAMS interacts with the database to mark the digital object either for "Preservation" if it meets the required standards or "Access Only" if it does not. This decision is then communicated back to the archivist.

Keep in mind that this outline is simplified. Real-world applications might involve additional steps, such as error handling, more complex decision trees, and further interactions with other systems or databases for comprehensive metadata management and user access rights settings.

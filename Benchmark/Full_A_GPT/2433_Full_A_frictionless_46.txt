To create a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story using PlantUML, we need to identify the key actors and processes involved in the scenario where a publisher updates their data and verifies its integrity. For the sake of this example, let’s assume a simplified workflow that includes the publisher, DPIE system, and various validation services.

In the scenario, the "publisher" updates data which then goes through a series of checks and validations inside the DPIE system before confirming the data's integrity and storing it. Let's illustrate this in PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "DPIE System" as DPIE
participant "Validation Service" as Validation
participant "Data Storage" as Storage

activate Publisher
Publisher -> DPIE : Update data package
activate DPIE
DPIE -> Validation : Validate updated data
activate Validation
Validation -> Validation : Check data integrity
Validation -> Validation : Ensure conformity to Data Package profiles
Validation --> DPIE : Validation result
deactivate Validation

alt if data is good
    DPIE -> Storage : Store updated data package
    activate Storage
    Storage --> DPIE : Confirm data stored
    deactivate Storage
    DPIE --> Publisher : Update and validation successful
else if data has errors
    DPIE --> Publisher : Update failed - errors found
end

deactivate DPIE
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the "Publisher" updating the data package, which then gets processed by the "DPIE System". The DPIE System sends the data for validation to the "Validation Service", which performs integrity checks and ensures the data conforms to the specified Data Package profiles. Based on the outcome of these validations, two paths are possible:

1. **If the data is good:** The Validation Service confirms the data’s integrity back to the DPIE System, which then proceeds to store the updated data package in "Data Storage". Following successful storage, the DPIE System notifies the Publisher about the successful update and validation.

2. **If there are errors in the data:** The Validation Service finds issues with the data and reports back to the DPIE system, which then informs the Publisher that the update has failed due to the detected errors.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the process involved in updating and validating data packages through the DPIE system from the perspective of a publisher.

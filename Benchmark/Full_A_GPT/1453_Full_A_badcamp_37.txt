Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a sponsor, I want to sponsor a summit that matches my brand, so that I can get exposure to potential customers and otherwise tout my Drupal credentials." involves depicting the interactions between the Sponsor (Actor) and the system (BADCamp Enhancement Platform) including relevant subsystems such as User Authentication, Sponsorship Management, Payment Processing, and Summit Coordination. Below is a representation of this process in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Sponsor as S
participant "Authentication System" as AS
participant "Sponsorship Management\nSystem" as SMS
participant "Payment System" as PS
participant "Summit Coordination\nSystem" as SCS

S -> AS : Enter credentials
AS --> S : Authentication Successful

S -> SMS : Request available summits
SMS -> SCS : Fetch Summits matching brand criteria
SCS --> SMS : Summit details
SMS --> S : List of Summits

S -> SMS : Select Summit to sponsor
SMS -> S : Display sponsorship levels & benefits

S -> SMS : Choose sponsorship level
SMS --> S : Sponsorship details & Payment information form

S -> PS : Submit Payment information
PS -> PS : Process Payment
PS --> S : Payment Confirmation

PS -> SMS : Notify Payment Success
SMS -> SCS : Assign Sponsor to Summit
SCS --> SMS : Confirmation

SMS --> S : Sponsorship Confirmation & Receipt
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Sponsor authenticating themselves on the BADCamp Enhancement Platform. After successful login, the Sponsor requests a list of available summits that match their branding criteria. The Sponsorship Management System consults the Summit Coordination System for details and presents the options to the Sponsor. 

Upon selecting a summit to sponsor, the Sponsor is shown various sponsorship levels and their benefits, from which they make a selection. They are then prompted to enter their payment information, which is processed by the Payment System. 

Upon successful payment, the Payment System notifies the Sponsorship Management System, which, in turn, assigns the Sponsor to the selected summit and confirms the sponsorship. Finally, the Sponsor receives a confirmation of their sponsorship and a receipt, completing the process. 

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions involved in sponsoring a summit through the BADCamp Enhancement Platform, as requested.

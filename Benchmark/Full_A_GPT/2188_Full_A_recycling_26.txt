Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format involves outlining the interactions between different system components, as triggered by an HR department employee's request to access full employee information. This scenario implies a need to authenticate the HR user, retrieve employee information from the database, and present it in a secure manner.

Due to the nature of the text-based explanation, the exact visual representation of the sequence diagram is not possible here, but I will provide you with a PlantUML code snippet that describes the process.

Please note, specific implementation details such as authentication mechanisms or data storage solutions (e.g., database types) might vary based on the actual system architecture and are simplified here for demonstration purposes.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor HRUser as "HR Employee"
participant WebInterface as "RecycleSmart Web Interface"
participant AuthenticationServer as "Auth Server"
participant Database as "Employee Database"
participant AdminInterface as "HR Admin Interface"

== Authentication ==
HRUser -> WebInterface : Access HR/Admin Section
WebInterface -> AuthenticationServer : Validate HR Credentials
AuthenticationServer --> WebInterface : Credentials Validated
WebInterface --> HRUser : Access Granted

== Retrieve Employee Information ==
HRUser -> AdminInterface : Request Full Employee Information
AdminInterface -> Database : Query All Employee Data
Database --> AdminInterface : Return Employee Data
AdminInterface --> HRUser : Display Employee Information

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified interaction-flow for an HR department employee gaining access to the full information of all employees working for the business. Key steps include:
1. **Authentication**: The HR Employee accesses the RecycleSmart Web Interface and is authenticated.
2. **Retrieve Employee Information**: Upon successful authentication, the HR Employee requests full employee information through the HR/Admin section of the interface. The system queries the database and returns the requested information, which is then displayed to the HR Employee.

This example assumes that access control and authentication are handled externally (e.g., via an Authentication Server) and emphasizes the process flow from the perspective of an employee in the HR department interacting with the system. To implement this in a real environment, further details about the database schema, authentication methods, and specific security measures (such as TLS/SSL for data transmission) should be considered.

Generating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story in PlantUML format will involve illustrating the steps that the UnivIT service team must undertake to integrate the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform with existing university systems, like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), for user authentication and management. Let's break down the process into PlantUML code to visualize this integration:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant WebInterface as WI
participant APIGateway as API
participant AuthenticationModule as AM
participant LDAPSystem as LDAP

U -> WI: Requests login
activate WI
WI -> API: Forwards login request
activate API
API -> AM: Requests user authentication
activate AM
AM -> LDAP: Queries user credentials
activate LDAP
LDAP --> AM: Returns authentication result
deactivate LDAP
AM --> API: Confirms user identity
deactivate AM
API --> WI: Authentication successful
deactivate API
WI --> U: Grants access to platform
deactivate WI

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the process begins with the user requesting to log in to the web interface of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. The web interface forwards this request to an API gateway, which then consults the Authentication Module to authenticate the user. The Authentication Module queries the LDAP system with the user's credentials. LDAP responds with the authentication result. If successful, the user is granted access to the platform. This sequence ensures that the process of user authentication is efficiently managed through the integration of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform with existing LDAP systems, keeping administration costs low.

This PlantUML code provides a structured overview of the interactions involved in integrating LDAP for user authentication in the context of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. Keep in mind, additional steps or systems might be involved depending on the specific requirements and existing infrastructure at the University of Bath.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to delete a book recommendation" using PlantUML, you would need to consider the various components and actors involved in this process. The following is an example of how you might model this interaction:

```
@startuml
actor Customer as cust
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Recommendation Controller" as recCtrl
database "Database" as db

cust -> web : Choose to delete recommendation
activate web

web -> recCtrl : Request to delete recommendation(ID)
activate recCtrl

recCtrl -> db : Query to check recommendation exists
activate db

db --> recCtrl : Recommendation details
deactivate db

recCtrl -> db : Delete recommendation by ID
activate db

db --> recCtrl : Confirmation of deletion
deactivate db

recCtrl --> web : Show success message
deactivate recCtrl

web --> cust : Display deletion success message
deactivate web

@enduml
```

Explanation:

1. **Customer (Actor):** Initiates the process by choosing to delete a book recommendation through the web interface.
   
2. **Web Interface (Participant):** Acts as the intermediary between the customer and the recommendation controller, receiving the customer's request.

3. **Recommendation Controller (Participant):** Handles the logic for deleting a recommendation. It first checks to see if the recommendation exists in the database.

4. **Database (Participant):** Stores all the data related to recommendations. It is queried to find and then delete the specified recommendation.

The sequence starts with the customer opting to delete a recommendation and ends with the customer being shown a success message after the recommendation has been successfully deleted from the database.

This diagram outlines the main steps and the flow of information between different system components for the process of deleting a book recommendation. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific architecture and requirements of your Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

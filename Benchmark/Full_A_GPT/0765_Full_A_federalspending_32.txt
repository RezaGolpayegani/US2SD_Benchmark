Given your request, below is a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML code format for the specific User Story: "As an agency user, I want to ensure that deleted FS most. The following diagram outlines the sequence of interactions between different system components and stakeholders to fulfill this requirement.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AgencyUser as AU
participant BrokerWebInterface as BWI
participant DataValidationService as DVS
participant Database as DB

AU -> BWI : Initiate Submission Request
BWI -> DVS : Start Data Processing
DVS -> DB : Fetch Data Including FSRS Records
DB --> DVS : Data with FSRS Records
DVS -> DVS : Validate FSRS Record Status
DVS -> DB : Query for Deleted FSRS Records
DB --> DVS : Deleted FSRS Records List
DVS -> DVS : Exclude Deleted FSRS Records from Submission
DVS -> BWI : Return Processed and Validated Data for Submission
BWI -> AU : Display Submission Results\n(without Deleted FSRS Records)
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Agency User Initiates Submission Request**: The process begins with the agency user initiating a data submission request through the Broker Web Interface (BWI).

2. **Start Data Processing**: The Broker Web Interface requests the Data Validation Service to start processing the data.

3. **Fetch Data Including FSRS Records**: The Data Validation Service fetches the necessary data from the Database, including FSRS records that are part of the submission.

4. **Validate FSRS Record Status**: The Data Validation Service checks the status of FSRS records to identify any that have been deleted.

5. **Query for Deleted FSRS Records**: The Data Validation Service queries the Database specifically for a list of FSRS records that have been flagged as deleted.

6. **Exclude Deleted FSRS Records from Submission**: With the list of deleted FSRS records, the Data Validation Service excludes these from the submission data, ensuring they are not part of the final submission packet.

7. **Return Processed and Validated Data for Submission**: The processed and validated submission data, now excluding any deleted FSRS records, is sent back to the Broker Web Interface.

8. **Display Submission Results to Agency User**: Finally, the Broker Web Interface displays the results of the submission to the agency user, confirming that deleted FSRS records were not included.

This sequence ensures that agency users can confidently submit their data, knowing that any FSRS records that have been deleted will not be mistakenly included in their submissions.

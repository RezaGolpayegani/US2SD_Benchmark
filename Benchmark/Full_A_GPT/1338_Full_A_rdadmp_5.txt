Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involving a repository owner using the DMPTool involves several actors and components. Below is a PlantUML representation that encapsulates the process of checking data provenance and calculating submission fees.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor RepositoryOwner as "Repository Owner"
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "DMP Database" as DMPDB
participant "Provenance Checker" as Provenance
participant "Fee Calculator" as Calculator

== Checking Planned Provenance & Calculating Submission Fees ==

RepositoryOwner -> Interface : Accesses DMPTool
Interface -> DMPDB : Retrieve project DMP
DMPDB --> Interface : Return DMP data
Interface --> RepositoryOwner : Show DMP data including provenance

RepositoryOwner -> Interface : Request provenance check
Interface -> Provenance : Validate provenance data
Provenance -> DMPDB : Access relevant metadata
DMPDB --> Provenance : Provide metadata
Provenance --> Interface : Return check results

alt Provenance is Valid
  Provenance --> RepositoryOwner : Confirm data is within target group
  RepositoryOwner -> Interface : Request submission fee calculation
  Interface -> Calculator : Calculate fees based on DMP data
  Calculator -> DMPDB : Retrieve additional data if needed
  DMPDB --> Calculator : Provide data
  Calculator --> Interface : Return calculated fees
  Interface --> RepositoryOwner : Display submission fees
else Provenance is Invalid
  Provenance --> RepositoryOwner : Data not within target group
end

This sequence diagram starts with the Repository Owner accessing the DMPTool Interface to review a project's Data Management Plan (DMP). The Interface retrieves the DMP from the DMP Database. The Repository Owner can check the planned provenance of the data from the DMP data displayed. If the owner decides to validate the provenance, the Interface communicates with a Provenance Checker component, which validates the data against relevant metadata in the DMP Database and returns the results. If the provenance is confirmed, the Repository Owner may request a calculation of the necessary submission fees. The Interface communicates with a Fee Calculator component, which calculates the fees based on the DMP data and possibly additional data retrieved from the DMP Database, and then displays the fees to the Repository Owner.

This representation is simplified to focus on the specific user story and may not cover all possible intricacies and error handling present in a real-world application.

Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for the user story of a customer wanting to reserve a book in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) involves illustrating the interactions between the system components involved in the reservation process. Here is how you could structure the PlantUML code to represent these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Customer
participant "CLMS Web Interface" as Web
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> Web : Request to reserve a book
Web -> Reservation : Validate request
activate Reservation

Reservation -> DB : Check book availability
activate DB
DB --> Reservation : Book availability status
deactivate DB

alt If book is available
    Reservation --> Web : Show book available
    Web --> Customer : Display success message

    Customer -> Web : Confirm reservation
    Web -> Reservation : Process reservation
    activate Reservation

    Reservation -> DB : Update book status to reserved
    activate DB
    DB --> Reservation : Confirmation of reservation
    deactivate DB
    
    Reservation --> Web : Reservation success
    Web --> Customer : Display reservation details
else If book is unavailable
    Reservation --> Web : Show book unavailable
    Web --> Customer : Display waitlist option

    Customer -> Web : Request to be added to waitlist
    Web -> Reservation : Process waitlist request
    Reservation -> DB : Add to waitlist
    DB --> Reservation : Waitlist confirmation
    deactivate DB

    Reservation --> Web : Waitlist success
    Web --> Share : Display waitlist confirmation
endif

deactivate Reservation
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Customer interacting with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) Web Interface to reserve a book. The sequence includes checking the book's availability in the database and either proceeding with the reservation if the book is available or offering a waitlist option if it is not. In either case, the process involves interaction with the database to update the book's status or add the customer to the waitlist, and concludes with the system providing feedback to the customer.

This representation is a simplified view meant to illustrate the fundamental interactions for reserving a book. Real-world implementations might include additional steps or complexity, such as handling payment for reservations if applicable, more detailed interactions for error handling, or interactions with external systems for notifications.

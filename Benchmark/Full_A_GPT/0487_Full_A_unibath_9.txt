Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story provided involves mapping out the interactions between the depositor, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, and any underlying services or systems involved in the process of depositing arbitrarily large files. This diagram will depict the flow from the user initiating a file deposit to the successful storage of the file. Given the complexity and various components involved in such a platform, we'll focus on key interactions to keep the sequence clear and understandable.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor as depositor
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Deposit API" as api
participant "File Splitter" as splitter
participant "Storage Service" as storage
participant "Metadata Service" as metadata
participant "DOI Service" as doi

depositor -> web : Selects file for deposit
web -> api : Initiate deposit request
note right of api : Validates file size\nand user permissions
api -> splitter : Send large file
splitter -> splitter : Split file into chunks
loop For each chunk
    splitter -> storage : Upload chunk
end
storage -> api : Confirm all chunks uploaded
api -> metadata : Generate metadata for file
metadata -> api : Return metadata ID
api -> doi : Request DOI for file
doi -> api : Return DOI
api -> web : Return deposit success\nwith metadata and DOI
web -> depositor : Display success message\nand deposit details

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Depositor Interaction**: The depositor starts by selecting the file they wish to deposit through a simplified data deposit interface (the "Web Interface").

2. **Initiate Deposit Request**: The web interface communicates with the Deposit API to start the file deposit process. The API performs initial validations, including file size checks and user permissions.

3. **File Splitting**: Due to the file being arbitrarily large, the API forwards the file to a "File Splitter" service, which is responsible for splitting the large file into manageable chunks. This is essential for efficient upload and storage.

4. **Uploading Chunks**: Each chunk of the split file is then uploaded to the "Storage Service." This process continues in a loop until all chunks are uploaded.

5. **Upload Confirmation**: Once all chunks are successfully uploaded, the Storage Service notifies the API of the successful upload.

6. **Metadata Generation**: The API then requests the generation of metadata for the deposited file from the "Metadata Service." This metadata enhances the file's discoverability and reuse.

7. **DOI Minting**: Concurrently, the API makes a request to the "DOI Service" to mint a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for the file, which is crucial for citation and linking to publications.

8. **Deposit Success**: Finally, the API aggregates the successful deposit confirmation, metadata ID, and DOI, returning this information to the web interface.

9. **User Notification**: The depositor is then notified through the web interface of the successful deposit, along with the details of the deposit such as the metadata ID and DOI for the file.

This sequence diagram reflects a high-level view of the interactions and does not delve into error handling, authentication, and other system-specific concerns that would also be fundamental parts of an actual implementation.

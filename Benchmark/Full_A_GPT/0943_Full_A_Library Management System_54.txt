Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a librarian, I want to edit the list of borrowed books." in PlantUML format involves outlining the interaction between different system components and the user actions. Given the complexity of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) as described, several objects and actors would likely be involved in this process, including the Librarian (User), Frontend Interface, Authentication Service, Book Management Service, and Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant "Frontend Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Book Management Service" as BMS
database "Database" as DB

L -> UI: Selects 'Edit Borrowed Books'
UI -> Auth: Authenticate Librarian
Auth -> UI: Authentication Success
UI -> UI: Display Borrowed Books List
L -> UI: Chooses a book to edit
UI -> BMS: Request Edit Book [Book ID]
alt Book Found in Borrowed List
    BMS -> DB: Fetch Borrowed Book Details [Book ID]
    DB -> BMS: Book Details
    BMS -> UI: Display Book Details
    L -> UI: Edits Book Details (Return date, borrower, etc.)
    UI -> BMS: Update Book Details [Book ID]
    BMS -> DB: Update Book in Database
    DB -> BMS: Confirmation of Update
    BMS -> UI: Update Success Message
    UI -> L: Display Success Message
else Book Not Found
    BMS -> UI: Error Message - Book Not Found
    UI -> L: Display Error Message
end

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified flow of a librarian wanting to edit the list of borrowed books within the CLMS. It includes key steps from authentication to database updates. Depending on the exact requirements and system design some elements might change:

1. **Authentication:** Assuming the librarian must be authenticated to perform the edit operation, the sequence starts with this step.
2. **Frontend Interaction:** The librarian interacts with the system through a frontend interface, starting the process by selecting an option to edit borrowed books.
3. **Book Selection & Details Fetching:** The librarian chooses a book to edit from the list, and the system fetches and displays the details for that book from the database.
4. **Editing Process:** The librarian makes changes to the book's details, such as updating return dates or borrower information, and submits the changes.
5. **Database Update:** The Book Management Service updates the book's information in the database and confirms the success of the update to the librarian.

Please note, for a real-world application, additional steps and considerations might be required such as error handling for database operations, concurrent edits, or validation of edit permissions based on user roles, which aren't detailed in this simplified example.

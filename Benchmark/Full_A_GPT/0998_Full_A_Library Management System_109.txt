Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to view the due dates of borrowed books so that I can inform members" involves representing the interaction between different components (like the librarian, the library management system, and the database) to accomplish this task. Understanding that PlantUML is a tool that allows you to visually represent diagrams using plain text descriptions, here is how your sequence diagram could be scripted:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as system
database "Library Database" as db

librarian -> system : Request borrowed books' due dates
activate system

system -> db : Retrieve due dates for all borrowed books
activate db
db -> system : Return due dates
deactivate db

system -> librarian : Display due dates
deactivate system

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram script does the following:

1. **Starts** with the librarian requesting the due dates of borrowed books from the library management system.
2. The library management system **interacts** with the library database to retrieve the due dates for all borrowed books.
3. The database **returns** the due dates to the library management system.
4. Finally, the library management system **displays** these due dates to the librarian.

In this diagram, the interaction is straightforward and focuses on the librarian's need to access book due dates to inform library members potentially. The actual implementation can have more steps and might involve checking user permissions, filtering data based on specific criteria (like books borrowed by a particular member or books that are overdue), and formatting the output data for easy readability.

To visualize this diagram, make sure you have PlantUML setup or use an online PlantUML editor by copying the script into the editor.

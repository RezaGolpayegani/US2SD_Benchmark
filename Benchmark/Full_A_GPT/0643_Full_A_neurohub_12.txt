Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a researcher, I want to upload files prior to having them attached to a log book page using the web interface" involves illustrating the interactions between the researcher (user), the web interface, and the backend systems, including data storage and management services. 

While PlantUML code can't be executed here directly, I can provide you with an outline and the corresponding PlantUML code that you can run in a PlantUML environment or editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Researcher as R
participant "Web Interface" as WI
participant "Backend System" as BS
participant "Data Storage" as DS

R->WI: Accesses Neurohub web interface
activate WI

WI->WI: Authenticate researcher
note right of WI: Authentication process involved

WI->BS: Request upload form
activate BS
BS->WI: Provide upload form
deactivate BS

R->WI: Submits files for upload
WI->BS: Initiate file upload
activate BS

BS->DS: Store files temporarily
activate DS
DS->BS: Confirm files stored
deactivate DS

BS->WI: Generate upload confirmation
deactivate BS
WI->R: Display confirmation message
deactivate WI

R->WI: Requests to attach files to a logbook page
activate WI
WI->BS: Request file attachment process
activate BS
BS->DS: Attach files to logbook page
activate DS
DS->DS: Update metadata with logbook reference
DS->BS: Confirm attachment successful
deactivate DS

BS->WI: Confirm attachment to R
deactivate BS
WI->R: Show success message
deactivate WI

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the Researcher accessing the Neurohub web interface and proceeds through the steps of authenticating, requesting an upload form, submitting files, storing these files temporarily in the Data Storage, and finally attaching these files to a specified logbook page with a confirmation of successful attachment displayed to the researcher.

Please ensure you have a PlantUML environment or use an online PlantUML editor to visualize this diagram. The diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions that fulfill the user story of uploading and attaching files to a logbook page via the web interface.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that captures the interaction flow for the given user story requires identifying the actors, components, and interactions involved in notifying a researcher when only part of a folder has been digitized. Below is a simplified version of how these elements could be structured in a sequence diagram for this scenario. This example assumes the existence of a Digital Archive Management System (DAMS) with components like a User Interface (UI), Backend Server, Database, and potentially a Notification System.

Please note, this is a textual representation of a PlantUML script. To visualize it, you would need to use a PlantUML processor or compatible tool.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Researcher as researcher
participant "UI: Digital Archives Portal" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db
participant "Notification System" as notify

researcher -> UI : Search for items in folder
UI -> server : Query request for folder items
server -> db : Check digitized status of items
db --> server : Return statuses
server -> server : Determine partial digitization
alt if folder is partially digitized
    server -> notify : Initiate notification
    notify -> UI : Show notification
    UI --> researcher : Display "Partially Digitized" alert
else all items digitized
    UI --> researcher : Display full contents
end

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the workflow starts with a `Researcher` searching for items within a folder through the `UI: Digital Archives Portal`. The query is sent to the `Backend Server`, which then checks the digitization status of each item in the folder by querying the `Database`. The `Database` returns the statuses to the `Backend Server`, which determines whether the folder is partially digitized. If it is, the `Backend Server` uses a `Notification System` to initiate a notification, which is then shown to the researcher through the UI indicating that only part of the folder has been digitized. If all items are found to be digitized, the researcher sees the full contents without a partial digitization alert.

This diagram is quite generalized and might lack specifics about the technology stack or detailed interactions within the digital archive's infrastructure. Depending on the complexity of your system and the level of detail required, enhancements might include error handling, authentication checks, or interactions with additional systems like a content delivery network (CDN) for the digitized files.

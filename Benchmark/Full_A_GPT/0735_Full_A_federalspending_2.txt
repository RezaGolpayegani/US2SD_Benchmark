To fulfill your request for generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story, we will break down the tasks involved in redesigning the Resources page as per the new Broker design styles from the perspective of the UI Designer. Note that PlantUML syntax is used to illustrate interactions between the UI Designer, a Design System, Feedback from Stakeholders, and the Development Team. Below is a basic representation to get you started.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor UI_Designer as "UI Designer"
participant Design_System as "Design System"
participant Stakeholder_Feedback as "Stakeholder Feedback"
participant Development_Team as "Development Team"

== Initialization ==
UI_Designer -> Design_System : Access design tokens and guidelines
activate UI_Designer

== Design Phase ==
UI_Designer -> UI_Designer : Create initial design mockups for Resources page
UI_Designer -> Stakeholder_Feedback : Share mockups for feedback
activate Stakeholder_Feedback
Stakeholder_Feedback -> UI_Designer : Provide feedback and revisions
deactivate Stakeholder_Feedback

loop Revision Cycle
    UI_Designer -> UI_Designer : Refine design based on feedback
    UI_Designer -> Stakeholder_Feedback : Share revised mockups
    activate Stakeholder_Feedback
    Stakeholder_Feedback -> UI_Designer : Provide additional feedback
    deactivate Stakeholder_Feedback
end

== Approval ==
UI_Designer -> Stakeholder_Feedback : Finalize design for approval
activate Stakeholder_Feedback
Stakeholder_Feedback -> UI_Designer : Approve final design
deactivate Stakeholder_Feedback

== Development Handoff ==
UI_Designer -> Development_Team : Provide final designs and specifications
activate Development_Team
Development_Team -> Development_Team : Implement design changes
Development_Team -> Development_Team : Perform internal testing
Development_Team -> UI_Designer : Deliver implementation for review
UI_Designer -> UI_Designer : Review implementation
UI_Designer -> Development_Team : Approve implementation or request changes

deactivate Development_Team
deactivate UI_Designer

This diagram starts with the UI Designer accessing the design system, then moving through the design phase that includes multiple rounds of feedback and revisions with stakeholders. Once the final design is approved, it moves into the development handoff, culminating in the implementation review and possible approval. 

Remember, the complexity and level of detail in the actual implementation may require adjustments. This diagram serves as a starting point and can be further expanded based on specific project requirements or milestones.

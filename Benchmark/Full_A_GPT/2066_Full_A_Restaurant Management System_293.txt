Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that illustrates the sequence of interactions between the waiter, the system backend, the kitchen (which includes chefs and cooks), and possibly a notification service, for the user story: "As a waiter, I want to get notifications when an ordered item is ready."

This example assumes a few components and interfaces for interactions:

- `WaiterApp`: The application/interface used by the waiter.
- `BackendAPI`: The backend application programming interface (API) that processes requests and integrates different parts of the system.
- `KitchenManagementSystem`: A system used by chefs and cooks to manage orders and indicate when an order or an item is ready.
- `NotificationService`: A service/component responsible for sending notifications (could be part of `BackendAPI` or an external service).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant WaiterApp
participant BackendAPI
participant KitchenManagementSystem
participant NotificationService

WaiterApp -> BackendAPI : SubmitOrder(orderDetails)
activate WaiterApp
activate BackendAPI
BackendAPI -> KitchenManagementPanel : CreateOrder(orderDetails)
activate KitchenManagementSystem

note over KitchenManagementSystem : Chef/cook marks item as ready

KitchenManagementSystem -> BackendAPI : UpdateOrderStatus(orderId, itemReady)
deactivate KitchenManagementSystem
BackendAPI -> NotificationService : SendNotification(waiterId, message)
activate NotificationService
NotificationService -> WaiterApp : DisplayNotification(message)
deactivate BackendAPI
deactivate NotificationAggregator
WaiterApp --> WaiterApp : AcknowledgeNotification()
deactivate WaiterApp

```

This diagram shows the flow starting with the waiter submitting an order through the `WaiterApp`. The order details are sent to the `BackendAPI`, which then creates an order in the `KitchenManagementSystem` used by chefs and cooks. When a chef or cook marks an item as ready within the `KitchenManagementSystem`, it updates the order status, which triggers a message to the `BackendAPI`. The `BackendAPI` then instructs the `NotificationService` to send a notification to the waiter. Finally, the waiter receives and acknowledges the notification via the `WaiterApp`.

Remember, this is a simplified view and real-world applications might involve more complex steps including error handling, security checks, and multiple intermediary steps to support scalability and reliability.

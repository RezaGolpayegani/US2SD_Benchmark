Given the complexity and multifaceted nature of the restaurant management and operations system described, a sequence diagram to represent the process of a manager wanting to see comments about dishes would involve multiple system components and actors. Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML code that illustrates this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as backend
database "Database" as database

manager -> UI : Open Dish Feedback Section
UI -> backend : Request: Get Comments on Dishes
backend -> database : Query: Fetch Comments Data
database --> backend : Response: Comments Data
backend --> UI : Response: Display Comments
UI --> manager : Show Comments on UI Dashboard

@enduml
```
### Explanation:
1. **Manager (Actor)**: This is the user initiating the process, wanting to view comments about dishes.
2. **UI Dashboard (Participant)**: Acts as the interface through which the manager interacts with the system. The manager opens the 'Dish Feedback Section' to initiate the process.
3. **Backend Service (Participant)**: This component handles the logic upon receiving a request from the UI. It processes this request by interacting with the database to fetch the necessary data.
4. **Database (Participant)**: This is where all comments data related to dishes are stored. Upon request from the backend service, it retrieves and sends back the requested comments data.

This diagram assumes a basic flow where the manager requests to see comments, the system fetches the data, and then displays it back to the manager. In real-world applications, additional complexities, such as error handling, data formatting, and user authentication, might be involved but are omitted here for clarity.

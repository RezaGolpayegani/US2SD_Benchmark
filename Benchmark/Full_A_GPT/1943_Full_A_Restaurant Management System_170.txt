To reflect the described user story in a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax, consider the following scenario: The manager logs into the Restaurant Management and Operations System, navigates to the reports section, selects the option to view item order history, and finally views the generated graph displaying the historical trends of items ordered.

Below is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML to model this flow:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Manager as mgr
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Database" as db

mgr -> web : Log in
activate web

web -> backend : Authenticate Manager
activate backend

backend -> db : Fetch Manager Credentials
activate db

db --> backend : Return Credentials
deactivate db

backend --> web : Authentication Success
deactivate backend

mgr -> web : Select Reports
mgr -> web : Choose Item Order History

web -> backend : Request Item Order Trends
activate backend

backend -> db : Query Ordered Items History
activate db

db --> backend : Return Items History Data
deactivate db

backend --> web : Generate Trends Graph
deactivate backend

web --> mgr : Display Trends Graph
deactivate web

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the basic flow from the manager's action to log in to the system until the item order history graph is displayed. It shows interactions among the manager (user), the web interface, the backend system, and the database. 

In practice, real-world scenarios might include more complex steps, such as error handling, data processing, and security checks, which are simplified here for clarity.

To fulfill the request of creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story you mentioned, we will outline the interactions required between the UnivIT service and the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, including the process of exporting data to a different system. This involves multiple actors and components: the UnivIT service user, the Export Service Interface, the Database (DB), and the Target System. 

Below is a simple representation in PlantUML format of how this process could be visualized:

```
@startuml

actor UnivITServiceUser as "UnivIT Service User"
participant ExportServiceInterface as "Export Service\nInterface"
database DB as "Platform Database"
participant TargetSystem as "Target System"

== Export Data to Another System ==

UnivITServiceUser -> ExportServiceInterface : Request data export
activate ExportServiceInterface

ExportServiceInterface -> DB : Retrieve all data
activate DB
DB --> ExportServiceInterface : Data
deactivate DB

ExportServiceInterface -> ExportServiceInterface : Process and convert data\nfor Target System

ExportServiceInterface -> TargetSystem : Transfer data
activate TargetSystem
TargetSystem --> ExportServiceInterface : Acknowledge receipt
deactivate TargetSystem

ExportServiceInterface --> UnivITServiceUser : Confirm export completion
deactivate ExportServiceInterface

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. **UnivIT Service User** initiates the process by requesting a data export through the **Export Service Interface**.
2. The **Export Service Interface** sends a request to the **Platform Database** to retrieve all the relevant data.
3. The **Platform Database** returns the requested data to the **Export Service Interface**.
4. The **Export Service Interface** processes and converts the data into a format that is compatible with the **Target System**.
5. The **Export Service Interface** then transfers the data to the **Target System**.
6. Upon successful transfer, the **Target System** sends an acknowledgment back to the **Export Service Interface**.
7. Finally, the **Export Service Interface** informs the **UnivIT Service User** that the export has been completed successfully.

This sequence diagram assumes a straightforward interaction without considering error handling or security protocols, which would be crucial in a real-world scenario. Additionally, specifics such as the data format and the method of transfer to the Target System would need to be defined based on the technical requirements and capabilities of the systems involved.

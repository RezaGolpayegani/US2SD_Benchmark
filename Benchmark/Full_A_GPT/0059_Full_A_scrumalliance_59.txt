Given the requirements in your project description, I'll outline a basic sequence diagram for the described user story using PlantUML syntax. This sequence diagram will cover the interactions needed for a site editor to set the visibility of an article to either "Public" or "Members Only" within the Scrum Alliance Community Platform.

Please note, the detailed implementation may vary depending on your specific technical architecture, but this serves as a general guide.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteEditor as Editor
entity "Content Management System" as CMS
database "Article Database" as DB

== Article Visibility Setting Process ==

Editor -> CMS: Login to CMS
CMS -> Editor: Display Dashboard

Editor -> CMS: Select "Edit Article"
CMS -> DB: Retrieve Article Details
DB -> CMS: Article Details
CMS -> Editor: Show Article Options (including visibility)

Editor -> CMS: Set Visibility to "Public" or "Members Only"
CMS -> DB: Update Article Visibility
DB -> CMS: Confirmation of Update
CMS -> Editor: Show Update Confirmation

Editor -> CMS : Logout
CMS -> Editor: Confirm Logout

### Explanation:
1. **Login to CMS:** The site editor (you) logs into the Content Management System (CMS) to access the dashboard.
2. **Select "Edit Article":** The editor chooses an option to edit an existing article. This action prompts the CMS to retrieve the details of that article from the Article Database.
3. **Show Article Options:** The CMS presents the article details, including current visibility settings and other editable features.
4. **Set Visibility:** The editor updates the article's visibility setting to either "Public" or "Members Only," according to the desired access restriction.
5. **Update Article Visibility:** The updated visibility setting is sent to the database to modify the article's records. The database confirms the successful update.
6. **Show Update Confirmation:** The CMS displays a confirmation to the editor that the article's visibility has been successfully updated.
7. **Logout:** The completion of the task is followed by the editor logging out from the CMS.

This sequence diagram is simplified to focus on the high-level interactions required to achieve the user story's goal. Depending on the platform, additional steps or integrations (like audit logging, user role verification, etc.) might also need to be considered and represented in a more detailed design document.

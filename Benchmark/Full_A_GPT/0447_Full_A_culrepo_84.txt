To represent the user story in a sequence diagram with PlantUML, we need to consider the interactions between the faculty member and the digital repository system along with its components. This sequence would likely involve steps for preparing the upload, performing the upload, processing the large file, making it accessible for download, and ensuring compliance with funder requirements. 

Given the complexity and the multiple systems and actions involved, the diagram will be somewhat simplified.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember
participant "Upload Interface" as UI
participant "Repository System" as RS
participant "File Processing" as FP
participant "Storage" as S
participant "Compliance Checker" as CC
participant "Access Management" as AM
participant "Download Interface" as DI

== Upload Process ==
FacultyMember -> UI : Navigate to upload section
activate UI
UI -> RS : Initiate file upload (>1GB)
activate RS

RS -> FP : Check file size & type
activate FP
alt file size > 1GB
    FP -> FP : Split file into chunks
else smaller file
    FP -> FP : Proceed without splitting
end
FP -> S : Stores file chunks/data
activate S
S --> FP : Confirm storage
deactivate S
FP --> RS : File processing complete
deactivate FP

== Compliance and Access Management ==
RS -> CC : Verify compliance with funder requirements
activate CC
CC --> RS : Compliance confirmed
deactivate CC

RS -> AM : Set access permissions ('Downloadable' by users)
activate AM
AM --> RS : Permissions set
deactivate AM

RS -> UI : Upload success message
deactivate RS
UI --> FacultyMember : Display success & access details
deactivate UI

== Download Process ==
FacultyMember -> FacultyMember : Share download link with intended users

User -> DI : Navigate to shared link
activate DI
DI -> RS : Request to download file (>1GB)
activate RS

RS -> AM : Check access permissions
activate AM
AM --> RS : Permissions validated
deactivate AM

RS -> FP : Prepare file for download
activate FP
FP -> FP : Reassemble file (if split)
FP -> DI : Provide file
deactivate FP

DI -> User : Start file download
deactivate DI

This sequence diagram starts from the faculty member preparing to upload a large file (>1GB) till the point where an intended user starts to download the file. Several steps are simplified or abstracted:

1. **Upload Process:** Includes splitting the large file into manageable chunks if necessary, ensuring the system can handle large uploads effectively.
2. **Compliance and Access Management:** Ensuring the uploaded files meet funder's requirements and setting appropriate permissions for file access.
3. **Download Process:** Reassembling the file if it was split and making it available for the intended users to download.

This diagram assumes a system capable of handling large files through a chunking process, compliance checks, access management, and an efficient method for users to download these files. Adaptations may be necessary depending on specific technical implementations and system capabilities.

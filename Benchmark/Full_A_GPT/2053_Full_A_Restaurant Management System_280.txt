Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to create the reservation for each table" requires illustrating the sequence of interactions between objects in response to an event. In this case, the event is the process of a waiter creating a reservation.

Below is an example of how you could depict this process using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter as waiter
participant "Reservation System" as system
participant Database as db

waiter -> system : Enter reservation details\n(Name, Date, Time, Table #)
system -> db : Check table availability
alt Table is available
  db -> system : Confirm availability
  system -> waiter : Show confirmation message
  waiter -> system : Confirm reservation
  system -> db : Save reservation details
  db -> system : Confirmation of save
  system -> waiter : Display reservation ID and details
else Table not available
  db -> system : Show unavailable message
  system -> waiter : Display alternative options
end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the "Waiter" initiating the reservation process by entering the reservation details into the "Reservation System". The system then checks with the "Database" to see if the requested table is available at the specified time.

- If the table is available, the database confirms this to the reservation system, which then informs the waiter of the availability. The waiter confirms the reservation, and the reservation system proceeds to save the details back in the database. Once the save is confirmed, the reservation system displays the reservation ID and details back to the waiter.

- If the table is not available, the database informs the reservation system, which then communicates this to the waiter. The waiter is then shown alternative options.

This diagram assumes a simplified flow focused on the process from the waiter's perspective, interacting through a centralized reservation system and its interactions with a database backend to manage the availability and details of reservations. In real implementations, additional steps and systems might be involved, such as authentication, error handling, and interaction with external systems for notifications.

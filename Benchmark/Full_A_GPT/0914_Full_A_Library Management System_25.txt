Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story, "As a librarian, I want to arrange book list based on authors," involves illustrating the interactions between the librarian, the front-end interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the backend server, and the database. Below is a simplified sequence diagram written in PlantUML format to represent these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Librarian -> Frontend : Selects "Arrange Books by Author"
Frontend -> Backend : Request to retrieve books sorted by author
Backend -> DB : Query to select books ordered by author
DB -> Backend : Return sorted book list
Backend -> Frontend : Display sorted book list
Frontend -> Librarian : Shows book list arranged by authors

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the librarian selecting the option to arrange books by authors through the frontend interface. The request is then forwarded to the backend server, which queries the database for books ordered by author names. The database responds with the sorted list, which is sent back to the frontend interface for display to the librarian.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and might need refinements based on the specific interactions, technologies, and database structures implemented in the CLMS. Additionally, error handling, security checks (like verifying the librarian's permissions), and more detailed steps might be added for a comprehensive design.

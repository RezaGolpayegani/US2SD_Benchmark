To create a sequence diagram for the described user story "As a Developer, I want to update the Broker validation rule table to account for the rule updates in DB-2213" in PlantUML format, follow the steps outlined below. This diagram will detail the interactions necessary between the Developer and various components of the system to accomplish this task.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Development Environment" as DevEnv
participant "Version Control System" as VCS
participant "Continuous Integration System" as CIS
participant "Broker Validation Rule Table" as BVRT
participant "Broker Database" as BDB

== Update Process ==
Developer -> DevEnv : Retrieve latest codebase
DevEnv -> VCS : Pull request for latest version
VCS -> DevEnv : Return latest codebase

Developer -> DevEnv : Implement rule updates in DB-2213
DevEnv -> Developer : Display implemented changes

Developer -> DevEnv : Write unit tests for DB-2213 changes
DevEnv -> Developer : Run tests and display results

Developer -> DevEnv : Commit changes and tests
DevEnv -> VCS : Push committed changes and tests

== Continuous Integration ==
VCS -> CIS : Trigger build for new commit
CIS -> CIS : Compile code and run all tests
CIS -> VCS : Report build and test status

== Deployment ==
CIS -> BVRT : Update Broker validation rule table with DB-2213 rules
BVRT -> BDB : Apply rule updates in Broker Database
BDB -> BVRT : Confirm updates

CIS -> Developer : Notify deployment success

== Validation ==
Developer -> BVRT : Verify DB-2213 rules in Broker Application
BVRT -> Developer : Display new rule state and validation results

**Explanation:**

1. **Update Process:** The Developer starts by retrieving the latest codebase from the Version Control System (VCS) and implementing the necessary rule updates mentioned in DB-2213 within their development environment. This includes writing and running unit tests to ensure the changes work as expected.

2. **Continuous Integration:** Upon committing the changes, the VCS triggers a build in the Continuous Integration System (CIS), which compiles the code, runs all tests, and reports the status. If everything passes, the process moves forward.

3. **Deployment:** The CIS system, upon a successful build and test phase, updates the Broker Validation Rule Table (BVRT) with the new validation rules from DB-2213. This update is applied to the Broker Database (BDB), which confirms the updates.

4. **Validation:** Finally, the Developer verifies that the DB-2213 rule updates are correctly applied and functioning within the Broker application by checking the rule state and validation results.

This sequence ensures that the Developer's intention to update the Broker validation rule table with specific changes (DB-2213) is achieved effectively, with all the necessary validations and checks in place.

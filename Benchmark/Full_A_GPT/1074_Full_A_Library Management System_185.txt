Creating a sequence diagram for the user story where a library visitor wants to find a book by the name of the writer involves illustrating the interactions between the user, the CLMS web interface, the system's backend, and the database. The following PlantUML code depicts these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Visitor as V
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Backend System" as B
participant "Database" as D

V -> W : Enter writer's name
W -> B : Request books by writer(name)
B -> D : Query books by author(name)
D --> B : Return book results
B --> W : Display books list
W --> V : Show books by writer
@enduml
```

To understand this sequence diagram, let's break down each step represented in the PlantUML code:

1. **Visitor to Web Interface**: The library visitor starts by entering the writer's name into the CLMS web interface. This action initiates the search process.

2. **Web Interface to Backend System**: The web interface forwards the search query, specifically the writer's name, to the backend system. This demonstrates the interaction from the client side to the server side.

3. **Backend System to Database**: The backend system, upon receiving the request, queries the database for books authored by the specified writer. This step shows the interaction between the application's backend logic and the database.

4. **Database to Backend System**: After fetching the results, the database returns the list of books that match the query criteria back to the backend system. This underscores the data retrieval process.

5. **Backend System to Web Interface**: The backend system then sends this list of books back to the web interface. This highlights the server's response to the client-side request.

6. **Web Interface to Visitor**: Finally, the web interface displays the results to the library visitor, completing the search operation.

This PlantUML diagram provides a graphical representation of the interactions involved in finding a book by the writer's name using the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

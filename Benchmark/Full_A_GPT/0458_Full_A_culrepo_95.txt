Below is the PlantUML code that illustrates a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of a library staff member wanting to create custom metadata fields for certain collections and enable searching of those collections by those fields. This sequence diagram outlines the interaction between the library staff member and the system components involved in this process.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Library Staff Member" as staff
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Collection Management Module" as collectionModule
participant "Metadata Configuration" as metadataConfig
participant "Database" as db
participant "Search Engine" as search

== Create Custom Metadata Fields for a Collection ==
staff -> web : Access Collection Settings
web -> collectionModule : Request Collection Configuration
collectionModule -> metadataConfig : Open Metadata Setting
staff -> web : Specify Custom Metadata Fields
web -> metadataConfig : Create Custom Fields
metadataConfig -> db : Update Collection Metadata Schema

== Enable Searching by Custom Metadata Fields ==
metadataConfig -> search : Update Indexing with New Fields
search -> db : Re-index Collections with Custom Fields

== Success Confirmation ==
metadataConfig -> web : Confirm Custom Fields Created
search -> web : Confirm Fields are Searchable
web -> staff : Display Success Message

This diagram represents the following workflow:

1. The **library staff member** accesses the collection settings through the **Web Interface**.
2. The **Web Interface** sends a request to the **Collection Management Module** to open the collection configuration settings.
3. The **Collection Management Module** interacts with the **Metadata Configuration** component to open and modify metadata settings for a specific collection.
4. The **library staff member** specifies the custom metadata fields they wish to create through the **Web Interface**.
5. The **Web Interface** forwards these specifications to the **Metadata Configuration** component.
6. **Metadata Configuration** creates these custom metadata fields and updates the collection's metadata schema in the **Database**.
7. To ensure the collections can be searched by these new custom fields, the **Metadata Configuration** instructs the **Search Engine** to update its indexing to include the new fields.
8. The **Search Engine** conducts a re-index of the collections involving the newly specified custom metadata fields, updating its search capabilities accordingly.
9. Upon successful creation of the custom metadata fields and updating of the search index, the **Metadata Configuration** and **Search Engine** components send confirmation messages back to the **Web Interface**.
10. The **Web Interface** displays a success message to the **library staff member**, indicating that the custom metadata fields have been created and are searchable.

This sequence diagram outlines a straightforward yet comprehensive flow for creating custom metadata fields and making them searchable, meeting the library staff member's needs while ensuring a user-friendly experience.

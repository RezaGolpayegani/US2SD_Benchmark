Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an Archivist, I want to add Notes to other record types" using PlantUML language involves defining the actors, boundaries (such as the system and database), and the steps involved in this process. Here's a basic illustration of how this might look in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
boundary System
database CAMSDB as "CAMS Database"

activate Archivist
Archivist -> System : Request to add notes to a record
activate System
System -> CAMSDB : Fetch record details
activate CAMSDB
CAMSDB --> System : Record details
deactivate CAMSDB
System --> Archivist : Display record details
Archivist -> System : Input note details (content, type, etc.)
System -> CAMSDB : Store new note
activate CAMSDB
CAMSDB --> System : Confirmation of note addition
deactivate CAMSDB
System --> Archivist : Confirm note addition
deactivate System
deactivate Archivist

### Explanation
1. **Archivist**: This represents the user of the system, in this scenario, the archivist who wants to add notes to a record.
2. **System**: This boundary object represents the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS) interface with which the Archivist interacts.
3. **CAMS Database (CAMSDB)**: This database stores all the information, including records and notes information that the Archivist wishes to modify or add to.

#### Flow of Events:
- The **Archivist** initiates the process by requesting to add notes to a specific record.
- The **System** retrieves the details of the requested record from the **CAMS Database**.
- Once the record details are provided, the **System** displays them to the **Archivist**.
- The **Archivist** inputs the details of the note they wish to add (content, type, etc.).
- These new note details are then saved to the **CAMS Database** by the **System**.
- Finally, the **System** confirms the successful addition of the note to the **Archist**.

### Customization for Specific Use Case
Depending on the specific requirements and fields relevant to adding notes within the CAMS, additional steps or interactions might need to be defined. For instance, if there are validations required before adding a note, or if there are multiple steps involved in selecting the record type to which the note will be added, those would need to be detailed further in the sequence diagram.

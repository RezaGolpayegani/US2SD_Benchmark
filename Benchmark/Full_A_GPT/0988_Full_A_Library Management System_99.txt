Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the described user story involves designing a flow that shows the interaction between components for sending automatic email and SMS notifications to a customer when a book's due date has passed. Below is an example of how this could be structured:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Management System" as LMS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Notification Service" as NS
participant "Email Service" as ES
participant "SMS Service" as SS
participant "Customer" as Cust

LMS -> DB: Check overdue books
activate DB
DB --> LMS: List of overdue loans
deactivate DB

loop for each overdue loan
  LMS -> NS : Prepare notification message
  activate NS
  
  NS -> ES: Send Email Notification
  activate ES
  ES --> Cust: Email about overdue book
  deactivate ES
  
  NS -> SS: Send SMS Notification
  activate SS
  SS --> Cust: SMS about overdue book
  deactivate SS
  
  deactivate NS
end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Library Management System checking the database for any overdue books. Once identified, it initiates a notification service loop for each overdue loan to prepare the necessary notification message(s). The Notification Service then sends out both an email and an SMS notification regarding the overdue book to the customer through respective services.

- **Library Management System (LMS)**: Represents the core system that checks for overdue books.
- **Database (DB)**: Holds data regarding loans, including due dates and customer information.
- **Notification Service (NS)**: A service layer responsible for preparing and sending out notifications.
- **Email Service (ES)** and **SMS Service (SS)**: Separate services that handle the sending of email and SMS notifications, respectively.
- **Customer (Cust)**: The end recipient of the notifications.

By implementing this, the librarian ensures customers are automatically informed when the due date for a borrowed book has passed, prompting them to return it. This maintains an efficient book return system and enhances the user experience by keeping the customers informed.

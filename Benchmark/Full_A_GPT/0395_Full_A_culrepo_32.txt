Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interactions between a Cornell faculty member and the digital repository system, emphasizing the process that affects how deposited items rank in Google search results. The sequence will also highlight the roles of external systems and services, such as Google's indexing bots and search algorithms. Because enhancing an item's visibility in search results involves SEO (Search Engine Optimization) practices, metadata enrichment, and potentially the interaction with Google's Search Console, these aspects are considered in the diagram.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing the sequence diagram for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as "Cornell Faculty Member"
participant "Digital Repository System" as Repository
participant "Metadata Enrichment Module" as MetadataModule
participant "Google Indexing Bot" as GoogleBot
participant "Google Search Console" as SearchConsole
participant "Google Search" as GoogleSearch

== Deposit Item ==
FacultyMember -> Repository : Deposits item
Repository -> MetadataModule : Invoke metadata enrichment
MetadataModule -> Repository : Enriched metadata response
Repository -> FacultyMember : Item deposited successfully

== SEO and Visibility ==
Repository -> GoogleBot : Notifies of new content
alt SEO metadata present
    GoogleBot -> MetadataModule: Extracts SEO metadata
    MetadataModule -> GoogleBot: Returns enriched metadata
end

GoogleBot -> SearchConsole : Indexes item
SearchConsole -> GoogleSearch : Updates search database

== Search Item ==
FacultyMember -> GoogleSearch : Searches for deposited item
GoogleSearch -> FacultyMember : Displays item high in search results

### Explanation:
1. **Deposit Item**: The faculty member deposits an item into the digital repository system. The item can be research material, datasets, etc.

2. **Metadata Enrichment Module**: Once the item is deposited, the digital repository system invokes a metadata enrichment module to optimize the content for SEO. This module adds or updates metadata to include relevant keywords, descriptions, and other SEO practices that increase the item's visibility to search engines.

3. **Google Indexing Bot**: The repository notifies Google's indexing bot (or the bot discovers the new content through crawling). If SEO metadata is present and correctly implemented, it will be extracted and used by Google's indexing bot.

4. **Google Search Console & Google Search**: The information is indexed by Google and updated in the search database. When the faculty member or anyone searches for topics related to the deposited item, Google Search utilizes this indexed information. The enhanced metadata and adherence to SEO practices improve the likelihood that the faculty member's deposited item appears higher in the search results, targeting their goal of increased visibility and academic stardom.

This sequence diagram outlines the basic interactions and processes that can contribute to improving the visibility of deposited items in Google search results, focused on the faculty member's perspective and actions of the digital repository system and external entities like Google.

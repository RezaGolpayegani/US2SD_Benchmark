To visualize the sequence of interactions for the "Count of Books Borrowed by Users" feature in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) as described, we can create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. The scenario encapsulates a librarian wanting to know the number of books borrowed by users within a specific timeframe to potentially give them gifts.

Below is the PlantUML code outlining the sequence diagram for this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library System" as System
participant "Database" as DB

== Count Books Borrowed by Users ==
Librarian -> System : RequestCountOfBorrowedBooks(timeFrame)
activate System

System -> DB : QueryBorrowedBooksCount(timeFrame)
activate DB
DB --> System : BooksCount
deactivate DB

System -> DB : GetUsersWithBorrowCount(BooksCount)
activate DB
DB --> System : UsersList
deactivate DB

System --> Librarian : DisplayUsersAndBorrowCount(UsersList)
deactivate System

Librarian -> System : SelectUsersForGifts(SelectedUsers)
activate System

System -> DB : UpdateGiftStatusForSelectedUsers(SelectedUsers)
activate DB
DB --> System : Confirmation
deactivate DB

System --> Librarian : DisplayConfirmation(Confirmation)
deactivate System

### Explanation:

1. **Librarian to Library System:** The librarian initiates the process by requesting the count of books borrowed by users within a specific timeframe (e.g., the last month).

2. **Library System to Database (QueryBorrowedBooksCount):** The library system then communicates with the database to query the total number of books borrowed by users during the specified timeframe.

3. **Database to Library System (BooksCount):** The database responds with the count of borrowed books.

4. **Library System to Database (GetUsersWithBorrowCount):** Next, the system queries the database for a list of users who have borrowed books, alongside the count of books each has borrowed.

5. **Database to Library System (UsersList):** The database returns the list of users and their respective borrow counts.

6. **Library System to Librarian (DisplayUsersAndBorrowCount):** The library system presents the information to the librarian, who can review the users and the number of books they've borrowed.

7. **Librarian to Library System (SelectUsersForGifts):** The librarian selects users from the list to receive gifts based on the provided borrow count.

8. **Library System to Database (UpdateGiftStatusForSelectedUsers):** The library system updates the database with the gift status for the selected users, marking them as eligible for receiving gifts.

9. **Database to Library System (Confirmation):** The database confirms the updates.

10. **Library System to Librarian (DisplayConfirmation):** Finally, the library system confirms to the librarian that the selected users have been marked for gifts.

This sequence diagram represents a simplified interaction process focused on counting and rewarding users based on their book borrowing activity, as per the librarian's request.

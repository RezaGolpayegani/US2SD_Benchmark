Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML requires us to illustrate the interaction between a researcher, the Mendeley client, the Neurohub platform (specifically the group-wide shared repository feature), and possibly an external repository or databank that hosts the repository of research papers. This interaction is based on the project description provided.

Since the project aims to facilitate the integration with external tools such as Mendeley, the sequence diagram will outline the steps taken by a researcher to point their Mendeley client to a shared repository in Neurohub and how they receive notifications when new content is added. 

Let's begin with a basic setup:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as researcher
participant "Mendeley Client" as mendeley
participant "Neurohub Platform" as neurohub
participant "Group-Wide Shared\nRepository" as sharedRepo

== Pointing the Mendeley Client to the Shared Repository ==

researcher -> mendeley : Point to Shared Repository
mendeley -> neurohub : Request Access to Shared Repository
neurohub -> sharedRepo : Validate Access Request
sharedRepo -> neurohub : Access Granted
neurohub -> mendeley : Provide Repository URL/Access
mendeley -> researcher : Access Setup Complete

== Receiving Notifications on New Content Addition ==

sharedRepo -> neurohub : New Content Added Notification
neurohub -> mendeley : Push Notification
mendeley -> researcher : Display Notification

### Explanation of the Diagram

1. **Pointing the Mendeley Client to the Shared Repository:**
   - The **Researcher** initiates the process by configuring their Mendeley Client to point to the Neurohub's shared research paper repository.
   - The **Mendeley Client** sends a request to the **Neurohub Platform** for access to the said repository.
   - **Neurohub** then verifies this request with the **Group-Wide Shared Repository**.
   - Once access is granted, Neurohub communicates back to the Mendeley Client, providing necessary details such as the repository URL or access tokens as needed.
   - The Mendeley Client then confirms to the **Researcher** that the access setup to the shared repository is complete.

2. **Receiving Notifications on New Content Addition:**
   - When new content is added to the shared repository, the **Group-Wide Shared Repository** informs the **Neurohub Platform**.
   - Neurohub, in turn, pushes a notification to the **Mendeley Client**.
   - The **Mendeley Client** then notifies the **Researcher** about the new addition to the shared repository.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of how a researcher interacts with the Mendeley client and Neurohub to access and receive notifications from a group-wide shared repository. Note that the detailed implementation may require authentication, error handling, and other interactions not shown in this basic outline.

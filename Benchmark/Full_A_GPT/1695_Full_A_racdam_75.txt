To create a PlantUML sequence diagram based on your user story: "As a researcher, I want to search OCRed text in all available digitized textual documents, so that I can more efficiently locate digitized documents relevant to my research," the focus will be on the interactions between the researcher, the digital archive system (specifically the search functionality and OCR engine), and the digital archives database. This sequence will illustrate how a researcher initiates a search and how the system processes this request to return the relevant results.

Here's the PlantUML code to represent this:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "OCR Engine" as OCR
database "Digital Archives DB" as Database

Researcher -> Search : Initiates search for OCRed text
activate Search
Search -> OCR : Sends search query
activate OCR
OCR -> Database : Requests relevant documents
activate Database
Database --> OCR : Returns OCRed texts matching query
deactivate Database
OCR --> Search : Sends back search results
deactivate OCR
Search --> Researcher : Displays search results
deactivate Search
@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. **Researcher Initiates Search**: The sequence begins with the researcher inputting a search query into the search interface, specifically aimed at finding texts within digitized documents via OCR technology.

2. **Sending Query to OCR Engine**: The search interface then forwards this search query to the OCR Engine, which is responsible for interpreting and processing the text within the digitized documents.

3. **OCR Engine Requests Data from Database**: The OCR Engine queries the Digital Archives Database to retrieve documents that potentially match the search query based on the OCRed text available.

4. **Database Returns Results**: The Digital Archives Database returns the subset of documents (or the OCRed texts) that match the query parameters to the OCR Engine.

5. **Displaying Results**: The OCR Engine sends these results back to the search interface, which then displays them to the researcher, completing the process of finding relevant digitized documents based on their OCRed text.

This sequence diagram outlines the basic interactions for the described user story and highlights how the digital archive system could support efficient research through advanced OCR search capabilities.

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

- **Staff Member Actions**: The sequence begins with a staff member logging into the staff account on the County Services & Property Information Portal. After successfully logging in, the system displays the dashboard.

- **Selecting the Application**: The staff member selects an application that needs to be assigned for detailed review. The system retrieves and displays the details of the application from the Applications Database.

- **Assigning for Detailed Review**: The staff member requests to assign the application for detailed review. The system then updates the application's status in the database to "Under Detailed Review" and confirms this status update back to the system.

- **Confirmation**: Finally, the system displays a confirmation of the assignment to the staff member, indicating that the application has been successfully put under detailed review.

This sequence emphasizes the actions taken by a county staff member within the portal to begin the detailed review process for applications, focusing on system interactions, user actions, and data handling between the system and the database.

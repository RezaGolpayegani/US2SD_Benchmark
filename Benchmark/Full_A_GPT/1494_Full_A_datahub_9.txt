Generating a detailed sequence diagram based on the provided user story requires specifying the interactions between the user (Publisher) and the system components involved in the "publish command" operation. For simplicity, this example assumes the system architecture includes the user's interface (could be a CLI tool or a UI), a publishing service, a validation service, and the data registry database.

Here's a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher as publisher
participant "CLI Tool/UI" as cli
participant "Publishing Service" as publishService
participant "Validation Service" as validationService
database "Data Registry DB" as dataRegistry

== Publish Command Sequence ==

publisher -> cli : execute publish command
cli -> publishService : request data package update
publishService -> validationService : validate data package
alt Validation Success
    validationService --> publishService : validation passed
    publishService -> dataRegistry : update data package record
    dataRegistry --> publishService : confirm update
    publishService --> cli : update success message
    cli --> publisher : display success message
else Validation Fail
    validationService --> publishService : validation errors
    publishService --> cli : display validation errors
    cli --> publisher : show errors, update aborted
end

```

This sequence diagram follows the steps a Publisher would take to update a data package already in the registry:

1. The **Publisher** executes the publish command via a **CLI Tool/UI**.
2. The **CLI Tool/UI** requests the **Publishing Service** to update the data package.
3. The **Publishing Service** requests the **Validation Service** to validate the updated data package.
4. The **Validation Service** assesses the update and returns the result.
   - If validation passes, it informs the **Publishing Service**, which then updates the data package record in the **Data Registry DB**. The database confirms the update, and the **Publishing Service** sends a success message back to the **CLI Tool/UI**, which then informs the **Publisher**.
   - If validation fails, the **Validation Service** sends validation errors back to the **Publishing Service**, which forwards these errors to the **CLI Tool/UI**, and consequently, the **Publisher** is informed that the update was aborted due to these errors.

This diagram exemplifies a straightforward sequence but depending on the platform's architecture and requirements, additional steps or components might be involved in real scenarios (e.g., authentication, logging, notifications).

Given your request to generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story, we'll focus on designing a system interaction that highlights the processes a patron goes through to retrieve previous names and the publication date range of reports or datasets. The sequence diagram will involve interactions between the patron, the digital repository system's user interface (UI), the backend server, and the database system.

**PlantUML Sequence Diagram:**

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Patron
participant "UI: Digital Repository System" as UI
participant "Server: Content Management" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Patron -> UI: Accesses repository & searches for specific report/dataset
UI -> Server: Query for report/dataset details
Server -> DB: Fetch previous names, first & last publication dates
DB --> Server: Return data
Server --> UI: Display previous names & publication date range
UI --> Patron: Shows historical version information

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Patron initiates the process:** The interaction starts with the Patron accessing the digital repository system and performing a search for a specific report or dataset they are interested in.

2. **UI forwards the request to the Server:** Once the Patron has made the request, the UI of the digital repository system captures this request and forwards it to the server responsible for content management.

3. **Server requests data from the Database:** The server processes the query and sends a request to the system's database to fetch the relevant information regarding the report's or dataset's previous names, along with the publication dates of the first and the last versions.

4. **Database returns the requested data:** The database processes the server's request, retrieves the requested information, and sends it back to the server.

5. **Server sends data to the UI:** Having received the information from the database, the server then processes this data to a format that can be displayed and sends it over to the UI.

6. **Patron receives the information:** Finally, the UI updates to display the information regarding the previous names and the publication date range (from the first version to the latest version) of the report/dataset to the Patron.

This diagram assumes a simplified approach to the interaction process focused on fetching and displaying the historical version information of reports or datasets in the comprehensive digital repository system for Cornell University. Depending on the actual complexity and requirements of the system, additional steps or actors (like authentication systems or external data sources) might be involved in practice.

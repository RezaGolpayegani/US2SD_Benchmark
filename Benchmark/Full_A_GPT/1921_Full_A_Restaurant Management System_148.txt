Creating a sequence diagram involves detailing the interactions between system components (like the manager, the system interface, the database, and possibly external services) for a specific process - in this case, generating reports to examine sales. Below is a PlantUML syntax sequence diagram focused on this user story. 

This example assumes a basic interaction where the manager initiates a report generation request, the system queries the database, and then it compiles and returns a sales report to the manager. 

Please note, to render this diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment (such as an online editor, an IDE plugin, or a local PlantUML setup).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Web: Request sales report
activate Web
Web -> Backend: Fetch sales data
activate Backend
Backend -> DB: Query sales information
activate DB

DB --> Backend: Return sales data
deactivate DB
Backend -> Backend: Process & compile report
Backend --> Web: Send compiled report
deactivate Backend
Web --> Manager: Display sales report
deactivate Web
@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Sequence:**
1. **Manager Request:** The sequence begins with the manager requesting a sales report, which is done through the web interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **Web Interface to Backend System:** The web interface forwards this request to the backend system, which is responsible for handling the logic of fetching and processing the required data.

3. **Backend System Queries Database:** The backend system then makes a query to the database to fetch the necessary sales information. This could be sales data over a certain period, specific metrics the manager has requested, etc.

4. **Database Returns Data:** The database processes the query and returns the sales data back to the backend system.

5. **Report Compilation:** With the data received from the database, the backend system processes and compiles the sales report. This step may involve calculating totals, averages, or other analytics that provide insight into the sales performance.

6. **Report Sent to Web Interface:** The compiled report is then sent back to the web interface.

7. **Manager Receives the Report:** Finally, the web interface displays the sales report to the manager. 

This basic sequence diagram lays out the flow of actions for the described user story, highlighting the interactions among the system's parts to achieve the objective of generating a sales report. Adjustments and more details may be added depending on the specific requirements, such as time frames for the report, specific sales metrics, or the inclusion of visual charts within the report.

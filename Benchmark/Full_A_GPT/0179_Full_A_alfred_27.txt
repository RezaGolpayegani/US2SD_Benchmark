To depict the user story "As an OlderPerson, I want to have an ALFRED device that responds to the changing demand of the users by offering new Apps in the ALFREDO platform" using a PlantUML sequence diagram, the following elements need to be included:

1. The OlderPerson interacts with the ALFRED device to express a need or show interest in new functionalities/apps.
2. The ALFRED device collects this input and might communicate with a remote server or platform (ALFREDO) that hosts a library of apps.
3. The ALFREDO platform processes this request, and based on available apps, suggests suitable new apps to the ALFRED device.
4. The ALFRED device presents these suggestions to the OlderPerson.
5. The OlderPerson decides to download/install a new app.
6. The ALFRED device sends a request to the ALFREDO platform to download the selected app.
7. Upon successful download, the ALFRED device notifies the OlderPerson that the app is ready to use.
8. The OlderPerson starts using the new app.

Here's a basic representation of this process in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant ALFRED_Device as ALFRED
participant ALFREDO_Platform as ALFREDO
database AppLibrary

== New App Request ==
OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Expresses need for new functionality/apps
ALFRED -> ALFREDO : Requests suggestions for new apps
ALFREDO -> AppLibrary : Search for available apps
AppLibrary -> ALFREDO : Return list of apps
ALFREDO -> ALFRED : Suggests new apps
ALFRED -> OlderPerson : Displays app suggestions

== App Installation ==
OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Selects an app to install
ALFRED -> ALFREDO : Sends request to download app
ALFREDO -> AppLibrary : Fetches app
AppLibrary -> ALFREDO : Sends app to ALFRED
ALFRED -> OlderPerson : Notifies installation success
OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Starts using the new app

This diagram assumes a simplified process for requesting and installing a new app on the ALFRED device. Depending on the system's architecture and the specifics of how apps are delivered and installed, additional steps or components (like authentication, billing, or more detailed interaction flows) might be necessary.

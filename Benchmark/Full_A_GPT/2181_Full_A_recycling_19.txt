Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story involves illustrating the interactions between the user and the system (in this case, the RecycleSmart platform) that contribute to a positive UI/UX experience. The sequence diagram will outline steps such as the user accessing the platform, navigating to various functions, and the system's responses to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Given the nature of textual description and the limitations of this format, below is a conceptual representation of what the PlantUML code for such a sequence diagram could look like. This code is designed to be run in a PlantUML environment or renderer.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as user
participant "UI/UX" as uiux
participant "Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

user -> uiux: Access RecycleSmart
activate uiux
uiux -> server: RequestInitialPage()
activate server
server -> db: FetchPageData()
activate db
db --> server: PageData
deactivate db
server --> uiux: DisplayPage(Content)
deactivate server
uiux --> user: ShowHomePage
deactivate uiux

user -> uiux: EnterZipCode()
activate uiux
uiux -> server: RequestRecyclingCenters(ZipCode)
activate server
server -> db: QueryCenters(ZipCode)
activate db
db --> server: CentersList
deactivate db
server --> uiux: DisplayCenters(CentersList)
deactivate server
uiux --> user: ShowCenters(Map, Info)
deactivate uiux

user -> uiux: SelectCenter()
activate uiux
uiux -> server: RequestCenterDetails(CenterID)
activate server
server -> db: FetchDetails(CenterID)
activate db
db --> server: CenterDetails
deactivate db
server --> uiux: DisplayDetails(Details)
deactivate server
uiux --> user: ShowDetails(Info)
deactivate uiux

user -> uiux: SchedulePickUp()
activate uiux
uiux -> server: RequestPickUpSchedule(FormData)
activate server
server -> db: SavePickUpRequest(FormData)
activate db
db --> server: Confirmation
deactivate db
server --> uiux: DisplayConfirmation(Confirmation)
deactivate server
uiux --> user: ShowConfirmation(Msg)
deactivate ui_pack

This diagram represents a simplified flow where:
- The `User` interacts with the `UI/UX` of the RecycleSmart platform, such as accessing the site, entering a zip code to find nearby recycling centers, selecting a center for more details, and scheduling a pick-up.
- The `UI/UX` component handles these requests and communicates with the `Server` to process them.
- The `Server` performs actions such as fetching the initial page, querying the database for recycling centers based on the zip code, obtaining detailed information about a selected center, and processing pick-up schedules.
- The `Database` stores and provides all the necessary data.

Please note, this is a high-level overview and actual implementation details may involve more steps and components (like authentication or error handling mechanisms). This sequence diagram aims to capture the critical flows related to ensuring a great UI/UX as per the user's story.

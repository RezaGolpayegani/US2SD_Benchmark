While I can provide a conceptual sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on your request, it's worth noting that specific details or steps in the sequence might need to be adapted or expanded based on your project's unique development processes, personnel roles, and software tools. Here's a simplified version of what this sequence might look like:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Owner
participant "UI SME" as UI_SME
participant "Project Manager" as PM
participant "Development Team" as DevTeam
participant "QA Team" as QATeam
database "Project Schedule" as Schedule

Owner -> UI_SME : Request UI improvements timeline
activate UI_SME

UI_SME -> PM : Consult on UI improvements scope
activate PM
PM -> DevTeam : Assess UI improvements effort
activate DevTeam
DevTeam -> PM : Effort estimated

DevTeam -> QATeam : Estimate QA effort for UI changes
activate QATeam
QATeam -> DevTeam : QA effort estimated
deactivate QATeam

DevTeam -> PM : Combine development and QA efforts
PM -> UI_SME : Provide preliminary timeline
deactivate DevTeam
UI_SME -> Schedule : Draft UI improvements schedule
activate Schedule
Schedule -> UI_SME : Schedule confirmed
deactivate Schedule

UI_SME -> Owner : Present UI improvements schedule
deactivate UI_SME

@enduml
```

This sequence begins with the owner requesting a timeline for UI improvements from the UI Subject Matter Expert (UI SME). The UI SME consultir with the project manager (PM), who then assesses the effort required with the development team. The development team also consults with the QA team to estimate the QA effort. The combined effort leads to a preliminary timeline provided by the PM to the UI SME, who then drafts a schedule and confirms it. Finally, the UI SME presents this schedule to the owner.

Remember, this is a simplified version. Depending on your project's complexity, you might have additional steps or roles involved, such as backend engineers if data processing changes are also part of the UI improvements, or user experience designers for mockups and user testing before finalizing the schedule.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the process involving a repository operator wanting to know about the kind of data to evaluate the storage size and system via PlantUML can be intricate due to the various interactions needed with the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool). Below you will find a high-level outline of how this process might be represented as a PlantUML sequence diagram. This diagram illustrates the interactions between the repository operator, the DMPTool, and other entities like the database or metadata repository to fetch the necessary information about data types, sizes, and requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Operator" as repoOp
participant "DMPTool Interface" as dmpInt
participant "Metadata Management" as metaMan
database "Data Repository" as dataRepo
participant "Storage Analysis Tool" as storageTool

repoOp -> dmpInt: Request data information
activate dmpInt

dmpInt -> metaMan: Extract metadata info
activate metaMan

metaMan -> dataRepo: Query data types and sizes
activate dataRepo

dataRepo --> metaMan: Return data details
deactivate dataRepo

metaMan --> dmpInt: Provide aggregated metadata
deactivate metaMan

dmpInt -> storageTool: Analyze storage requirements
activate storageTool

storageTool -> storageTool: Calculate necessary storage and system specs

storageTool --> dmpInt: Return analysis results
deactivate storageTool

dmpInt --> repoOp: Display data and storage requirements
deactivate dmpInt

This sequence diagram is a conceptual representation that demonstrates the basic flow of interactions for a user story where a repository operator seeks information about the kind of data to determine storage needs. Note that in real-world scenarios, other steps and components may be involved, such as authentication, error handling, and more detailed analysis processes depending on the DMPTool's complexity and the specific data management policies of an institution or research project.

To create a sequence diagram for the specific user story you've provided — where a dataset developer wants to assign explicit versions to the code of a dataset type — we'll focus on the interactions between the dataset developer and the components of the version control system. This illustration narrows down to the process of versioning dataset types, involving the dataset developer, version control service, and possibly a datastore to manage version metadata.

Here is a PlantUML code snippet that represents the described process. This is a simplified representation and might need adjustments based on specific system architectures or additional functionalities.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Dataset Developer" as developer
participant "Version Control UI" as ui
participant "Version Control Service" as service
database "Version Metadata Store" as store

== Version Assignment ==
developer -> ui : Accesses Version Control UI
ui -> service : Request to Assign Version
activate service

service -> store : Fetch Current Version Info
activate store
store --> service : Return Current Version Data
deactivate store

service -> store : Increment Version / Assign New Version
activate store
store --> service : Version Assigned Successfully
deactivate store

service --> ui : Version Assignment Successful
ui --> developer : Display Success Message

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Dataset Developer Starts Process**: The dataset developer initiates the process by accessing the version control user interface (UI). This action is the beginning of the intention to assign a version to a dataset type's code.

2. **Request to Version Control Service**: The UI then sends a request to the backend version control service. This part of the process involves asking the service to assign a new version or simply increment an existing version for the dataset type code.

3. **Fetch Current Version Information**: The version control service communicates with a metadata store (database) to fetch the current version information of the dataset type. This is crucial for understanding the starting point or for ensuring continuity in version sequencing.

4. **Increment or Assign New Version**: Based on the fetched data, the service then increments the existing version or assigns a new version number to the dataset type code. This step could involve complex logic depending on the versioning scheme (semantic versioning, sequential integers, timestamps, etc.).

5. **Version Assigned Successfully**: The metadata store updates with the new version information and acknowledges the successful assignment to the version control service.

6. **Success Message Displayed to Developer**: Finally, the version control UI receives a confirmation of the successful version assignment and displays a success message to the dataset developer, completing the interaction sequence.

This sequence diagram is focused on the core interactions and simplifies many underlying details for brevity and clarity. Depending on the complexity of the real-world system, additional steps or checks (like authentication, authorization, error handling, etc.) may be necessary.

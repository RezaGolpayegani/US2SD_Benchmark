Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interactions between different system components or objects for the process of setting start publishing date, old news points, and stop publishing dates on a news item. Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Editor as E
participant "Content Management \n System (CMS)" as CMS
database "News Database" as DB

== Setting Publication Dates for a News Item ==

E -> CMS : Log in
activate CMS

CMS -> E : Display Dashboard
E -> CMS : Select to Create/Edit News Item
CMS -> E : Display News Item Form

E -> CMS : Fill in News Item Details
E -> CMS : Set Start Publishing Date
E -> CMS : Set Old News Date
E -> CMS : Set Stop Publishing Date
CMS -> DB : Save News Item with Dates
activate DB
DB --> CMS : Confirmation
deactivate DB

CMS -> E : Display Confirmation Message
deactivate CMS

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Log in**: The site editor logs into the Content Management System (CMS).
2. **Display Dashboard**: The CMS provides the editor with a dashboard or a control panel.
3. **Select to Create/Edit News Item**: The editor chooses to either create a new news item or edit an existing one.
4. **Display News Item Form**: The CMS presents the editor with a form to input or modify the news item details.
5. **Fill in News Item Details**: The editor enters information such as the news title, content, and other relevant details.
6. **Set Start Publishing Date**: The editor specifies the date from which the news item starts being visible to visitors.
7. **Set Old News Date**: The editor sets a date when the news item should move to an "Old News" or archive category.
8. **Set Stop Publishing Date**: The editor sets a date on which the news item should cease to be published on the platform.
9. **Save News Item with Dates**: The CMS saves the news item along with the specified dates into the News Database.
10. **Confirmation**: A confirmation of the successful operation is sent from the database back to the CMS and then to the editor.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation of the process. Depending on specific requirements and system complexity, additional steps or components (like authentication checks, validation of input data, and logging of actions) might be necessary for a complete implementation.

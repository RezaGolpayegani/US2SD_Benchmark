Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the process of how work moves from the UX/content phase to the visual design phase, and then to the front-end development phase within a sprint cycle, is a great way to visualize project workflows. Below is an example sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines this process. Note that this is a simplified diagram to capture the essence of the sprint cycle and interactions between team members and artifacts. 

For a real-world project, you might need to adapt it further to match your project's complexities and team structure.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor TeamMember
participant "UX/Content Team" as UX
participant "Design Team" as Design
participant "Front-End Development Team" as FE
database "CMS" as CMS
database "Design System" as DesignSys
database "Version Control" as VC

UX -> CMS : Identify content needs

== Development Handoff ==
TeamMember -> FE : Hand off designs for development
activate FE
FE -> VC : Checkout new branch

FE -> DesignSys : Integrate visual designs & tokens
FE -> FE : Implement design in code
FE -> VC : Commit changes
VC --> FE : Changes committed
FE --> TeamMember : Sprint Work Completed

This diagram starts with the sprint planning phase, where team members define requirements and user stories that UX/Content Teams use to guide their content strategy and wireframing. After UX testing and iterations, finalized wireframes and content strategy are handed off to the Design Team to develop visual mockups, adhering to established design tokens and guidelines found in the design system. Following the design phase, the Front-End Development Team is responsible for implementing these designs into code, with changes tracked through a version control system. Throughout the process, continuous collaboration and feedback between teams and team members are implied, though not explicitly shown in every step for brevity.

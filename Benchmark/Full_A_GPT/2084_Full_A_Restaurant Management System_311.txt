To visualize the sequence of interactions involving a waiter selecting order items in the Restaurant Management and Operations System, we'll use PlantUML language to create the sequence diagram. This diagram illustrates the communication flow between the waiter, the system interface, and the backend components to accomplish this task.

Given the complexity, this diagram simplifies the process focusing on the key interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant Database

Waiter -> UI : Selects "Create New Order"
UI -> OMS : Initiate Order Creation
OMS -> Database : Fetch Menu Items
Database --> OMS : Return Menu Items
OMS --> UI : Display Menu Items
Waiter -> UI : Select Order Items
UI -> OMS : Send Selected Items
OMS -> Database : Validate Items & Check Availability
alt Items Valid and Available
    Database --> OMS : Confirm Items Available
    OMS --> UI : Confirm & Display Order Summary
    Waiter -> UI : Confirms Order
    UI -> OMS : Finalize Order
    OMS -> Database : Save Order Details
    Database --> OMS : Order Saved Successfully
    OMS --> UI : Display Order Successful Message
    Waitor -> UI : Confirm receipt of success message
else Some Items Not Available
    Database --> OMS : Item Availability Error
    OMS --> UI : Error Message (Item Not Available)
    Waiter -> UI : Adjusts Order Selection
    UI -> OMS : Resend Revised Items
    [-> OMS : Repeat Validation Process
endif

In this diagram:
- **Waiter**: Initiates the process by creating a new order and selecting items from the menu.
- **UI Interface**: Acts as the intermediary for input and output interactions between the waiter and the system.
- **Order Management System (OMS)**: Handles the logic to initiate order creation, item selection, validation, and finalization.
- **Database**: Stores and manages data on menu items, availability, and order details.

This sequence starts with the waiter selecting to create a new order and ends with the system confirming the order has been successfully saved, ready to be processed further. It includes decision paths for handling cases where selected items might not be available, requiring item selection adjustments.

To render this PlantUML diagram, you would use a PlantUML environment or tool that supports the PlantUML language, allowing you to visualize the sequence diagram described by this code.

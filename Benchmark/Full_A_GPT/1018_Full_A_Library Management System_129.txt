To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a library manager wants to view the condition of each book to determine if it needs to be replaced, you can follow this structure in PlantUML format. This example assumes the interaction between the library manager, the system interface, and the system's backend database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryManager as LM
participant "CLMS Interface" as UI
participant "Book Management System" as BMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Check Condition of Books ==
LM -> UI : Request book list
activate LM
activate UI

UI -> BMS : Fetch book details
activate BMS

BMS -> DB : Query book data (including condition)
activate DB

DB --> BMS : Return book data
deactivate DB

BMS --> UI : Show books and conditions
deactivate BMS

UI --> LM : Display book list and conditions
deactivate UI

LM -> UI : Select book with poor condition
activate UI

UI -> BMS : Request detailed condition for selected book
activate BMS

BMS -> DB : Query detailed condition for book
activate DB

DB --> BMS : Return detailed condition
deactivate DB

BMS --> UI : Show detailed book condition
deactivate BMS

UI --> LM : Display book condition details
deactivate UI

LM -> UI : Initiates replacement process
activate UI

UI -> BMS : Trigger book replacement workflow
activate BMS

BMS -> DB : Update book status to "toBeReplaced"
activate DB

DB --> BMS : Confirm status updated
deactivate DB

BMS --> UI : Confirm initiation of replacement
deactivate BMS

UI --> LM : Display replacement initiation confirmation
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram outlines the process of how a library manager interacts with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to assess the condition of the books and initiate a replacement for those that are found to be in poor condition. The flow starts with the manager requesting the book list, followed by inspecting the condition of each book, and finally initiating the replacement process for books marked with poor conditions based on the detailed information provided by the system.

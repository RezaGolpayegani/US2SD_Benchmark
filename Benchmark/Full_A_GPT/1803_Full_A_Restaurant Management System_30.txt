Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described project, especially for the specific user story "As a chef, I want to update expiry dates," involves showcasing the interactions between the chef, the system's backend, and the database. Below is a textual representation of a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines these interactions.

Please note, to convert this textual representation into a visual diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Chef as chef
participant "UI Layer" as ui
participant "Backend\n(Server)" as backend
database "Database" as db

chef -> ui : Selects ingredient to update
ui -> backend : Requests current expiry date
backend -> db : Queries ingredient expiry date
db -> backend : Returns expiry date
backend -> ui : Shows current expiry date
chef -> ui : Inputs new expiry date
ui -> backend : Submits updated expiry date
backend -> db : Updates expiry date in database
db -> backend : Confirms update
backend -> ui : Confirms successful update to chef
ui -> chef : Display update confirmation

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Chef**: The actor who initiates the process by selecting an ingredient whose expiry date needs to be updated.
- **UI Layer**: The frontend interface where the chef interacts with the system. This layer receives the chef's selections and inputs, and displays information returned from the backend.
- **Backend (Server)**: This component processes requests from the UI layer, interacts with the database to fetch or update data, and sends responses back to the UI layer.
- **Database**: The storage system where all data related to ingredients, including their expiry dates, are kept.

### Steps Illustrated in the Diagram:
1. The chef selects an ingredient to update its expiry date through the user interface (UI).
2. The UI sends a request to the backend to retrieve the current expiry date of the selected ingredient.
3. The backend queries the database for the expiry date.
4. The database returns the current expiry date to the backend.
5. The backend sends the current expiry date to the UI.
6. The UI displays the current expiry date to the chef.
7. The chef inputs the new expiry date into the UI.
8. The UI submits the updated expiry date to the backend.
9. The backend updates the expiry date in the database.
10. The database confirms the update to the backend.
11. The backend confirms the successful update to the UI.
12. The UI displays a confirmation of the update to the chef.

This sequence diagram provides a simplified overview of the process a chef would follow to update the expiry dates of ingredients within the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

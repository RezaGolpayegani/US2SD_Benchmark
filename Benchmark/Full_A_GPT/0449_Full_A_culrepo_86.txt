Creating a PlantUML sequence diagram based on the provided user story requires breaking down the sequence of interactions involved in changing a password or retrieving a forgotten one into specific actions. Below is an example of how such a sequence diagram can be scripted in PlantUML language, considering a DB/IR administrator's interactions with the digital repository system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "DB/IR Administrator" as admin
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Database" as db

== Change Password ==
admin -> auth : Request password change
auth -> admin : Prompt current password
admin -> auth : Submit current password
auth -> db : Validate current password
db -> auth : Password validation result
alt If password is valid
  auth -> admin : Prompt new password
  admin -> auth : Submit new password
  auth -> db : Update password
  db -> auth : Confirmation of update
  auth -> admin : Display confirmation message
else If password is invalid
  auth -> admin : Display error message
end

== Retrieve Forgotten Password ==
admin -> auth : Select "Forgot Password?"
auth -> admin : Prompt for recovery email
admin -> auth : Submit recovery email
auth -> db : Validate recovery email
alt If email exists
  db -> auth : Email validation success
  auth -> admin : Send recovery link to email
  admin -> auth : Access link from email
  auth -> admin : Prompt to set new password
  admin -> auth : Submit new password
  auth -> db : Update password in DB
  db -> auth : Confirmation of password update
  auth -> admin : Display confirmation message
else If email does not exist
  db -> auth : Email validation failure
  auth -> admin : Display error message
end

### Explanation:

1. **Change Password Flow:**
   - The DB/IR Administrator initiates a password change request.
   - The Authentication System asks for the current password and validates it against the Database.
   - If the current password is correct, the Authentication System prompts for a new password, updates it in the Database, and confirms the change to the Administrator.
   - If the current password is incorrect, an error message is displayed.

2. **Retrieve Forgotten Password Flow:**
   - The DB/IR Administrator indicates they forgot their password.
   - The Authentication System prompts for a recovery email, which it checks against the Database.
   - If the email is found, a recovery link is sent to the Administrator's email. The link leads to a page where a new password can be set, which is then updated in the Database.
   - If the recovery email is not found in the Database, an error message is displayed.

This sequence diagram outlines the main interactions without delving into lower-level implementation details, which would depend on the specific technologies and frameworks used in the project.

Here's a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram describing the process by which a Cornell faculty member creates a branded collection for documents. This user story encapsulates multiple actions, including authentication, collection creation, document upload, branding application, and finally, saving and sharing the collection. 

Please note, while sequence diagrams are great for depicting detailed interactions, due to the complexity and the limitations of text-based descriptions, this representation simplifies some interactions for clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as FM
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Collection Management" as CM
participant "Document Upload" as DU
participant "Branding Interface" as BI
participant "Repository Database" as DB

== Authentication ==
FM -> Auth: Provide Credentials
Auth -> FM: Authentication Success

== Collection Creation ==
FM -> CM: Create New Collection
CM -> DB: Initialize Collection Record
DB -> CM: Confirm Collection Initialization
CM -> FM: Collection Created Notification

== Document Upload ==
FM -> DU: Select Documents for Upload
DU -> DB: Save Documents to Collection
DB -> DU: Confirm Documents Saved
DU -> FM: Documents Uploaded Notification

== Apply Branding ==
FM -> BI: Open Branding Interface
BI -> CM: Fetch Collection Details
CM -> BI: Return Collection Details
FM -> BI: Apply Branding (Logo, Colors, Metadata)
BI -> DB: Update Collection with Branding
DB -> BI: Confirm Branding Applied
BI -> FM: Branding Applied Notification

== Finalization ==
FM -> CM: Publish Collection
CM -> DB: Update Collection Status to Published
DB -> CM: Confirm Collection Published
CM -> FM: Collection Published Notification

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format involves mapping out the interactions between the researcher and the comprehensive digital repository system, alongside any other participating actors or systems. Here is how this could be outlined based on the provided project description:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Researcher" as researcher
participant "Repository System" as system
participant "Notification Service" as notification
participant "Content Database" as database
participant "External Systems" as external

researcher -> system : Search research by topic
activate system

system -> database : Query topic
activate database
database --> system : Return results
deactivate database

system --> researcher : Display research materials
deactivate system

researcher -> system : Subscribe to topic updates
activate system

system -> notification : Create subscription
activate notification
notification --> system : Confirmation
deactivate notification

system --> researcher : Subscription confirmed
deactivate system

loop Periodic Updates
    system -> database : Check for new materials
    activate database
    database --> system : New materials on topic
    deactivate database

    system -> notification : Prepare update notification
    activate notification
    notification -> researcher : Send update notification
    deactivate notification
end

loop On New Publication
    external -> system : Notify new publication
    activate system

    system -> notification : Verify topic relevance
    activate notification
    notification -> researcher : Send relevant notification
    deactivate notification

    deactivate  system
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the following process:

1. **Search Initialization**: The researcher initiates a search within the repository system for research materials related to a specific topic, including materials from other departments or schools.
   
2. **Subscription**: Following the discovery of relevant materials, the researcher subscribes to updates on this topic to stay informed about new research.

3. **Periodic Updates**: The system periodically checks for new materials matching the subscription criteria and notifies the researcher through the notification service when such materials are available. 

4. **New Publication Notification**: Additionally, when new publications are added to the repository that match the topic of interest, the system receives a notification (possibly from external systems or through internal processes), verifies the relevance to the subscribed topics, and sends a notification to the researcher.

5. **Interaction with External Systems**: The diagram also suggests the possibility of interaction with external systems (like digital management tools or academic databases) that could trigger notifications of new publications relevant to the researcherâ€™s interests.

This diagram is a high-level representation and can be expanded with more specific interactions, error handling, and system responses to provide a more detailed blueprint for system development and integration.

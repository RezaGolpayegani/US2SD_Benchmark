To create a detailed sequence diagram for the aforementioned user story ("As a customer, I want to see new dishes so that I can try new flavors.") using PlantUML syntax, we'll outline the sequence of actions that occur when a customer accesses the system to view new dishes. This involves interactions primarily between the customer, the front-end user interface, the back-end server, and the database where the dish information is stored.

Please note that the actual implementation can vary depending on specific system designs and requirements. However, the following example aims to provide a general idea of how these interactions could be laid out in a sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant CustomerUI as "Customer Interface"
participant Server as "Back-end Server"
participant Database as "Database"

title View New Dishes Sequence Diagram

CustomerUI -> Server: Request to view new dishes
activate Server

Server -> Database: Query for new dishes
activate Database

Database --> Server: Return new dishes data
deactivate Database

Server --> CustomerUI: Display new dishes
deactivate Server

CustomerUI -> CustomerUI: Customer views new dishes

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Customer Interface**: This represents the front-end user interface through which the customer interacts with the system. It could be a web page or a mobile app.
- **Back-end Server**: This is the server-side component that processes requests from the front-end interface. It handles business logic, including fetching the requested data from the database.
- **Database**: This stores all the information about the dishes, including details about new additions to the menu.

### Sequence of Actions:
1. The customer uses the interface to request to view new dishes.
2. This request is sent from the Customer Interface to the Back-end Server.
3. The Back-end Server then queries the Database for information on new dishes.
4. The Database returns the data on the new dishes to the Back-end Server.
5. The Back-end Server processes this data and sends it back to the Customer Interface.
6. Finally, the Customer Interface displays the new dishes to the customer for viewing.

This sequence diagram focuses on outlining the high-level interactions and flow of information between components involved in viewing new dishes from the customer's perspective. Further details can be added depending on the complexity of the system's functionality and the specific technologies used.

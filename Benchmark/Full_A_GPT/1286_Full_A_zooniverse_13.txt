Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to identify products in videos, and receive related information about them" involves outlining the interaction between the user, the system (AMIDP), and potentially external services or databases that help identify products and fetch related information. Below is a PlantUML representation of how these interactions could be structured.

Please note, to render the following PlantUML code, you'll need to use a PlantUML compiler or an online editor that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "AMIDP Frontend" as Frontend
participant "AMIDP Backend" as Backend
participant "Content Identification Service" as ContentID
participant "Product Information Database" as ProductDB

User -> Frontend: Selects video and requests product identification
activate Frontend
Frontend -> Backend: Request to identify products in the video
activate Backend

Backend -> ContentID: Send video for product identification
activate ContentID
ContentID -> ContentID: Analyze video and identify products
ContentID --> Backend: Return identified products' identifiers
deactivate ContentID

Backend -> ProductDB: Request information for identified products
activate ProductDB
ProductDB -> ProductDB: Fetch information based on identifiers
ProductDB --> Backend: Return product information
deactivate ProductDB

Backend --> Frontend: Send product information to Frontend
deactivate Backend
Frontend --> User: Display product information
deactivate Frontend

This sequence diagram illustrates the following process:
1. The user selects a video and requests to identify products within it through the AMIDP frontend interface.
2. The AMIDP frontend sends this request to the backend system.
3. The AMIDP backend forwards the video to a specialized content identification service.
4. The content identification service analyzes the video, identifies products, and returns the identifiers of these products to the AMIDP backend.
5. The AMIDP backend then queries a product information database with the received product identifiers.
6. The product information database returns detailed information about each identified product to the backend.
7. The AMIDP backend sends this information back to the frontend.
8. Finally, the frontend displays the received product information to the user.

This flow ensures the user can identify products in videos and receive related information efficiently, leveraging advanced media identification technologies.

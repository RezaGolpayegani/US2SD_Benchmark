Given your request for a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to see the number of reservations of a book until now so that I can think of its popularity," below is a representation using Plant UML syntax. This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the Library Member (User), Frontend Interface, Backend System, and Database necessary to fetch and display the number of reservations for a particular book.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as "Library Member"
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

User -> Frontend : Request to view book details
Frontend -> Backend : Fetch book details and reservation count
Backend -> DB : Query reservation count for book
DB -> Backend : Return reservation count
Backend -> Frontend : Display book details with reservation count
Frontend -> User : Show book details and reservation popularity

### Description of the Sequence:
1. **Library Member Initiates Request:** The sequence begins with the library member requesting to view the details of a specific book through the frontend interface. This user action implies they have navigated to the section of the application where book details are shown.

2. **Frontend Request to Backend:** The frontend interface captures this request and forwards it to the backend system. This request includes obtaining all relevant details of the book, including the number of times it has been reserved.

3. **Backend Queries Database:** Upon receiving the request from the frontend, the backend system queries the database to retrieve the current reservation count for the specified book. This step may involve processing to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date.

4. **Database Responds with Data:** The database processes the query from the backend and returns the information requested, including the reservation count for the book.

5. **Backend Processes and Sends Data:** With the database response, the backend system processes the data as needed for the frontend display. This may include formatting or combining the reservation count with other relevant book details.

6. **Frontend Displays Information:** Finally, the frontend interface presents the book details, including the number of reservations, to the library member. This information helps the member gauge the popularity of the book, as outlined in the user story.

### Additional Notes:
- For simplicity, error handling, authentication, and other intermediate steps are not shown in this sequence diagram.
- The actual technology stack (specific languages, database systems, etc.) for frontend, backend, and database components is not specified and can vary based on implementation choices.
- Modifications may be required to fit the specific architecture and requirements of the Comprehensive Library Bobby Management System (CLMS) project.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interaction flow for retrieving and displaying a book's reservation count, aligning with the user's goal of assessing the book's popularity based on its reservation history.

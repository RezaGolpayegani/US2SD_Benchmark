Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the user (in this case, the collection curator) and the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) components required to create deposit forms specific to each collection. Here is a high-level representation of how this process could be modeled using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Curator as C
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Form Management Module" as FMM
participant "Collection Database" as DB
participant "Form Template Storage" as FTS

C -> UI: Accesses deposit form creation page
UI -> FMM: Requests available form templates
FMM -> FTS: Retrieve form templates
FTS --> FMM: Form templates
FMM --> UI: Display templates
UI --> C: Shows form templates

C -> UI: Selects a template & customizes it
UI -> FMM: Submits customized form data
FMM -> FMM: Validate form customization
alt Successful Validation
    FMM -> DB: Create new form entry for collection
    DB --> FMM: Confirmation
    FMM --> UI: Success Message
    UI --> C: Shows success notification
else Validation Failure
    FMM --> UI: Error Message
    UI --> C: Shows error notification & reasons
end

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Curator (`C`)**: This participant is the collection curator who initiates the process to create a collection-specific deposit form.
- **UI Interface (`UI`)**: Acts as the intermediary that the curator interacts with to select, customize, and submit the deposit form.
- **Form Management Module (`FMM`)**: This module processes requests from the UI, interacting with both the form template storage and the collection database to manage form templates and collection-specific form entries.
- **Collection Database (`DB`)**: Stores information about the collections and the forms associated with each collection.
- **Form Template Storage (`FTES`)**: Holds the available form templates that the curator can choose from and customize.

The sequence starts with the curator accessing the deposit form creation page and ends with either a success notification (if the form is validated and stored successfully) or an error notification (if the validation fails). The diagram includes decision making (alt, else) to capture the conditional steps based on the outcome of form validation.

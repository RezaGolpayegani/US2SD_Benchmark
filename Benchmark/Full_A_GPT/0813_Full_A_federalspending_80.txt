Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you provided involves depicting the interactions between various components within the system to fulfill the user's request for information on the number of rows that will be published before they decide to actually publish. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that visualizes these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant UI
participant ValidationService
participant DataService
participant Database

User -> UI : Request to view publishable data
UI -> ValidationService : Validate data view request
alt Valid request
    ValidationService -> DataService : Fetch pre-publishing data summary
    DataService -> Database : Query publishable rows
    Database -> DataService : Return row count
    DataService -> UI : Show number of rows to be published
    UI -> User : Display row count and ask for confirmation to publish
else Invalid request
    ValidationService -> UI : Show error message
    UI -> User : Display validation error
end

User -> UI : Confirm publishing decision
alt Decides to publish
    UI -> DataService : Initiate data publishing
    DataService -> Database : Publish rows
    Database -> DataService : Confirm rows published
    DataService -> UI : Display success message
    UI -> User : Show publishing success
else Decides not to publish
    UI -> User : Cancel publishing process
end

```

Here's a breakdown of what the diagram represents:

1. **User requests to view publishable data:** The sequence starts with the user interacting with the system's User Interface (UI) to request information on the number of rows that are ready to be published.

2. **Validation of request:** The UI sends the request to a ValidationService to ensure the request is valid (e.g., the user has the right permissions and data is in a state that can be pre-viewed).

3. **Fetching data summary:** If the request is valid, the ValidationService requests a summary of pre-publishing data, such as the count of rows eligible for publishing, from the DataService.

4. **Database query for row count:** The DataService then queries the Database to get the actual number of publishable rows.

5. **Display row count to user:** The DataService sends this information back to the UI, which in turn displays it to the user, along with a prompt asking if they wish to proceed with publishing.

6. **User makes a publishing decision:** The user confirms whether they want to publish the data.

7. **Decision to publish or not:** If the user decides to proceed, the DataService is instructed to publish the data to the Database, which then sends a confirmation back that the rows have been published, resulting in a success message displayed to the user. If the user decides not to publish, the process is simply canceled.

This PlantUML sequence diagram encapsulates the user story's requirement by illustrating the necessary steps to inform the user about the number of rows ready for publishing and handling their decision on whether or not to proceed with the publication.

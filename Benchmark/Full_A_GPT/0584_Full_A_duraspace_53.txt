Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story provided involves depicting the sequence of interactions between actors (such as the DAMS manager and preservation managers) and the system modules/components to achieve the goal of indicating the checksum and checksum method for each master file of a given object. Here's a PlantUML script to illustrate these interactions in a sequence diagram.

```
@startuml

participant "DAMS Manager" as DAMSManager
participant "DIMS User Interface" as UI
participant "Digital Asset\nManagement System" as DAMS
participant "Preservation\nManagement Module" as Preservation
participant "Repository Database" as Database

DAMSManager -> UI: Accesses preservation details form
activate UI

UI -> DAMS: Request to retrieve master file data for an object
activate DAMS

DAMS -> Database: Fetch master file information
activate Database
Database --> DAMS: Return master file information
deactivate Database

DAMS --> UI: Display master file details
deactivate DAMS

UI --> DAMSManager: Shows master file details and input form for checksum and method
deactivate UI

DAMSManager -> UI: Inputs checksum and checksum method
activate UI

UI -> Preservation: Send checksum information
activate Preservation

Preservation -> Database: Update master file with checksum details
activate Database
Database --> Preservation: Confirm checksum update
deactivate Database

Preservation --> UI: Display success message
deactivate Preservation

UI --> DAMSManager: Confirm checksum indication to preservation managers
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram starts with the DAMS Manager accessing the preservation details form through the DIMS User Interface (UI). The UI requests the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) to retrieve master file data for a specified object. The DAMS fetches this information from the Repository Database and displays it to the DAMS Manager through the UI.

The DAMS Manager inputs the checksum and checksum method for each master file into the UI, which sends this information to the Preservation Management Module. The Preservation Management Module updates the master file details with the checksum information in the Repository Database and confirms the update. A success message is then displayed to the DAMS Manager, confirming that the checksum and its method have been indicated to the preservation managers.

To visualize this diagram, you would need to use a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story requires a clear understanding of the interactions between the system components involved in the process of a chef adding new dishes to the menu. Below is a simplified example of how these interactions could be modeled in PlantUML. This example assumes the chef interacts with a user interface to submit new dish details, which then get processed by the backend server and ultimately stored in the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Chef as chef
participant "UI: Menu Management" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
local Storage as db

chef -> ui : selects "Add New Dish"
activate chef
activate ui
ui -> server : sends new dish details
activate server

server -> db : process dish details
activate db
db -> db : validate data
db -> db : store new dish data
db --> server : success message

deactivate db
server --> ui : display confirmation message
deactivate server
ui --> chef : show success message
deactivate ui
deactivate chef

@enduml
```

**Explanation**:
- **Chef**: The actor initiating the process by deciding to add a new dish.
- **UI: Menu Management**: The user interface component where the chef enters the details of the new dish to be added.
- **Backend Server**: The server component processes the request, performs business logic, communicates with the database, and sends back responses.
- **Storage**: Represents the database where the new dish details are stored.

**Steps**:
1. The chef selects the option to add a new dish in the Menu Management UI.
2. The chef enters the details of the new dish, which are sent to the backend server by the UI.
3. The server processes the request, which includes validating the data against business rules and storing the new dish details in the database.
4. The database confirms the successful storage of the dish details.
5. The server sends a success message back to the UI.
6. The UI displays a confirmation message to the chef, letting them know the dish has been successfully added.

Remember, this is a simplified diagram and the actual implementation could involve more steps, including error handling, authentication, and interaction with other microservices or APIs (e.g., for ingredient inventory checks).

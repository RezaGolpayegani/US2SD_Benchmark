Given your request, here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the process for a library member who wants to delete an online book reservation through the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

actor Member
participant "Reservation Interface" as RI
participant "Reservation System" as RS
database "Database" as DB

== Delete Online Book Reservation ==

Member -> RI: Select reservation to delete
RI -> RS: Request deletion of reservation (reservationId)
RS -> DB: Query reservation by reservationId
DB --> RS: Return reservation details
RS -> DB: Delete reservation record
DB --> RS: Confirm deletion
RS --> RI: Display deletion confirmation
RI -> Member: Display deletion success message

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the following steps in the process of deleting an online book reservation:

1. **Member interaction**: The library member starts the process by selecting the reservation they wish to delete through the Reservation Interface.
2. **Reservation Interface to Reservation System**: The interface forwards the deletion request, including the unique reservation ID, to the Reservation System.
3. **Reservation System queries the Database**: The Reservation System queries the database to fetch the details of the reservation identified by the given reservation ID.
4. **Database returns reservation details**: The Database finds and returns the details of the specified reservation to the Reservation System.
5. **Reservation System requests deletion**: After fetching the reservation details, the Reservation System requests to delete the reservation record from the Database.
6. **Database confirms deletion**: The Database deletes the reservation record and confirms the deletion to the Reservation System.
7. **Reservation System to Reservation Interface**: The Reservation System sends a confirmation of the deletion back to the Reservation Interface.
8. **Reservation Interface notifies the Member**: Finally, the Reservation Interface displays a success message to the library member, confirming that the reservation has been successfully deleted.

This sequence diagram outlines a comprehensive view on how the different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System interact with each other to allow a library member to delete a book reservation successfully.

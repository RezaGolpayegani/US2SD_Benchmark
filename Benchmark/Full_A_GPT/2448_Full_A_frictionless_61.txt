Given the complexity of the project description and the user story provided, creating a detailed sequence diagram involves capturing the sequence of interactions between the systems, actors, and components involved in creating proxy Data Packages for well-known and reliable data sources. Below is a PlantUML code representation of such a process, tailored to reflect the operations from the perspective of a researcher utilizing the DPIE project's capabilities.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "DPIE App" as app
database "Data Sources" as ds
participant "Data Package\nTooling" as dpt
database "DataPackage Repository" as dpr

== Proxy Data Package Creation ==
res -> app : Request creation\nof proxy Data Package
app -> ds : Identify authoritative\ndata sources
ds -> app : Return list of sources
app -> app : Select appropriate sources\nbased on reliability & quality
app -> dpt : Generate proxy Data Package\nspecification
dpt -> dpr : Store proxy Data Package
dpt -> app : Return proxy Data Package\nURL & metadata
app -> res : Provide proxy Data Package\ndetails & access instructions

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the Researcher requesting the creation of a proxy Data Package via the DPIE App. The app then identifies authoritative data sources and selects appropriate ones based on reliability and quality criteria. It generates a proxy Data Package specification using Data Package tooling, which involves storing the package in a repository and returning its URL and metadata to the researcher.

To compile this PlantUML code:

1. Copy the provided code.
2. Use a PlantUML editor or an online PlantUML tool like [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/) or [PlantUML QEditor](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).
3. Paste the code into the editor and generate the diagram.

This visualization facilitates understanding of the sequence of operations involved in creating a proxy Data Package from identifying suitable data sources to providing the researcher with access to the generated package.

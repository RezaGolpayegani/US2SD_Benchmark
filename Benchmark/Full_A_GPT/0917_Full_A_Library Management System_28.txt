To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story, "As a librarian, I want to be able to see the list of overdue books," follow the sequence below. This representation involves interactions between the Librarian (User), Library Management System Interface, and the Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant "Library Management\nSystem Interface" as UI
database "Library Database" as DB

L -> UI : Request list of overdue books
activate UI

UI -> DB : Query overdue books
activate DB

DB --> UI : Overdue books list
deactivate DB

UI --> L : Display overdue books
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

This simple sequence diagram outlines the following process:

1. The librarian requests the list of overdue books from the Library Management System Interface.
2. The system interface queries the Library Database for overdue books.
3. The database returns the list of overdue books to the system interface.
4. Finally, the system interface displays the list of overdue books to the librarian.

The above sequence diagram can be easily expanded or modified based on additional requirements, such as filtering the list by book title, author, or the borrower's name, or integrating notification actions for sending reminders to borrowers with overdue books.

Given the specific request for crafting a PlantUML sequence diagram based on the user story from the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) project description, below is a detailed example showcasing the process involving repository managers, the repository management system, the financial tracking module, and potentially other systems or database elements essential for tracing financial responsibility of repository items.

Note: The code outlined is to be used with PlantUML or a compatible tool that can interpret and generate sequence diagrams from this textual representation.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant RepositoryManager as RM "Repository Manager"
participant EDRMS_UI as GUI "EDRMS User Interface"
participant FinancialTrackingModule as FTM
participant Database as DB "Database"

title Tracking Financial Responsibility Sequence

RM -> GUI : Select item to assign financial contact
activate RM
activate GUI

GUI -> FTM : Request financial contact form
activate FTM

FTM -> GUI : Respond with contact form

GUI -> RM : Display financial contact form
deactivate FTM

RM -> GUI : Submit financial contact details\n(name, phone, email, title, address)
activate FTM

GUI -> FTM : Validate submitted details
FTM -> DB : Query to check if contact exists
activate DB
DB -> FTM : Return query result
deactivate DB

alt If contact does not exist
    FTM -> DB : Create new contact record
    activate DB
    DB -> FTM : Confirm creation
    deactivate DB
end

FTM -> DB : Link contact to item
activate DB
DB -> FTM : Confirm linkage success
deactivate DB

FTM -> GUI : Notify update success
GUI -> RM : Display success message

deactivate FTM
deactivate GUI
deactivate RM

This sequence diagram starts with the Repository Manager selecting an item to assign a financial contact through the EDRMS User Interface (GUI). The flow then proceeds to request and display a financial contact form, followed by submission and validation of the provided contact details. The Financial Tracking Module (FTM) interacts with the database to either create a new contact record or update an existing one. Depending on the outcome, the FTM communicates the success back to the GUI, which in turn notifies the Repository Manager. Error handling and alternative flows (such as validation failures) should also be considered for a complete implementation but are not covered in this basic sequence to focus on the key steps described in the user story.

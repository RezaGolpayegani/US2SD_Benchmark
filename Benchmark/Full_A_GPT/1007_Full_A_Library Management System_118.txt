Given the project description and focusing on the user story about generating reports on book genres to make decisions on collection expansion, below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram outlines the process from the perspective of a library manager who wants to generate these reports.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Web : Request report generation on book genres
activate Web
Web -> Backend : Request book genre statistics
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Query book genres and their statistics
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return query results
deactivate DB
Backend -> Backend : Process and compile report data
Backend --> Web : Send compiled report data
deactivate Backend
Web --> Manager : Display report on book genres

#### Explanation:

- **Actor (Manager):** This is the library manager, who initiates the process by requesting a report on book genres.
  
- **Web Interface (Web):** Acts as the frontend through which the library manager interacts with the CLMS. It receives the request to generate a report on book genres.
  
- **Backend System (Backend):** This is the server-side application logic that processes the manager's request. It interacts with the database to fetch the required data and compiles it into a readable report.
  
- **Database (DB):** This stores all the data related to books, including genre information, borrowing statistics etc. It processes queries from the backend system and returns results.
  
**Flow:**

1. The library manager requests a report on book genres via the web interface.
2. The web interface forwards this request to the backend system.
3. The backend system queries the database for book genres and their borrowing statistics or any other relevant metrics.
4. The database returns the queried data to the backend system.
5. The backend system then processes this data, compiling it into a report format suitable for the library manager's needs.
6. This compiled report data is sent back through the web interface.
7. Finally, the web interface displays the report to the library manager, who can use it to make informed decisions about expanding the library's collection. 

This sequence diagram represents a simplification of what would likely be a more complex process involving authentication and authorization steps, error handling, and possibly interactions with other microservices or external APIs for comprehensive reporting capabilities.

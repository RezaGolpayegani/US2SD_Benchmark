Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story requires visualizing the interactions between various system components and actors in the process of indicating source-capture information for a file. Below is a PlantUML code that illustrates these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DAMS Manager" as manager
participant "DIMS Interface" as interface
participant "Repository Management" as repo_management
participant "Database" as db
participant "Event and Integrity\nMonitoring Module" as integrity_monitor

== Indicate Source-Capture Information for a File ==

manager -> interface : Select file to update
interface -> repo_management : Request file details
repo_management -> db : Query file by ID
db -> repo_management : File details
repo_management -> interface : Display file details
interface -> manager : Show file details

manager -> interface : Enter source-capture information
interface -> repo_management : Validate information
repo_management -> integrity_monitor : Verify integrity and format
integrity_monitor -> repo_management : Validation results
repo_management -> db : Update file with source-capture information
db -> repo_management : Confirmation of update
repo_management -> interface : Update successful
interface -> manager : Display success message

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the process from the DAMS manager's decision to indicate source-capture information for a specific file through to the successful update of the information in the system. The steps include:
- The DAMS manager selects the file to update via the DIMS Interface.
- The DIMS Interface requests and displays the file details from the Repository Management system.
- The DAMS manager enters the source-capture information into the system.
- The information is validated by the Repository Management system and checked for integrity and correct format by the Event and Integrity Monitoring Module.
- Upon successful validation, the Repository Management system updates the file with the new source-capture information in the database.
- A success message is displayed to the DAMS manager.

This sequence diagram emphasizes the system's internal interactions and the flow of information, demonstrating how the DIMS ensures data integrity, validation, and user feedback in the process of updating file metadata.

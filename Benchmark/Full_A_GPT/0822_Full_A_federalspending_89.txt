Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the requested user story in PlantUML format would involve illustrating the sequence of events that a Developer would go through to quickly access application data for issue investigation. For simplicity, let's assume the process involves the Developer engaging with a logging system and an analytics tool (like New Relic mentioned in the project description) to pinpoint and troubleshoot the issue.

Here's a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate this flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Logging System" as Log
participant "Analytics Tool" as Analytics
participant "Data Store" as Data

Developer -> Log: Request logs for issue
alt logs available
    Log -> Developer: Provide logs
else logs not available
    Log -> Developer: Log request error
    Developer -> Analytics: Request data analytics
    Analytics -> Developer: Provide analytics dashboard
    Developer -> Analytics: Drill down to issue specifics
    Analytics -> Data: Query related data
    Data -> Analytics: Return data
    Analytics -> Developer: Display issue details
end

Developer -> Data: Request detailed data
Data -> Developer: Provide detailed data
Developer -> Developer: Analyze data to identify issue
Developer -> Data: Apply temporary data patch

alt issue resolved
    Developer -> Log: Log issue resolution
else further investigation required
    Developer -> Log: Log continuation of investigation
end

This sequence diagram outlines a path where:
- The Developer first requests logs related to an issue from the Logging System.
- If logs are available, they are provided. If not, an error is issued, and the Developer then approaches an Analytics Tool to get a dashboard overview.
- Depending on the availability and necessity, the Developer might need to drill down further into specifics, querying the Data Store via the Analytics Tool for more detailed data.
- After receiving detailed data, the Developer analyzes it to identify the issue.
- A temporary data patch may be applied by the Developer to the Data Store.
- Depending on whether the issue is resolved or not, the Developer logs the resolution or the need for continued investigation back in the Logging â€˜System.

This sequence can be tailored with more specifics related to the Broker application data access mechanisms, tools, and protocols used within your organization's infrastructure.

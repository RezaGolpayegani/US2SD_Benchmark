Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story of a manager wanting to manage primary operations through the Restaurant Management and Operations System involves illustrating how various system components and actors interact over time. Since the narrative involves a broad spectrum of functionalities (e.g., financial operations tracking, menu and order management, inventory, etc.), we'll focus on a generalized view that encapsulates main interactions. For a comprehensive sequence diagram, focusing on a specific scenario (like managing inventory or analyzing sales reports) would be necessary due to the complexity and breadth of operations in a restaurant.

For the sake of simplicity and focus, I'll draft a sequence diagram that encapsulates a general view of the manager interacting with the system to review daily sales, inventory levels, and update the menu, which are key operations for a manager.

Below is a sample sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This code assumes you are familiar with installing and running PlantUML. The diagram illustrates a simplified sequence where a manager logs in to the system, reviews reports, checks inventory, and updates the menu.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as mgr
participant "Login Interface" as login
participant "Dashboard" as dash
participant "Report Module" as report
participant "Inventory Module" as inventory
participant "Menu Management" as menu
database "System Database" as db

mgr -> login: Enter credentials
login -> db: Validate login
db -> login: Authentication Success
login -> dash: Display Dashboard
mgr -> dash: Select Reports
dash -> report: Retrieve Sales and Performance Reports
report -> db: Query Sales Data
db -> report: Return Sales Data
report -> mgr: Display Reports
mgr -> dash: Check Inventory
dash -> inventory: View Inventory Levels
inventory -> db: Query Inventory Data
db -> inventory: Return Inventory Info
inventory -> mgr: Display Inventory Levels
mgr -> inventory: Request Update Menu
inventory -> menu: Initiate Menu Update
menu -> db: Update Menu Items
db -> menu: Confirm Update
menu -> mgr: Update Successful

### How to Use This Code

1. **Install PlantUML**: Ensure you have PlantUML installed on your environment. It can be run as a standalone tool, integrated into various IDEs, or used online via web services like PlantText.com.

2. **Run the Diagram**: Copy the provided PlantUML code into your PlantUML editor or tool of choice and generate the diagram. This will visualize the sequence of interactions based on the provided scenario.

3. **Customize as Needed**: The provided sequence is a template based on a generalized overview. To align with specific project needs or dive into detailed functionalities (such as more detailed inventory management or financial operations), you should extend or modify the interactions and components.

Remember, sequence diagrams are most valuable when they focus on a specific interaction or process flow. For comprehensive software like a Restaurant Management and Operations System, you might need several diagrams to cover all critical features adequately.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between the Older Person (user), the ALFRED system, and potentially other systems (like a contact management system in the phone) that are involved in managing a contact list. Given the comprehensive nature of ALFRED as described, we'll assume it has the capability to interact directly with the phone's contacts application through a series of voice commands and possibly through a connected app or API.

Since the response format here doesn't support direct visualization or graphics, I'll write out the PlantUML code needed to create the sequence diagram. This code can then be copied and pasted into a PlantUML processor or viewer to generate the visual sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson as person
participant "ALFRED" as alfred
participant "Phone Contact Application" as phone

== Add a New Contact ==
person -> alfred : Says "Add a new contact"
activate alfred
alfred -> alfred : Processes voice command
alfred -> phone : Sends command to add contact
activate phone
phone -> phone : Opens contact addition form
phone --> alfred : Confirms form is open
deactivate phone
alfred --> person : Asks for contact details
activate person
person -> alfred : Provides contact details\n(Name, Number, etc.)
activate alfred
alfred -> phone : Sends contact details
activate phone
phone -> phone : Creates new contact
phone --> alfred : Confirms contact is saved
deactivate phone
alfred --> person : Confirms contact saved
deactivate alfred
deactivate person

== Update a Contact ==
person -> alfred : Says "Update contact [Name]"
activate alfred
alfred -> alfred : Processes voice command
alfred -> phone : Requests contact details for [Name]
activate phone
phone -> phone : Retrieves contact details
phone --> alfred : Displays contact details
deactivate phone
alfred --> person : Reads out contact details\nAsks for changes
activate person
person -> alfred : Provides updated details
activate alfred
alfred -> phone : Sends updated details
activate phone
phone -> phone : Updates contact
phone --> alfred : Confirms contact updated
deactivate phone
alfred --> person : Confirms contact updated
deactivate alfred
deactivate person

== Delete a Contact ==
person -> alfred : Says "Delete contact [Name]"
activate alfred
alfred -> alfred : Processes voice command
alfred -> phone : Sends command to delete [Name]
activate phone
phone -> phone : Deletes contact
phone --> alfred : Confirms contact deleted
deactivate phone
alfred --> person : Confirms contact deleted
deactivate alfred
deactivate person

This code snippet outlines the primary interactions involved in adding, updating, and deleting a contact via ALFRED, based on a user's voice commands. It assumes that ALFRED is capable of interpreting these commands, interacting with the phone's contact application to perform the required actions, and confirming the outcomes back to the user.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a staff, I want to add book checkouts to the system," requires several participants such as the Staff member interface, Checkout Management System, and Database.

Given the details of your project, let's draft a PlantUML code that represents this sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant StaffMemberInterface
participant CheckoutManagementSystem
participant Database

alt Book Checkout Process
    StaffMemberInterface -> CheckoutManagementSystem : initiateBookCheckout(borrowerId, bookId)
    activate CheckoutManagementSystem

    CheckoutManagementMSystem -> Database : verifyBookAvailability(bookId)
    activate Database
    Database --> CheckoutManagementSystem : bookAvailable=true
    deactivate Database

    CheckoutManagementSystem -> Database : checkBorrowerStatus(borrowerId)
    Database --> CheckoutManagementSystem : borrowerStatus=active
    deactivate Database

    CheckoutManagementSystem -> Database : createCheckoutRecord(borrowerId, bookId)
    Database --> CheckoutBorrowerManagementSystem : checkoutRecordCreated
    deactivate Database

    CheckoutManagementSystem --> StaffMemberInterface : displayCheckoutSuccess()
    deactivate CheckoutScript
    
else Book Not Available or Borrower Inactive
    CheckoutManagementSystem -> StaffMemberInterface : displayError(message)
    deactivate CheckoutManagementSystem
end

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram begins with the `StaffMemberInterface` initiating a book checkout process by sending a borrower ID and a book ID to the `CheckoutManagementEndSystem`. The system, then verifies the availability of the book and the status of the borrower's account by querying the `Database`. If the book is available and the borrower is active, the checkout record is created in the database, and a success message is displayed to the staff member through the `StaffMemberInterface`. In case the book is not available or the borrower is not active, an error message is displayed instead.

Please note this is a simplified view focusing on the core interactions for this user story. Depending on your specific requirements or additional functionalities of CLMS, you might need to include more details or other system components in the sequence diagram.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As an archivist, I want to restrict a file from view" involves breaking down the interactions between various system components and actors to implement the access restriction controls feature. The implementation detail may differ based on specific technologies used in the project, but the high-level interaction can be summarized as follows.

Given your request, here's a conceptual Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format. It outlines the process an archivist would follow to restrict a file from view within a digital archive management system:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Archivist as A
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Authorization Service" as Auth
participant "Database" as DB
participant "FileManagementSystem" as FMS

A -> W : Requests to restrict file
W -> Auth : Validate Archivist credentials
Auth --> W : Credentials valid
W -> W : Display restriction options form
A -> W : Submits restriction details
W -> DB : Update file metadata with restriction details
DB --> W : Confirmation of metadata update
W -> FMS : Apply access restrictions
FMS --> W : Confirmation of restriction application
W --> A : Display success message

This sequence diagram starts with the Archivist requesting to restrict a file's viewability via the Web Interface. The system then goes through a series of steps, including:

1. **Archivist Requests to Restrict File**: The archivist initiates the process through the web interface of the digital archive management system.
   
2. **Validate Archivist Credentials**: The system validates the archivist's credentials using an Authorization Service to ensure that the requestor has the necessary permissions to modify file access restrictions.

3. **Display Restriction Options Form**: Once validated, the system displays a form to the archivist, allowing them to specify the details of the file restriction (e.g., which file, nature of restriction, duration if applicable).

4. **Submits Restriction Details**: The archivist fills in and submits the restriction details through the web interface.

5. **Update File Metadata with Restriction Details**: The Web Interface communicates with the Database to update the metadata of the concerned file with the specified restriction details.

6. **Apply Access Restrictions**: Finally, the FileManagementSystem applies the specified restrictions to the file, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented according to the updated metadata.

7. **Display Success Message**: Upon successful application of the restrictions, the archivist is informed via a success message displayed by the Web Interface.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions and components involved when an archivist wants to restrict a file from view within a digital archive management system. Depending on the complexity of the system and the specific requirements, more details and steps could be added.

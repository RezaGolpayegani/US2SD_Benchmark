Creating a sequence diagram that outlines the process of generating high-level strategy recommendations for an NSF employee in conjunction with the new CMS can be detailed and involve several actors and systems. Given the complexity and the need to cover user research, collaboration, and technical development, the diagram below attempts to capture these phases using PlantUML syntax.

This example does not cover every potential detail but provides a structure that reflects key steps outlined in the project description, focusing on the interactions that might lead to the creation and delivery of high-level strategy recommendations for CMS implementation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor NSF_Employee as Employee
participant "User Research Team" as URT
participant "Technical Team" as TT
participant "CMS System" as CMS
participant "Documentation" as Docs

== Initiation ==
Employee -> URT: Request for CMS Strategy
URT -> URT: Define research objectives
URT -> TT: Communicate research needs for CMS

== User Research and Testing ==
loop User Testing
    URT -> CMS: Conduct usability testing
    CMS -> URT: Provide feedback data
end

== Analysis and Strategy Development ==
URT -> URT: Analyze user data
URT -> TT: Recommend CMS features based on analysis
TT -> TT: Evaluate technical feasibility
TT -> URT: Present technical constraints

== Strategy Finalization ==
URT -> URT: Adjust recommendations based on technical input
URT -> Docs: Document high-level CMS strategy
Docs -> Docs: Create training materials

== Communication ==
Docs -> Employee: Provide CMS strategy documentation
Employee -> Employee: Review documentation
Employee -> URT: Request clarification (if needed)
URT -> Employee: Provide additional details

== Implementation ==
Employee -> TT: Initiate CMS implementation based on strategy
TT -> CMS: Configure CMS according to strategy
CMS -> TT: Confirm completion
TT -> Employee: Notify CMS setup completion

This sequence diagram starts with the NSF employee's request and follows through user research, technical feasibility assessment, finalization of the strategy, documentation, and ends with the communication of the strategy and the beginning of its implementation. Key steps include:

1. **Defining research objectives and communicating needs**: Initial steps involve the employee asking for strategy recommendations, leading to the user research team defining their research objectives and communicating these needs to the technical team.

2 than and documenting high-level strategy**: The user research team analyzes data, works with the technical team to finalize recommendations, and documents the strategy, creating relevant training material.

3. **Communication and implementation**: The strategy is communicated back to the NSF employee, who reviews it and starts the CMS implementation process based on the provided recommendations.

This diagram is a simplified representation and might need adjustments and additional details based on the specific requirements of the NSF's project and the chosen CMS system's capabilities.

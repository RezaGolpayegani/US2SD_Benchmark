Given the complexity and the specific nature of the request, I'll provide a general approach to creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that captures the user story of a repository support team member wanting to export a set of records and associated files, manipulate the dataset, and then reload it into the system due to a uniform error in a collection. 

Please note, this sequence diagram is a high-level abstraction and might need adjustments based on the specific technical implementations and interactions of Cornell University's repository system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SupportTeamMember as STM
participant "Export Service" as Export
database "Digital Repository" as Repo
participant "Manipulation Tool" as Manipulate
participant "Import Service" as Import

STM -> Export: Request export of dataset
activate Export

Export -> Repo: Extract records & files
activate Repo
Repo -->> Export: Dataset
deactivate Repo

Export -->> STM: Dataset
deactivate Export

STM -> Manipulate: Load dataset
activate Manipulate
STM -> Manipulate: Correct uniform error
Manipulate -->> STM: Corrected dataset
deactivate Manipulate

STM -> Import: Request import of dataset
activate Import
Import -> Repo: Validate dataset format
activate Repo
Repo -->> Import: Validation success
deactivate Repo

Import -> Repo: Update records & files
activate Repo
Repo -->> Import: Update success
deactivate Repo

Import -->> STM: Import success confirmation
deactivate Import

**Explanation:**

1. **SupportTeamMember (STM) to Export Service**: The sequence begins with the support team member requesting the export of a dataset, which includes records and associated files from the digital repository system.

2. **Export Service to Digital Repository**: The Export Service then interacts with the Digital Repository to extract the requested records and files.

3. **Digital Repository to Export Service**: The Digital Repository sends the dataset to the Export Service.

4. **Export Service to SupportTeamMember**: The Export Service delivers the dataset to the support team member.

5. **SupportTeamMember to Manipulation Tool**: The support team member then loads the dataset into some form of a manipulation tool to correct the uniform errors present in the collection.

6. **Manipulation Tool to SupportTeamMember**: After the corrections are made, the manipulation tool outputs the corrected dataset back to the support team member.

7. **SupportTeamMember to Import Service**: With the corrected dataset, the support team member requests the Import Service to reload the dataset into the system.

8. **Import Service to Digital Repository (Validation)**: The Import Service first validates the corrected dataset format against the Digital Repository's requirements to ensure compatibility.

9. **Import Service to Digital Repository (Update)**: Upon successful validation, the Import Service then proceeds to update the existing records and files with the corrected dataset in the Digital Repository.

10. **Import Service to SupportTeamMember**: Finally, the Import Service confirms the successful import of the corrected dataset back to the support team member.

This sequence diagram reflects a simplified overview of the process a repository support team member would follow to export, manipulate, and then reload a set of records and associated files into Cornell University's digital repository system to correct uniform errors in a collection. Depending on the actual implementation details, additional steps or systems could be involved in the process.

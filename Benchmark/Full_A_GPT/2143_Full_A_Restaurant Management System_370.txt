Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As an employee, I want to see the customer orders," involves illustrating the interactions between the employee, the system, and the database.
Here is a PlantUML code that represents the Sequence Diagram for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as emp
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Server" as S
database "Database" as DB

emp -> UI : Request to view orders
UI -> S : Get customer orders
S -> DB : Query orders
DB --> S : Return orders
S --> UI : Display customer orders
UI --> emp : Show orders
@endge
```

This diagram begins with the `Employee` requesting to view customer orders through the `User Interface (UI)`. The UI sends this request to the `Server`, which then queries the `Database` for the orders. The Database returns the orders to the Server, which passes the information back to the UI, and finally, the UI displays the orders to the Employee.

### Explanation of Each Step:
1. **Employee Requests to View Orders**: The sequence starts with the employee requesting to see the customer orders, which is done through the user interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **UI Requests Orders from Server**: The UI then sends a request to the server to fetch the customer orders. This interaction signals the system to retrieve the specific data requested by the employee.

3. **Server Queries the Database**: Upon receiving the request from the UI, the Server processes it and queries the Database for the requested customer orders. This step is crucial as it involves fetching the required information from the stored data.

4. **Database Returns Orders**: The Database processes the Server's query and returns the list of customer orders back to the Server. This interaction completes the data retrieval process.

5. **Server Sends Orders to UI**: With the customer orders retrieved from the Database, the Server sends this information back to the UI. This step involves preparing and transmitting the data in a format that the UI can display.

6. **UI Displays Orders to Employee**: Finally, the UI processes the information received from the Server and displays the customer orders to the Employee. This step completes the sequence by fulfilling the employee's initial request to see the customer orders.

This sequence diagram focuses on the back-and-forth interactions between the employee, the UI, the server, and the database, central to fulfilling the user story of an employee wishing to see customer orders within the context of a Restaurant Management and Operations System.

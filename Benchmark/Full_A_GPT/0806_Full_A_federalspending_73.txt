Given the complexity and multifaceted nature of the Comprehensive Broker Platform Enhancement Project, the following sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrates a simplified process interaction focusing specifically on an agency user wanting to accurately see who created a submission and who last updated it. This feature involves interactions between the agency user, the Broker platform's UI, the backend system, and the database where submission data, including creator and updater information, is stored.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Agency User" as user
participant "Broker UI" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Broker Database" as db

user -> ui : Navigate to submission details
ui -> backend : Request submission info
backend -> db : Query creator and last updater info
db -> backend : Return submission data
backend -> ui : Show submission creator and last updater
ui -> user : Display submission details

note over user, db : The process ensures\nthe agency user can see\naccurate details about\nsubmission creators and updaters.
@enduml
```

This diagram represents a flow where:
1. **Agency User** navigates to the submission details page on the Broker UI.
2. The **Broker UI** requests submission information from the **Backend System**.
3. The **Backend System** queries the **Broker Database** for the creator and the last updater information related to the submission.
4. The **Broker Database** returns the required submission data to the **Backend System**.
5. The **Backend System** then processes the information and instructs the **Broker UI** to display the submission details, including information about who created the submission and who last updated it.
6. Finally, the **Broker UI** presents this information to the **Agency User**, completing the interaction flow.

This sequence ensures that the agency user receives accurate and up-to-date information about the submission creators and updaters, aligning with the project's objective to enhance data integrity and user experience on the Broker platform.

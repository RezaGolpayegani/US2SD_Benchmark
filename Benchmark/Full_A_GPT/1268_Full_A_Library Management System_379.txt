Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to calculate fines for overdue books" involves illustrating the series of interactions among different system components in the context of this specific process. Below is a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the steps involved in calculating fines for overdue books within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

This sequence diagram starts with the librarian logging into the CLMS and continues through the process of calculating fines for overdue books. The steps include:

1. **Librarian Logs In:** The librarian logs into the system, initiating the sequence.
2. **System Validates Credentials:** The system communicates with the database to validate the librarian's credentials.
3. **Display Dashboard:** Once validated, the system displays the dashboard to the librarian.
4. **Request Overdue Books List:** The librarian requests a list of overdue books.
5. **Retrieve Overdue Books Information:** The system retrieves the information about overdue books from the database.
6. **Display Overdue Books List:** The overdue books list is displayed to the librarian.
7. **Select Overdue Book for Fine Calculation:** The librarian selects an overdue book to calculate the fine.
8. **Retrieve Book Return and Current Dates:** The system retrieves the book's return date and the current date.
9. **Calculate Fine:** The system calculates the fine based on the overdue duration.
10. **Display Calculated Fine:** The calculated fine is displayed to the librarian.
11. **Confirm Fine Calculation:** The librarian confirms the fine calculation for the book.
12. **Update Book Record with Fine:** The system updates the book record in the database with the fine details.
13. **Display Confirmation Message:** A confirmation message is displayed to the librarian.

This diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions between the librarian, the library system, and the database during the fine calculation process.

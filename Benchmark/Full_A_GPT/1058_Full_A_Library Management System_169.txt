To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a library member, I want to preserve a book," we need to outline the steps involved in the reservation process from the perspective of the system, the library member, and other components that interact during the reservation process.

The following sequence diagram depicts how a library member can reserve a book through the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This involves interaction with the system's interface, checking the book's availability, and then processing the reservation.

Please note, to render this PlantUML diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor or an appropriate plugin available in many IDEs or online editors.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

actor Member as M
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Reservation System" as RS
database "CLMS Database" as DB
participant "Notification System" as NS

== Reserve a Book ==

M -> W : Search for book
W -> RS : Request book availability
RS -> DB : Query book status
DB --> RS : Return book status
RS --> W : Show book availability/status
W --> M : Display book status

alt If book is available for reservation
    M -> W : Request to reserve book
    W -> RS : Process reservation
    RS -> DB : Update book status\n(Set as reserved)
    DB --> RS : Confirm update
    RS -> NS : Send reservation confirmation
    NS -> M : Email/SMS confirmation to Member
else If book is not available
    W --> M : Inform book is unavailable
end

This sequence shows the following steps:
1. The member searches for a book using the system's web interface.
2. The web interface requests the book's availability from the reservation system.
3. The reservation system queries the CLMS database for the book's status.
4. The database returns the book's status to the reservation system.
5. The reservation system then provides the book's availability status to the web interface, which is shown to the member.
6. If the book is available for reservation:
    a. The member requests to reserve the book.
    b. The web interface processes this request with the reservation system.
    c. The reservation system updates the book's status in the database as reserved and confirms the update.
    d. The reservation system instructs the notification system to send a reservation confirmation to the member via email or SMS.
7. If the book is not available, the member is informed about its unavailability directly through the web interface.

This diagram is a high-level overview and assumes basic interactions. Depending on specifics like error handling, member authentication, and system architecture, the actual implementation can be more complex.

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story, first, it's essential to break down the main steps that a UI Designer might take to move on to the third round of Help page edits and secure approvals from leadership. This sequence will typically involve multiple interactions between the UI Designer, the Help Page content, the Review Team, and possibly a Version Control System if the project is using one.

Below is a simple PlantUML code snippet that captures these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor UI_Designer as "UI Designer"
entity Review_Team as "Review Team"
database Version_Control as "Version Control System"
control Leadership as "Leadership"

== Round 2 Review ==
UI_Designer -> Version_Control : Commit round 2 edits
Version_Control -> Review_Team : Notify of new edits
Review_Team -> Review_Team : Review edits
Review_Team -> UI_Designer : Provide feedback

== Prepare for Round 3 ==
UI_Designer -> UI_Designer : Incorporate feedback
UI_Designer -> Version_Control : Commit round 3 edits for review

== Round 3 Review ==
Version_Control -> Review_Team : Notify of round 3 edits
Review_Team -> Review_Team : Review round 3 edits
Review_Team -> UI_Designer : Approve edits / Request changes

alt Edits Approved
    Review_Team -> Leadership : Submit for final approval
    Leadership -> Leadership : Review edits
    Leadership -> UI_Designer : Provide final approval
else More Changes Requested
    Review_Team -> UI_Designer : Request additional changes
    UI_Designer -> UI_Designer : Make changes
end

This sequence diagram starts with the completion of round 2 edits, followed by the submission and review process leading up to the submission for the third round. Depending on the outcome of the review, it might necessitate further changes or lead to final approval by leadership.

- **Commit round 2 edits:** Represents the UI Designer updating the Help page for the second round of edits and submitting these changes to a Version Control System.
- **Notify of new edits:** The Version Control System automatically notifies the Review Team of the new edits.
- **Review edits:** The Review Team reviews the changes.
- **Provide feedback:** Feedback is given to the UI Designer.
- **Incorporate feedback and Commit round 3 edits for review:** The UI Designer adjusts the design based on feedback and prepares for the third round.
- **Approval Workflow:** The Review Team approves the round 3 edits, which are then submitted to Leadership for final approval.

This diagram can be expanded or modified based on the specifics of your project's review and approval process, including more detailed interactions with other systems or more granular steps in the feedback and approval cycle.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a user wants to modify or branch an experimental protocol, while retaining the original, involves depicting the interactions between the user, the Neurohub platform interface, and potentially other backend services involved in this process. This sequence will visually represent the steps taken from the point the user decides to modify a protocol, through the actions carried out by the system, to the eventual creation of a branched or modified protocol.

Given the complexity and the abstract nature of your project's backend, the sequence might not cover all possible technical aspects or system components. For instance, specific database management systems (DBMS), authentication services, or data validation processes are abstracted into broader system interactions for clarity.

Below is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram representing this user story:

```
@startuml
actor User as U
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Protocol Management" as PM
participant "Database" as DB
database "Version Control" as VC

== Modify or Branch Experimental Protocol ==

U -> UI: Selects protocol to modify
UI -> PM: Request protocol detail
PM -> DB: Fetch protocol data
DB --> PM: Protocol data
PM --> UI: Display protocol data
U -> UI: Chooses to branch or modify protocol
UI -> PM: Request branch/modify action with details
activate PM
    PM -> VC: Check out protocol for branching/modification
    VC --> PM: Provide protocol copy
    PM -> PM: Create new protocol version/branch
    PM -> DB: Save new protocol version/branch
    DB --> PM: Confirm save
    PM --> UI: Display success message
deactivate PM
UI --> U: Confirmation & details of new protocol version/branch

### Explanation of Diagram Components:
- **User (U):** Initiates the process by selecting a protocol and deciding to either modify it or create a branch.
- **User Interface (UI):** The frontend through which the user interacts with Neurohub. It captures user inputs and displays information.
- **Protocol Management (PM):** A backend component responsible for handling protocol-related operations, including branching and modifications.
- **Database (DB):** Stores all data related to protocols, including versions and branches.
- **Version Control (VC):** Manages different versions or branches of protocols, ensuring that changes are tracked and that the original protocol is preserved.

### Key Interactions:
1. **Protocol Selection and Retrieval:** The user selects a protocol to modify, and the system retrieves the details for review.
2. **Decision to Branch or Modify:** Based on the user's choice, the system prepares to either branch off a new version of the protocol or modify the existing one.
3. **Branching/Modifying Protocol:** The system handles the creation of a new protocol version or branch, ensuring changes do not affect the original.
4. **Saving Changes:** The new or modified protocol is saved in the database, with version control handling the management of versions or branches.
5. **Confirmation:** The user is notified of the successful creation of a new protocol version or branch.

This sequence diagram is a high-level overview. Implementing this feature would require detailed design considerations concerning data integrity, user permissions, version control methodologies, and interface design, none of which are deeply explored in this abstract representation.

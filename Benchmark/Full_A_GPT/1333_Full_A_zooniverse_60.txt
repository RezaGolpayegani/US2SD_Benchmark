Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As an admin, I want to see a summary of articles, so that I reuse them" within the context of the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) involves outlining the interactions between the system's components to fulfill this requirement. Here is a PlantUML code representation of how this process could be visualized:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Article Summarization Service" as Summarization
participant "Database" as DB

Admin -> UI: Request article summaries
UI -> CMS: Fetch articles for summarization
CMS -> DB: Retrieve articles
DB --> CMS: Articles
CMS -> Summarization: Send articles for summarization
Summarization -> Summarization: Process articles to generate summaries
Summarization --> CMS: Article summaries
CMS --> UI: Display article summaries
UI --> Admin: Show summaries to admin
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified interaction flow around the admin's desire to see summaries of articles for potential reuse within the AMIDD platform:

1. **Admin Initiates Request**: The process begins when the admin requests to see summaries of articles through the web interface.
2. **Web Interface to CMS**: The request is then passed on to the Content Management System (CMS), which is responsible for handling content-related operations.
3. **CMS Retrieves Articles**: The CMS fetches the required articles from the database, initiating a query to retrieve the articles that need summarization.
4. **Database Response**: The database returns the articles to the CMS.
5. **CMS to Article Summarization Service**: The CMS then forwards these articles to the Article Summarization Service, a component specifically designed to generate concise summaries of articles.
6. **Summarization Process**: The Article Summarization Service processes the articles, applying algorithms to condense the content into summary form while retaining essential information.
7. **Summaries to CMS**: Once the summaries are ready, they are sent back to the CMS.
8. **CMS to Web Interface**: The CMS forwards the summaries to the web interface.
9. **Admin Views Summaries**: Finally, the web interface displays the article summaries to the admin, completing the request.

This diagram is a high-level depiction and can be further detailed based on specific implementation decisions, such as the methodology for summarizing articles, the database schema, or how the web interface interacts with other components of the AMIDP ecosystem.

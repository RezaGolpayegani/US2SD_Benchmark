Given your request to create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of an external collaborator seeking privileged access to data for collaboration, below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that captures this process. This script includes interactions between the external collaborator, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform's web interface, the authentication service, project manager, and the data archive system.

Please note, the sequence diagram outlines a simplified view of the interactions and might need adjustments based on the detailed system design and authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, SAML) in use at your institution.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Ext_Collaborator as "External Collaborator"
participant Web_Interface as "Web Interface"
participant Auth_Service as "Authentication Service"
participant Proj_Manager as "Project Manager"
participant Data_Archive as "Data Archive System"

actor Ext_Collaborator

activate Ext_Collaborator
Ext_Collaborator -> Web_Interface : Request access to project data
activate Web_Interface

Web_Interface -> Auth_Service : Validate collaborator
activate Auth_Service
Auth_Service -> Auth_Service : Authenticate credentials
Auth_Service -> Web_Interface : Authentication success
deactivate Auth_Service

Web_Interface -> Proj_Manager : Verify involvement in project
activate Proj_Manager
Proj_Manager -> Proj_Manager : Check project membership
Proj_Manager -> Web_Interface : Verification success
deactivate Proj_Manager

Web_Interface -> Data_Archive : Request privileged access to data
activate Data_Archive
Data_Archive -> Data_Archive : Apply access controls
Data_Archive --> Ext_Collaborator : Grant access to data
deactivate Data_Archive
deactivate Web_Interface

This sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:
1. The external collaborator requests access to project data through the web interface.
2. The web interface requests the authentication service to validate the collaborator.
3. The authentication service authenticates the collaborator's credentials and returns a success message.
4. The web interface then verifies the collaborator's involvement in the project with the project manager.
5. Upon successful verification, the web interface requests privileged access to data from the data archive system.
6. The data archive system applies the necessary access controls and grants access to the collaborator.

Be aware that this diagram assumes a general flow and might need tailoring to fit specific protocols or detailed workflows of your platform, particularly around authentication and project membership verification.

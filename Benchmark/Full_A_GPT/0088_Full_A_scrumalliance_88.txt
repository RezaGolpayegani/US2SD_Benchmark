Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story outlined requires breaking down the interaction process between different actors and the system components involved in paying a corporate membership fee on the Scrum Alliance Community Platform. Here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that captures these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Company Representative" as cr
participant "Scrum Alliance Platform" as platform
participant "Membership Management System" as mms
participant "Payment Gateway" as pg
participant "Corporate Sponsorship Database" as csdb

cr -> platform: Access Corporate Membership Section
platform -> mms: Display Membership Options
mms --> cr: Show Membership Fees & Benefits

cr -> mms: Select Corporate Membership Plan
mms -> cr: Request Company Details
cr -> mms: Provide Company Details
mms -> cr: Request Payment

cr -> pg: Initiate Payment Process
pg -> cr: Enter Payment Details
cr -> pg: Submit Payment Details
pg -> pg: Validate Payment Information
pg -> mms: Confirm Payment

mms -> csdb: Register Company as Corporate Member
csdb -> mms: Generate Membership Confirmation
mms --> cr: Display Membership Confirmation & Benefits

This sequence diagram outlines the process starting from when a company representative accesses the corporate membership section of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform. It then follows the steps taken to select a membership plan, provide Company Details, initiate and complete the payment process through a Payment Gateway, and finally, the system's process for confirming and registering the company as a corporate member, displaying a confirmation of membership and associated benefits back to the user.

Please note that modifications and detailing could be added based on specific project requirements, such as handling payment failures, validating company details, or issuing membership numbers.

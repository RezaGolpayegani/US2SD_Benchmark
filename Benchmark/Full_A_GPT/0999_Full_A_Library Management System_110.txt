Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: *"As a librarian, I want to view the publish dates of the books."* This illustrates the sequence of events that occur when a librarian queries the system to view the publication dates of books.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "UI Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Library Management System" as LMS
participant "Database" as DB

== View Publication Dates of Books ==

Librarian -> Dashboard: Requests to view publish dates of books
Dashboard -> LMS: Fetch publish dates request
activate LMS
LMS -> DB: Query for publish dates of books
activate DB
DB --> LMS: Publish dates data
deactivate DB
LMS --> Dashboard: Display publish dates
Dashboard --> Librarian: Shows publish dates
deactivate LMS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. **Initiation:** The librarian requests to view the publish dates of books via the UI Dashboard.
2. **Request Handling:** The Dashboard forwards this request to the Library Management System (LMS).
3. **Query Processing:** LMS then queries the Database for the publication dates of the books.
4. **Data Retrieval:** The Database processes this query and returns the publication dates data back to the LMS.
5. **Result Display:** LMS processes the data, forwards it to the Dashboard, which in turn displays the publish dates to the librarian.

This visualization helps in understanding the interactions between different components of the system for fulfilling the librarian's request to view the publication dates of the books. Note that additional details or steps can be added depending on the complexity and specific requirements of the CLMS project.

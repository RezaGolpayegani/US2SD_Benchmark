To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided, we will focus on the interaction between a data manager and the DMPTool. This scenario involves the data manager querying the system for the time plan related to collecting data, and the system responding with the necessary information. We will also include interaction with the database where the plans are stored and possibly the interaction with a repository if the system fetches updated information dynamically.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager
participant "DMPTool" as DMP
database "Plan Database" as DB
participant "Repository" as Repo

== Data Manager Queries Time Plan for Data Collection ==

DataManager -> DMP: Request time plan for data collection
activate DMP

DMP -> DB: Query time plan for specific project
activate DB

DB -> DMP: Return time plan details
deactivate DB

DMP -> Repo: Request any updates on time plan 
activate Repo

Repo -> DMP: Return updated time plan details
deactivate Repo

DMP -> DataManager: Present compiled time plan for data collection
deactivate DMP

DataManager -> DMP: Acknowledge receipt and validity of time plan
activate DMP
DMP -> DataManager: Confirmation of successful operation

deactivate DMP

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Data Manager requesting the time plan for data collection from the DMPTool. The DMPTool then queries its Plan Database for the requested information. Assuming that the plan might have updates or additional data gathered from external sources like repositories, the DMPTool requests this from the Repository, too. Once the Repository provides any updates or confirms the current plan is up to date, the DMPTool compiles this information and presents it to the Data Manager. Finally, the Data Manager acknowledges the information, and the DMPTool confirms the successful operation.

Keep in mind, this is a simplified diagram aiming to present a clear flow of the given user story. Details like error handling, security considerations, and specific interactions with the database or repository systems that might be more complex in real implementations are not thoroughly represented in this basic scenario.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between the research participant and the various system components involved during the testing of a prototype in a usability study setting. Below is a PlantUML description that outlines these interactions focusing on ensuring that the prototype's appearance does not distract from the workflow, allowing the research participant to complete the user interview.

### Explanation:

- **Facilitator**: Represents the researcher or team member responsible for facilitating the usability testing session.

- **ResearchParticipant (RP)**: The user involved in the usability testing, whose feedback is crucial for understanding the prototype's effectiveness.

- **UI/UX Prototype**: The visual and functional representation of the NSF's beta site being tested. It interacts with the CMS for content and displays workflow features to the research participant.

- **UserResearchSystem (URS)**: A system or platform used to schedule usability sessions, gather feedback, and communicate with participants and facilitators.

- **CMS**: Content Management System used by the prototype to fetch and display content.

This sequence diagram focuses on ensuring the prototype's appearance is optimized to avoid distracting the participant, based on the feedback loop facilitated by the URS and the direct interaction between the Facilitator, the prototype, and the research participant. The feedback loop allows for adjustments to be made to the prototype in real-time or in iterative testing phases to minimize distractions and ensure the workflow is clear to the participant.

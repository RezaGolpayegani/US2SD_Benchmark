Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story requires describing the interactions between different system components and the user (in this case, a repository manager) to achieve the goal of indicating a specific role (e.g., illustrator, photographer) for a name associated with a collection, object, or object component within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS). Below is a basic example of how this could be represented in PlantUML syntax. This example assumes a simplified interaction flow and should be adapted to align with the specific architectures, technologies, and processes used within your DAMS.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as manager
participant "DIMS Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Authentication Service" as authService
participant "Role Management Component" as roleMan
participant "Database" as db

manager -> webInterface : Select collection/object/component
manager -> webInterface : Choose to edit roles

webInterface -> authService : Validate session
authService --> webInterface : Session Valid

webInterface -> roleMan : Request roles form
roleMan --> webInterface : Return roles form

webInterface -> manager : Display roles form
manager -> webInterface : Submit role assignment (e.g., illustrator)

webInterface -> roleMan : Process role assignment
roleMan -> db : Update role for name
db --> roleMan : Confirm update
roleMan --> webInterface : Confirm success

webInterface -> manager : Display success message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the repository manager selecting the collection, object, or component they wish to assign a role to and choosing to edit roles via the DIMS Web Interface. The system checks the session's validity through an authentication service before displaying the role assignment options to the manager. Upon receiving the role details (e.g., illustrator), the Role Management Component processes this assignment and updates the database accordingly. A success message is shown to the repository manager upon completion.

This sequence diagram is basic and might need to be expanded based on more specific requirements and system complexities, such as error handling, detailed interaction with external systems (if any), and more nuanced user permission checks.

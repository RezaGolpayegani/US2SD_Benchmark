Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves mapping out the interaction flow between the system actors (both human and system components) involved in reviewing code modifications submitted by an applicant. Given the complexity and the number of actors potentially involved, please note that this diagram aims to capture the essential steps of the process within the constraints of the project description. This will include the Plan Review Staff Member, the Application System, possibly a Database for storing project and code modification requests, and the Applicant for initiating requests and receiving feedback.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram code snippet that outlines the sequence of actions initiated by a Plan Review Staff Member (PRSM) wanting to review code modifications submitted by an Applicant and, if approved, associate them with the appropriate project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Applicant
participant "Application\nSystem" as AppSys
database "Project Database" as DB
actor "Plan Review\nStaff Member" as PRSM

== Code Modification Submission ==
Applicant -> AppSys : Submit Code Modification\nRequest with Documentation
activate AppSys
AppSys -> DB : Store Submission Details
activate DB
DB --> AppSys : Acknowledge Storage
deactivate DB
AppSys --> Applicant : Acknowledge\nSubmission Received
deactivate AppSys

== Code Review Process ==
PRSM -> AppSys : Fetch Pending\nCode Modifications
activate AppSys
AppSys -> DB : Retrieve Submission\nDetails & Documents
activate DB
DB --> AppSys : Submission Details &\nDocuments
deactivate DB
AppSys --> PRSM : Display Details &\nDocuments
deactivate AppSys
PRSM -> PRSM : Review Submitted\nCode Modifications
note right of PRSM: Review based on\napplicable standards\and project requirements

== Decision Making ==
alt If Code Modifications Approved
    PRSM -> AppSys : Approve Modifications\n& Associate with Project
    activate AppSys

    activate DB
    DB --> AppSys : Acknowledge Update
    deactivate DB

    PRSM -> Applicant : Request Further\nModifications with Feedback
else If Code Modifications Rejected
    PRSM -> Applicant : Notify Rejection\n& Reasons
end

### Explanation:
- The process begins with an **Applicant** submitting a code modification request through the **Application System**.
- The **Application System** stores the submission details in the **Project Database** and acknowledges the submission to the **Applicant**.
- When ready to review the submissions, the **Plan Review Staff Member** (PRSM) interacts with the **Application System** to fetch pending code modifications.
- The **Application System** retrieves the submission details and documents from the **Project Database** and presents them to the PRSM.
- The PRSM reviews the submitted code modifications based on applicable standards and project requirements.
- Depending on the outcome of the review:
    - If approved, the PRSM uses the **Application System** to update the project with the modifications, and both the system and the PRSM notify the applicant of the approval and any next steps.
    - If the modifications require further changes, the PRSM directly requests further modifications from the **Applicant** with feedback.
    - If the modifications are rejected, the PRSM notifies the **Applicant** of the rejection and provides reasons.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interaction between various components such as the user (AnonymousUser), the web interface, the backend server, and possibly other services like a database or external APIs for venue details. Hereâ€™s how this interaction might be captured in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AnonymousUser as user
participant WebInterface as web
participant BackendServer as server
database VenueDatabase as db

user -> web : Navigate to Venue Details
web -> server : Request Venue Information
server -> db : Query Venue Details
db -> server : Return Venue Details
server -> web : Display Venue Information
web -> user : Show Venue Details Page

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Steps:
1. **AnonymousUser to WebInterface:** The user navigates to the part of the website where venue details are displayed, initiating the process.
2. **WebInterface to BackendServer:** The web interface sends a request to the backend server to fetch the relevant venue information. This represents a call from the client side (e.g., through an AJAX request or a page load) to server-side logic.
3. **BackendServer to VenueDatabase:** The backend server processes this request and queries the VenueDatabase for details about the venue. This could involve SQL queries or calls to a No-SQL database, depending on how the data is stored.
4. **VenueDatabase to BackendServer:** The database returns the queried venue details to the backend server. This data might include the venue's name, location, capacity, available facilities, events scheduled, etc.
5. **BackendServer to WebInterface:** After receiving the venue details from the database, the backend server formats this data as needed (possibly into HTML, JSON, etc.) and sends it back to the web interface.
6. **WebInterface to AnonymousUser:** Finally, the web interface presents these details to the user in a readable and engaging format, completing the user's request to view venue details.

This sequence diagram outlines a basic flow and can be customized based on specific project requirements, such as adding error handling, user authentication steps (if eventually required for other actions), and interactions with other microservices or external APIs for maps and directions.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the communication process between different actors (the Rector, DMPTool, Data Managers, Repository Owners, IT Managers) and systems to fulfill the rector's request. We will assume the DMPTool already has integrated functionalities to interact with various stakeholders and their systems.

Here's a conceptual PlantUML sequence diagram for the said user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Rector
participant "DMPTool" as DMP
participant "Data Manager" as DataManager
participant "Repository Owner" as RepoOwner
participant "IT Manager" as ITManager
database "Storage Database" as StorageDB

Rector -> DMP: Requests data storage forecasts
activate DMP

DMP -> DataManager: Queries current and future data storage metrics
activate DataManager

DataManager -> StorageDB: Retrieves data metrics
activate StorageDB
StorageDB --> DataManager: Data metrics
deactivate StorageDB

DataManager --> DMP: Returns data metrics
deactivate DataManager

DMP -> RepoOwner: Requests repository capacity forecasts
activate RepoOwner

RepoOwner -> StorageDB: Retrieves capacity forecasts
activate StorageDB
StorageDB --> RepoOwner: Capacity details
deactivate StorageDB

RepoOwner --> DMP: Returns capacity forecasts
deactivate RepoOwner

DMP -> ITManager: Queries IT infrastructure and capacity plans
activate ITManager

ITManager -> StorageDB: Fetches IT resource projections
activate StorageDB
StorageDB --> ITManager: IT resource data
deactivate StorageDB

ITManager --> DMP: Returns IT capacity plans
deactivate ITManager

DMP --> Rector: Provides comprehensive data and storage report
deactivate DMP
@enduml
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rector Requests Data Storage Forecasts:** The sequence starts with the Rector asking the DMPTool for projections on how much data will be stored to plan long-term resources.

2. **Querying Current and Future Data Storage Metrics:** DMPTool requests information from Data Managers to gather current and future data storage metrics.

3. **Retrieving Data Metrics:** Data Managers access the Storage Database to fetch the required data metrics.

4. **Requesting Repository Capacity Forecasts:** DMPTool also inquires about repository capacity forecasts from Repository Owners.

5. **Fetching Capacity Forecasts:** Repository Owners retrieve this capacity information from the Storage Database.

6. **Querying IT Infrastructure and Capacity Plans:** To ensure that long-term resources are adequately planned, DMPTool asks IT Managers for their input on IT infrastructure and capacity plans.

7. **Fetching IT Resource Projections:** IT Managers access projections concerning IT resources from the Storage Database.

8. **Providing Comprehensive Data and Storage Report:** Finally, DMPTool consolidates all collected information and provides a comprehensive report to the Rector, aiding in the planning of long-term resources.

This sequence diagram serves as a high-level conceptual guide. Specific implementations may introduce further steps or streamline processes depending on system architecture, available APIs, and other integrations within the institution's technical environment.

To fulfill your request, Iâ€™ll provide you with a PlantUML code that illustrates a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the (){current available items in our inventory so that I can order necessary ones from suppliers.}." This sequence diagram will depict the interactions between the manager, the inventory management system, and potentially the supplier management system within the context of a Restaurant Management and Operations System.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as manager
participant "Inventory\nManagement System" as IMS
participant "Supplier\nManagement System" as SMS

manager -> IMS : Request current\ninventory data
activate IMS
IMS -> IMS : Retrieve inventory\ndetails
IMS --> manager : Display current\ninventory items
deactivate IMS

loop for each item with low stock
    manager -> IMS : Check item\nstock level
    activate IMS
    IMS --> manager : Display stock\nlevel
    deactivate IMS

    alt If stock is below threshold
        manager -> SMS : Initiate order\nfor item
        activate SMS
        SMS -> SMS : Process order\nrequest
        SMS --> manager : Confirm order\nstatus
        deactivate SMS
    else If stock is sufficient
        manager -> manager : Skip ordering\nprocess
    end
end

This code describes the process as following steps:
1. **Request Inventory Data**: The manager initiates a request to the Inventory Management System (IMS) to get the current details of the items available in stock.
2. **Retrieve and Display Data**: The IMS retrieves the information and returns the data to the manager, displaying the items currently in inventory.
3. **Check for Low Stock Items**: For each item, a check is made to determine if its stock level is below a certain threshold, indicating a low stock situation.
4. **Decide on Ordering**: 
    - If an item's stock is below the threshold, the manager moves to order the necessary stock from suppliers. This includes sending an order request to the Supplier Management System (SMS), which processes the request and confirms the order status back to the manager.
    - If the stock level is deemed sufficient, the manager skips the ordering process for that item.

This diagram assumes a simple flow where the manager interacts with the Inventory Management System to assess stock levels and then possibly with the Supplier Management System to place orders for low-stock items. It simplifies the interactions and does not include potential further nuances like authentication processes, detailed error handling, and complex decision-making processes based on predictive restocking algorithms, which might also be part of a real-life application.

Given the scope of the project description and the specific user story you've provided, creating a detailed sequence diagram involves focusing on interactions between the user, the system (AMIDP), and any external services (such as a geolocation service). Note that this approach simplifies some interactions to maintain clarity and focus on the key processes related to the request.

Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, illustrating the process from when a user wants to explore content based on geographical location to receiving recommendations for relevant videos.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Mobile App" as App
participant "AMIDP System" as System
participant "Geolocation Service" as GeoService
participant "Content Database" as Database

User -> App : Opens AMIDP app and requests content by location
App -> GeoService : Requests current geolocation
GeoService -> App : Returns geolocation
App -> System : Requests videos/content for current location
activate System
System -> Database : Queries for content by geolocation
activate Database
Database --> System : Returns list of relevant content
deactivate Database
System --> App : Sends content recommendations
deactivate System
App --> User : Displays recommended videos/content

```
This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **User Opens App and Requests Content:** The user interacts with the AMIDP mobile application and requests content based on their current location. 

2. **App Requests Current Geolocation:** The app makes a request to a geolocation service to obtain the current geographical coordinates of the user.

3. **Geolocation Service Returns Location:** The geolocation service provides the app with the user's current geographical location.

4. **App Requests Videos/Content for Location:** The app, with the user's location now known, requests from the AMIDP system any videos or other media content that is relevant to the user's current location.

5. **AMIDP System Queries Database:** The AMIDP system processes the request by querying its content database for any media related to the provided geographical coordinates.

6. **Database Returns List of Relevant Content:** The content database returns a list of media content that matches the geographical criteria to the AMIDD system.

7. **AMIDP System Sends Content Recommendations:** With the list of relevant content obtained, the AMIDP system then sends these content recommendations back to the mobile app.

8. **App Displays Recommended Videos/Content:** Finally, the AMIDP mobile app presents the recommended videos or other media content to the user based on their current location.

This sequence outlines the basic flow of interactions to achieve the goal described in your user story. The diagram assumes the AMIDP system is well-integrated with both a content database containing geo-tagged videos/content and a reliable geolocation service, facilitating the seamless discovery of location-based media.

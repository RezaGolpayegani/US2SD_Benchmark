Given the task at hand, here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that visualizes the scenario where a library staff member corrects errors in uploaded metadata and documents, with tracking of changes and reasons for revisions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff" as staff
participant "Web Interface" as web
database "Digital Repository" as repo
participant "Version Control System" as version
participant "Audit Logging System" as audit

== Correction Process ==
staff -> web: Log in
web -> repo: Verify credentials
repo --> web: Authentication successful
web --> staff: Display dashboard

staff -> web: Select document/metadata to edit
web -> repo: Retrieve document/metadata details
repo --> web: Display details
web --> staff: Show edit form 

staff -> web: Correct errors & submit reasons
web -> repo: Update document/metadata
repo --> web: Update successful

web -> version: Create new version of document/metadata
version --> web: Version tracking updated

web -> audit: Log changes with reasons
audit --> web: Logging successful

web --> staff: Display confirmation & changes log

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. **Log In**: The library staff member logs into the web interface, where the digital repository system verifies their credentials.
2. **Document/Metadata Selection**: The staff member selects the document or metadata they wish to edit, and the system retrieves the details for review.
3. **Error Correction and Reason Submission**: Upon reviewing the document or metadata, the staff member makes the necessary corrections and submits the reasons for these revisions.
4. **Document/Metadata Update**: The digital repository updates the document or metadata with the corrected information.
5. **Version Tracking**: The system creates a new version of the document or metadata to ensure that historical versions are preserved and accessible.
6. **Change Logging**: All changes, along with the reasons provided by the staff member, are logged in an audit system. This ensures transparency and allows for tracking reasons behind alterations.
7. **Confirmation and Log Display**: Finally, the staff member is shown a confirmation of the successful update along with the details of their logged changes.

This diagram provides a comprehensive view of the sequence of interactions that occur when a library staff member corrects errors in the content stored within Cornell University's digital repository system, ensuring accuracy and accountability.

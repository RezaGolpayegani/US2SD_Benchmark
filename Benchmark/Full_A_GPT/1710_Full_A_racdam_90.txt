Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story requires understanding the basic flow of actions an archivist might take to find files that cannot be made publicly available using a Digital Archive Management System. Below is a simplified representation in PlantUML format focused on this specific scenario.

Please note, the actual implementation can vary greatly depending on the specific architecture and technologies used in the project. The sequence diagram below is a high-level depiction.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "Digital Archive Interface" as DAI
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Access Control" as AC

A -> DAI: Request restricted files
activate DAI

DAI -> DB: Query for restricted files
activate DB
DB --> DAI: Return results
deactivate DB

DAI -> AC: Check access permissions
activate AC
AC --> DAI: Confirm permissions
deactivate AC

DAI -> A: Display restricted files
deactivate DAI
@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Diagram:**

1. **Archivist Request:** The sequence starts with the archivist (A) sending a request to the Digital Archive Interface (DAI) to find files that cannot be made publicly available.

2. **Query Database:** The Digital Archive Interface forwards the request to the Database (DB) to query for restricted files. This entails searching the database for files marked with restrictions or specific access controls.

3. **Return Results:** The Database processes the query and returns the results (list of restricted files) to the Digital Archive Interface.

4. **Check Access Permissions:** Before displaying the results, the Digital Archive Interface consults the Access Control (AC) system to ensure that the requesting archivist has the proper permissions to view the restricted files. This is a crucial step for maintaining security and compliance with access policies.

5. **Display Restricted Files:** Once the Access Control system confirms that the archivist has the appropriate permissions, the Digital Archive Interface displays the restricted files to the archivist.

This diagram provides a simplified view of the interactions involved in fulfilling the archivist's request to find digitized files that are not publicly available, depicting the roles of the digital archive interface, database, and access control in the process.

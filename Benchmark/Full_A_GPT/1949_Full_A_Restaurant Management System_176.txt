Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the employee list" involves visualizing the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System to fulfill the manager's request. Since detailed visualization can't be directly displayed here, I'll provide a Plant UML format sequence diagram code that reflects this scenario.

This sequence involves the manager, the web interface, the server application (including its business logic and database access layers), and the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Server Application" as SA
participant "Database" as DB

M -> W : Selects "Employee List"
W -> SA : Request to fetch employee list
activate SA
SA -> DB : Query employee data
activate DB
DB --> SA : Returns employee data
deactivate DB
SA --> W : Sends employee list data
deactivate SA
W --> M : Display employee list
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Manager (M)**: The user who wants to see the list of employees. This is where the sequence begins.
2. **Web Interface (W)**: Acts as the front-end where the manager interacts with the system. The manager selects or clicks on an option to view the employee list.
3. **Server Application (SA)**: This is the backend application that processes the request. It receives the command to fetch the employee list from the web interface.
4. **Database (DB)**: Where all employee data is stored. The server application queries the database to retrieve the employee list.

- The process kicks off when the manager selects the "Employee List" option in the web interface.
- The web interface then sends a request to the server application to fetch the employee list.
- The server application, upon receiving the request, queries the database for employee data.
- The database returns the employee data to the server application.
- The server application sends the employee list data back to the web interface.
- Finally, the web interface displays the employee list to the manager.

This sequence diagram outlines a basic interaction flow for viewing the employee list in the Restaurant Management and Operations System from the perspective of a manager.

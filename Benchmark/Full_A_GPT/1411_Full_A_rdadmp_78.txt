Given your request, I'll create a simple example of a PlantUML sequence diagram that captures the essence of the user story. Since the description of the DMPTool is quite rich, the actual implementation might involve more entities or interfaces; however, Iâ€™ll keep it to the basics for clarity. The scenario includes the faculty data steward accessing the DMPTool, navigating to view sections on responsibilities, and the system providing the necessary information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyDataSteward as steward
participant "DMPTool Interface" as interface
participant "Responsibilities Module" as responsibilities
database "Metadata Repository" as metadata

== Access DMPTool ==
steward -> interface: Navigate to DMPTool
activate interface

== View Responsibilities Section ==
steward -> interface: Request Responsibilities Section
activate responsibilities
interface -> responsibilities: Fetch Responsibilities Info
responsibilities -> metadata: Retrieve Responsibilities Data
metadata -> responsibilities: Responsibilities Data
responsibilities -> interface: Responsibilities Info
interface -> steward: Display Responsibilities Section

```

This sequence diagram breaks down the steps as follows:

1. **Access DMPTool**: The faculty data steward starts the interaction by navigating to the DMPTool.
2. **View Responsibilities Section**: The steward then requests to see the sections on responsibilities.
3. **Fetch Responsibilities Info**: The DMPTool interface calls on the Responsibilities Module to fetch the necessary information.
4. **Retrieve Responsibilities Data**: The Responsibilities Module queries the Metadata Repository to get the data related to responsibilities in data management.
5. **Display Responsibilities Section**: Finally, the steward is presented with the information through the DMPTool interface.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and could be expanded with more details depending on the complexities of interactions, such as authentication, error handling, and the dynamic creation or updating of responsibility sections.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story involves outlining the interactions between the user (researcher) and the system components involved in generating structured citation data. 

Given the scope of your project, we'll assume a system where researchers can search for files, view file details, and then generate citation data. Below is a simplified sequence diagram illustrating these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "File Database" as Database
participant "File Details Page" as Details
participant "Citation Generator" as Citation

Researcher -> Search : enters search query
Search -> Database : fetch files
Database -> Search : return files
Search -> Researcher : display files
Researcher -> Details : selects a file
Details -> Researcher : displays file details
Researcher -> Citation : requests citation data
Citation -> Database : retrieves file metadata
Database -> Citation : file metadata
Citation -> Citation : generate citation
Citation -> Researcher : display citation data

Explanation:

1. **Researcher enters search query**: The researcher uses the Search Interface to submit a query for finding a specific file or set of files.

2. **Search Interface fetches and displays files**: The search query is processed, fetching matching files from the File Database. The results are displayed back to the researcher.

3. **Researcher selects a file to view details**: From the list of search results, the researcher selects a file to view more details.

4. **File Details Page displays details**: The File Details Page presents detailed information about the file including title, author, date, etc.

5. **Researcher requests citation data**: With the necessary details visible, the researcher requests to generate structured citation data for the file.

6. **Citation Generator retrieves file metadata**: The request triggers the Citation Generator to retrieve specific metadata from the File Database needed for citation.

7. **Citation Generator generates and displays citation**: Using the retrieved metadata, the Citation Generator formats and generates the structured citation data according to a standard citation format and presents it to the researcher.

This sequence diagram simplifies the process focusing on the core interactions. Adjustments may be required based on the specific technologies, standards, or additional steps involved in your system.

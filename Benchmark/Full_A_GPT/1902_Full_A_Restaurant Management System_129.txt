To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specific user story "As a manager, I want to display orders by date" using PlantUML, we'll outline the interaction between the manager, the system interface, and the backend services that query the database for orders based on the specified date. This process involves the web interface through which the manager inputs the date, the system backend handling the request, and the database where order data is stored and retrieved.

Below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This diagram assumes a simple interaction flow where the manager inputs a date, the system queries the database, and then results are returned and displayed.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Backend Server" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> MI: Selects date and requests orders
activate MI
MI -> BS: GET /orders?date=2023-04-15
activate BS
BS -> DB: Query orders by date '2023-04-15'
activate DB
DB --> BS: Returns orders
deactivate DB
BS --> MI: Order details for 2023-04-15
deactivate BS
MI --> M: Displays orders
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Manager (M)**: This actor represents the manager using the system to fetch orders by a specific date.

2. **Management Interface (MI)**: The user interface through which the manager interacts with the system. It sends the manager's requests to the backend server.

3. **Backend Server (BS)**: This component processes the request from the management interface. It interprets the request, queries the database for orders from the specified date, and then sends back the result.

4. **Database (DB)**: This stores all order data. When queried by the backend server, it returns the orders for the requested date.

5. **Sequence of Interactions**:
    - The Manager selects a date and requests to see orders from that date through the Management Interface.
    - The Management Interface forwards this request to the Backend Server.
    - The Backend Server queries the Database with the given date to fetch the orders.
    - The Database returns the matching orders to the Backend Server.
    - The Backend Server then sends the order details back to the Management Interface.
    - Finally, the Management Interface displays the order details to the Manager on the screen.

This sequence diagram represents a simple version of the interactions needed for a manager to display orders by a particular date. Depending on the complexity of the actual system and any additional features (like filtering, pagination, etc.), the sequence might include additional steps or complexities.

To capture the process of running a script by a system administrator to install the Neurohub node onto a virgin Ubuntu operating system, a sequence diagram in PlantUML format can be structured to highlight key interactions. Below is a simplified sequence diagram to depict this process. 

Please note, the specifics of the installation process (like specific commands run for installation, error handling, and detailed interactions with the Ubuntu system or user inputs) are abstracted here for brevity. You might need to adjust or expand upon this basic structure depending on the detailed requirements of your project and what the installation script actually does.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SysAdmin as "System Administrator"
participant Script as "Installation Script"
participant UbuntuSystem as "Ubuntu OS"
participant NeurohubNode as "Neurohub Node"

SysAdmin -> Script: execute(./install_neurohub.sh)
activate Script

Script -> UbuntuSystem: check_system_requirements()
activate UbuntuSystem
UbuntuSystem -> UbuntuSystem: validate_requirements()
UbuntuSystem --> Script: requirements_ok
deactivate UbuntuSystem

Script -> UbuntuSystem: install_dependencies()
activate UbuntuSystem
UbuntuSystem --> Script: dependencies_installed
deactivate UbuntuSystem

Script -> UbuntuSystem: configure_system_settings()
activate UbuntuSystem
UbuntuSystem --> Script: system_configured
deactivate UbuntuSystem

Script -> UbuntuSystem: download_neurohub_files()
activate UbuntuSystem
UbuntuSystem -> UbuntuSystem: fetch_from_repository()
UbuntuSystem --> Script: files_downloaded
deactivate UbuntuSystem

Script -> UbuntuSystem: install_neurohub_node()
activate UbuntuSystem
UbuntuSystem -> NeurohubNode: setup()
activate NeurohubNode
NeurohubNode --> UbuntuSystem: installation_complete
deactivate NeurohubNode
UbuntuSystem --> Script: neurohub_installed
deactivate UbuntuSystem

Script --> SysAdmin: installation_success
deactivate Script

This diagram captures the primary steps a system administrator would encounter while executing the script to install Neurohub on an Ubuntu OS. It consists of:

1. **Executing the Installation Script:** The system administrator starts the process by executing the installation script.
2. **System Requirements Check:** The script checks if the Ubuntu system meets the necessary requirements for installation.
3. **Installing Dependencies:** If the system requirements are satisfied, the script proceeds to install necessary dependencies on the Ubuntu system.
4. **Configuring System Settings:** Adjusts necessary system settings in preparation for the Neurohub node installation.
5. **Downloading Neurohub Files:** The script downloads the necessary Neurohub files from a repository.
6. **Installing Neurohub Node:** Finally, the script installs the Neurohub node onto the Ubuntu system.
7. **Success Confirmation:** Once the installation completes successfully, the script informs the system administrator.

This diagram can be adjusted in detail and complexity to more accurately reflect the Neurohub's specific installation procedures and any conditional logic, error handling, or additional steps involved in the installation process.

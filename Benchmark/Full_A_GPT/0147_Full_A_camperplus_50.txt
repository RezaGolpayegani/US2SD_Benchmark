Creating a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the given user story involves illustrating the process flow when a camp worker submits a completion report for an assigned task. This process will involve interactions with a user interface (UI), the system backend, and possibly a database where the tasks and their statuses are stored. Below is a straightforward example of what that sequence might look like in PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CampWorker as CW
participant "Worker UI" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Task Database" as DB

CW -> UI : Selects assigned task
UI -> Backend : Request task details
Backend -> DB : Query task details
DB -> Backend : Return task details
Backend -> UI : Display task details

CW -> UI : Submit completion report
UI -> Backend : Update task status to "Completed"
Backend -> DB : Update task record
DB -> Backend : Confirmation of record update
Backend -> UI : Display success message
UI -> CW : Display completion confirmation

### How to Read the Diagram

1. **Camp Worker to Worker UI**: The camp worker interacts with the user interface by selecting the assigned task they want to submit a report for. Later, they submit this report through the same UI.

2. **Worker UI to Backend System**: Once the task is selected, the UI requests its details from the backend system. After the camp worker submits their completion report, the UI informs the backend to update the task's status.

3. **Backend System to Task Database**: The backend system retrieves the details of the requested task and later updates the task record in the database when the camp worker submits their completion report.

4. **Confirmation Messages**: The database confirms the record update to the backend system, which then instructs the UI to show success messages to the camp worker both when displaying the task details and upon successful submission of the completion report.

This diagram is a basic representation and can be extended or modified based on more specific requirements or constraints of the Camp Management & Communication Platform project.

To generate a sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to update the reservation for each table," we need to outline the flow of actions that would be taken within the system to achieve this task. This sequence diagram will involve the waiter, the restaurant management and operations system, and possibly other components such as the database that stores reservation information.

Here's a PlantUML code example that illustrates the sequence diagram for updating a reservation for a table:
```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter as waiter
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Reservation System" as reservationSystem
database "DB Reservation Storage" as db

waiter -> ui : Selects 'Update Reservation'
activate ui

ui -> reservationson : Sends update request
activate reservationSystem

reservationSystem -> db : Query existing reservation
activate db
db --> reservationSystem : Reservation details
deactivate db

reservationSystem -> reservationSystem : Process updates
reservationSystem -> db : Save updated reservation
activate db
db --> reservationSystem : Confirmation
deactivate db

reservationSystem --> ui : Update confirmation
deactivate reservationSystem

ui --> waiter : Display confirmation message
deactivae ui

@enduml
```

### Breakdown of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Waiter Initiates Update**: The waiter selects the option to update a reservation, which initiates the process in the UI (User Interface) of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **Send Update Request to the Reservation System**: The UI forwards the waiter's request to the backend part of the system specifically designed to handle reservations.

3. **Query Existing Reservation**: The Reservation System needs to retrieve the current details of the reservation to be updated, so it queries the database.

4. **Process Reservation Updates**: After retrieving the existing reservation details, the Reservation System processes the changes requested by the waiter.

5. **Save Updated Reservation**: The updated reservation details are then saved back into the database by the Reservation System.

6. **Confirmation**: The Reservation System sends a confirmation of the updated reservation to the UI, which in turn displays a confirmation message to the waiter.

This diagram assumes a basic flow and can be expanded based on more detailed requirements, such as handling errors or ensuring that the reservation time and table are available.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where an archivist wants to automatically create access derivatives of digital objects, using PlantUML format, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initiation**: The archivist initiates the process by selecting the digital objects from a user interface.
2. **Authorization**: The system checks if the archivist is authorized to create access derivatives.
3. **Selection**: Once authorized, the system processes the selected digital objects.
4. **Creation Process**: The system automatically generates access derivatives of the selected digital objects.
5. **Metadata Update**: After the derivatives are created, the system updates the metadata to reflect the creation of the derivatives.
6. **Notification**: Finally, the system notifies the archivist that the access derivatives have been created successfully.

Below is the representation of the above process in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as A
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Authorization System" as Auth
participant "Object Management System" as OMS
participant "Derivative Creation System" as DCS
participant "Metadata System" as MS
participant "Notification System" as NS

A -> UI: Select digital objects for derivative creation
UI -> Auth: Check authorization
Auth --> A: Authorization confirmed
UI -> OMS: Process selected digital objects
OMS -> DCS: Create access derivatives
DCS -> MS: Update metadata with derivative details
MS -> DCS: Metadata updated
DCS -> NS: Send success notification
NS --> A: Notify archivist of successful creation

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the steps taken from the moment the archivist decides to create access derivatives to the point where they are notified of the completion of the process. It includes interactions with various systems such as the user interface, authorization system, object management system, the system responsible for the derivative creation, the metadata system, and the notification system.

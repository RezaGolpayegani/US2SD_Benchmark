Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a site member, I want to have full access to all articles, so that there is a benefit to being a member" involves illustrating how different system components interact with each other to fulfill this requirement. This sequence will be represented using PlantUML syntax. 

Keep in mind, to visualize this diagram, you'll need a PlantUML environment or online PlantUML viewer.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Membership Database" as MDB
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
database "Article Database" as ADB

M -> Auth: Authenticate
Auth -> MDB: Verify membership
MDB --> Auth: Membership status
Auth --> M: Authentication & Membership status

alt If member is authenticated and verified
    M -> CMS: Request access to all articles
    CMS -> ADB: Fetch all articles
    ADB --> CMS: Return all articles
    CMS --> M: Display all articles
else If authentication or membership verification fails
    Auth --> M: Deny access and suggest membership/login
end

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

1. **Member Authentication:** The sequence begins with the member (site user) attempting to authenticate. This is a critical step to ensure that only authenticated users can access premium content like articles in full.

2. **Verify Membership:** The Authentication System queries the Membership Database to check if the user is an active member. This step is crucial for enforcing access control based on membership status.

3. **Membership Status Response:** The Membership Database responds with the membership status of the user. Based on this, the Authentication System knows if the user should be granted access to all articles.

4. **Article Access Request:** Once the user is authenticated and their membership is verified, the member requests access to all articles from the Content Management System (CMS).

5. **Fetch and Display Articles:** The CMS then interacts with the Article Database to fetch all available articles. These articles are returned to the CMS, which in turn displays them to the member.

6. **Alternate Paths:** The diagram also illustrates alternate paths for scenarios where either the user authentication fails or the membership status is not verified. In such cases, access to all articles is denied, and the user is either suggested to log in again or to consider acquiring a membership.

This sequence diagram visually communicates the interactions between different system components involved in granting a site member full access to articles, emphasizing the importance of membership benefits within the platform.

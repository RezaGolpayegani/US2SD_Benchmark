Creating a detailed sequence diagram for your user story in PlantUML format involves several steps and components interacting with each other during the dataset upgrade process within a pipeline development context. Given the complexities of the advanced dataset management and version control system described, below is a high-level sequence diagram that outlines the interaction sequence for upgrading a dataset instance to a new version of its code after the creation of a pipeline.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor PipelineDeveloper as Developer
participant "Dataset Management\nSystem" as ManagementSystem
participant "Dataset Version\nControl" as VersionControl
participant "Application\nDeployment" as AppDeployment
participant Database as DB
participant Pipeline as Pipeline

Developer -> ManagementSystem : Request dataset instance upgrade information
ManagementSystem -> VersionControl : Query available dataset type versions
VersionControl --> ManagementSystem : Return available versions
ManagementSystem --> Developer : Display versions with upgrade impacts

Developer -> ManagementSystem : Select new version for upgrade
ManagementSystem -> VersionControl : Initiate upgrade process for dataset instance
activate VersionControl

VersionControl -> AppDeployment : Check application dependencies
activate AppDeployment
AppDeployment -> VersionControl : Confirm compatibility
deactivate AppDeployment

VersionControl -> DB : Prepare dataset instance upgrade
DB --> VersionControl : Upgrade readiness confirmation
VersionControl -> DB : Execute upgrade to new version
DB --> VersionControl : Upgrade success
deactivate VersionControl

VersionControl -> Pipeline : Update pipeline configuration
activate Pipeline
Pipeline -> Pipeline : Validate new dataset version compatibility
Pipeline --> VersionControl : Configuration validated
deactivate Pipeline

VersionControl --> ManagementSystem : Upgrade completion status
ManagementSystem --> Developer : Upgrade success notification

### Key Steps Explained:
1. **Pipeline Developer initiates the upgrade request**: This is where the developer requests information about upgrading a specific dataset instance to a newer version after the creation of a pipeline.

2. **Dataset Management System queries available versions**: The Dataset Management System inquires about available versions from the Dataset Version Control to present options to the developer.

3. **Developer selects a new version for the upgrade**: Upon reviewing the available versions and their respective impacts, the developer makes a selection for the upgrade.

4. **Version Control initiates the upgrade process**: This represents the version control system initiating the steps required for upgrading the dataset instance, including checking application dependencies and confirming compatibility.

5. **Database preparation and execution of the upgrade**: The system prepares the dataset instance residing in the database for the upgrade, executes the necessary steps to upgrade to the selected new version, and confirms success.

6. **Pipeline configuration update**: Finally, the pipeline configuration is updated with the new dataset version, ensuring that the pipeline validates and incorporates the updated dataset instance successfully, maintaining data compatibility and integrity throughout the process.

This diagram provides a generalized view of the sequence of actions involved in upgrading a dataset instance as part of a pipeline development process. Specific details and steps might vary depending on the actual implementation details and requirements of the Advanced Dataset Management and Version Control System.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves depicting the communication between different entities such as the Data Manager, the DMPTool system, external metadata tools, and data repositories. This sequence will outline how a Data Manager can obtain references to documentation of the data and its creation process for re-use and management. Given the complexity and the need for simplification, here's a conceptual approach to how this process might be modeled:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant DataManager as DM
participant "DMPTool System" as DMP
participant "External Metadata Tool" as EMT
participant "Data Repository" as DR

DM -> DMP: Request data documentation access
activate DMP
DMP -> EMT: Fetch metadata references
activate EMT
EMT --> DMP: Return metadata references
deactivate EMT
DMP -> DR: Retrieve data and creation process documentation
activate DR
DR --> DMP: Return documentation links
deactivate DR
DMP --> DM: Provide documentation and references
deactivate DMP
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Data Manager ('DM') requesting access to data documentation from the DMPTool system ('DMP'). The DMPTool then interacts with an external metadata tool ('EMT') to fetch metadata references, which are essential for understanding the data's structure and context. Subsequently, the DMPTool requests documentation on the data and its creation process from a data repository ('DR'), which stores the physical data along with its descriptive metadata and information about its origin. Finally, the DMPTool provides the Data Manager with the necessary documentation and references, enabling data re-use and efficient management. 

This sequence simplifies the interaction but captures the essence of the user story. Depending on the complexity of the DMPTool and its integration capabilities, additional steps or actors might be involved in a real-world application.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to read an order" involves illustrating the interaction between the system components, starting from the manager's request to view an order to the system's response displaying the order details. Below is an example of a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax that captures this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Frontend Interface" as F
participant "Backend Service" as B
participant "Database" as DB

M -> F : Request to view order
activate M
activate F
F -> B : Get order details for Manager
activate B
B -> DB : Query order details
activate DB
DB --> B : Return order details
deactivate DB
B --> F : Order details data
deactivate B
F --> M : Display order details
deactivate F
deactivate M
@enduml
```

This diagram represents the following sequence of events for the specified user story:

1. **Manager requests to view an order**: This starts the sequence, indicating the manager's intention to read an order's details through the system's user interface (Frontend Interface).

2. **Frontend Interface processes the request**: The Manager's request is received by the Frontend Interface, which in turn requests the order's details from the Backend Service.

3. **Backend Service queries the Database**: The Backend Service, upon receiving the request from the Frontend, proceeds to query the Database for the specified order's details.

4. **Database returns order details**: The Database processes the query and returns the relevant order details back to the Backend Service.

5. **Backend Service sends data to Frontend Interface**: With the order details retrieved, the Backend Service formats and sends this data back to the Frontend Interface.

6. **Manager views the order details**: Finally, the Frontend Interface presents the information to the Manager, completing the sequence of operations to read an order.

Remember, this is a simplified view meant for illustrative purposes. Actual implementations may involve additional layers of interaction or complexities such as authentication, error handling, and data formatting steps not shown in this basic sequence.

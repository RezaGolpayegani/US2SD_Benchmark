Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that represents the user story of placing reservations for publications that are currently unavailable. This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the member (user), the frontend application (client), and various backend components including the Reservation System, Book Management System, and Notification Service.

```
@startuml
participant Member
participant "Frontend Application" as Client
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation
participant "Book Management System" as BookManagement
participant "Notification Service" as Notification


Member -> Client : Search for publication
Client -> BookManagement : Request availability of publication
alt Publication Unavailable
    BookManagement -> Client : Show publication as unavailable
    Member -> Client : Request to reserve publication
    Client -> Reservation : Place reservation

    Reservation -> BookManagement : Check Publication Details
    BookManagement -> Reservation : Provide Publication Details

    Reservation -> Notification: Schedule notification for availability
    Notification -> Reservation : Confirmation

    Reservation --> Client : Reservation confirmation
    Client --> Member : Display reservation confirmation
else Publication Available
    BookManagement -> Client : Show publication as available
    Client -> Member : Display availability status
end

### How to Read the Sequence Diagram:

- The diagram starts with the Member (library user) searching for a publication through the Frontend Application (like a web or mobile library app).
- Then, the Fronteditor Application requests the Book Management System to check the availability of the desired publication.
- If the publication is unavailable:
  - The Book Management System informs the Frontend Application, which then displays this status to the Member.
  - The member requests to reserve the publication through the Frontend Application, which places a reservation in the Reservation System.
  - The Reservation System checks the publication details with the Book Management System and schedules a notification for when the publication becomes available using the Notification Service.
  * The Reservation System confirms the placement of the reservation back to the Frontend Application, which then shows a reservation confirmation to the Member.
- If the publication is available, the Book Management System directly informs the Frontend Application of its availability status, which is then displayed to the Member.

This simplified sequence diagram aims to capture the primary steps involved in placing a reservation for a currently unavailable publication. It can be expanded or modified depending on additional requirements or functionalities of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

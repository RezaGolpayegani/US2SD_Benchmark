Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format requires breaking down the interaction into specific steps that a data reuser would follow to search the archive through the web. Hereâ€™s a structured PlantUML code snippet that represents this user story.

Please note that this diagram assumes a simple interaction model between the data reuser, a web frontend, the system's backend, and the data archive. The exact interactions could be more complex depending on the specific architecture and technologies used by the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Reuser" as reuser
participant "Web Frontend" as frontend
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Data Archive" as archive

reuser -> frontend : Enter search query
frontend -> backend : Send search query
backend -> archive : Query datasets
activate archive
archive -> archive : Search matching datasets
deactivate archive
archive -> backend : Return search results
backend -> frontend : Send search results
frontend -> reuser : Display search results

```

This diagram outlines the following steps:

1. The "Data Reuser" initiates the process by entering a search query into the web interface ("Web Frontend").
2. The "Web Frontend" sends this search query to the "Backend System".
3. The "Backend System" queries the "Data Archive" with the search criteria.
4. The "Data Archive" searches its datasets for matches.
5. The "Data Archive" returns the search results to the "Backend System".
6. The "Backend System" sends these results back to the "Web Frontend".
7. The "Web Frontend" displays the search results to the "Data Reuser".

This sequence diagram can be modified or detailed further based on specific requirements or system design intricacies. For instance, steps to handle errors, filter options, pagination of results, or preview of datasets could also be included for a more comprehensive overview.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a site member who has seen a teaser on the front page, I want to read the entire article so that I can finish articles that appeal to me." involves illustrating the interactions between the site member, the web interface, and the backend server/database that lead to displaying the full article content. The sequence starts when the member sees the teaser and ends with the member reading the full article.

Given the complexity and the text-based nature of PlantUML, the diagram will represent a simplified flow of operations. Here's how it can be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant Member as M
participant "Front End" as FE
participant "Back End" as BE
database "Database" as DB

M -> FE : Selects article teaser
FE -> BE : Request article ID/details
BE -> DB : Query article content
DB -> BE : Return full article
BE -> FE : Return article details
FE -> M : Display full article

@enduml
```
Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Member (M)**: The site member interacts with the Front End (FE) by selecting an article teaser they are interested in.
2. **Front End (FE)**: The FE communicates the member's interest by sending a request to the Back End (BE), including the ID or details of the desired article.
3. **Back End (BE)**: Once the BE receives the request, it queries the Database (DB) for the content of the full article that matches the provided ID/details.
4. **Database (DB)**: The DB returns the full article content to the BE, including any associated multimedia or metadata necessary for the FE to properly display the article.
5. **Back End (BE)**: The BE processes the full article content and forwards it to the FE.
6. **Front End (FE)**: Finally, the FE renders the full article content on the site member's device, allowing them to read the entire article as they wished.

This sequence diagram abstracts away from the detailed implementation specifics, such as authentication and authorization processes, and focuses on the main flow related to fetching and displaying an article. Depending on the exact requirements and platform architecture, additional steps may be necessary.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves outlining the interactions between the repository manager, the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS), and possibly other systems or services involved in generating the storage consumption report. Below is an example of how you could represent these interactions in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "EDRMS" as EDRMS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Reporting Module" as Report

RM -> EDRMS : Request storage report by financial contact
activate EDRMS

EDRMS -> DB : Query storage data
activate DB

DB --> EDRMS : Return storage data
deactivate DB

EDRMS -> Report : Generate report based on data
activate Report

Report --> EDRMS : Report generated
deactivate Report

EDRMS --> RM : Provide storage report
deactivate EDRMS

note over RM : Analyzes report for\nfinancial tracking and oversight
@enduml
```

This diagram translates the user story into a sequence of interactions:

1. **Repository Manager Requests Report**: The repository manager initiates the process by requesting a report on storage consumed by each financial contact from the EDRMS.

2. **Query Storage Data**: The EDRMS, upon receiving the request, accesses the database to query the necessary storage data.

3. **Database Returns Data**: The database processes this query and returns the relevant data to the EDRMS.

4. **Generate Report**: The EDRMS then uses this data to generate the report through its Reporting Module.

5. **Report Provided**: Once the report is generated, it is provided back to the repository manager.

6. **Analyzation**: The repository manager analyzes the report for financial tracking and oversight purposes.

The above steps are an abstract representation, and depending on the actual implementation, there may be additional interactions with other systems or services (e.g., financial tracking systems, external reporting tools). Also, the level of detail can be adjusted based on the requirements; for example, authentication and authorization steps could be added, or interactions could be detailed further.

To render this UML diagram, you would need to use a UML tool that supports PlantUML, such as various online editors or IDE plugins.

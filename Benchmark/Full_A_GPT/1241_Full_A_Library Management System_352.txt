Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a staff, I want to reserve a book to a member, so that I can keep track of books." in PlantUML involves outlining the interactions between objects (e.g., Staff, Reservation System, Database) from when a staff initiates a reservation to when the reservation is logged in the system.

Below is the PlantUML code for the described sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Staff
participant "Reservation System" as RS
database "Database" as DB

== Reserve a Book for a Member ==

Staff -> RS: selectBookForMember(bookID, memberID)
activate RS

RS -> DB: checkBookAvailability(bookID)
activate DB
DB --> RS: bookAvailability(status)
deactivate DB

alt if book is available
    RS -> DB: reserveBook(bookID, memberID)
    activate DB
    DB --> RS: reservationSuccess
    deactivate DB
    
    RS --> Staff: displaySuccessMessage(reservationDetails)
else book is not available
    RS --> Staff: displayErrorMessage(bookUnavailableMessage)
end

deactivate RS
@enduml
```

### Walkthrough of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Interaction Start:** The sequence begins when a staff member initiates a book reservation for a library member by selecting a book and member identifier.
   
2. **Reservation System:** The staff's request is processed by the Reservation System.

3. **Check Book Availability:** The Reservation System queries the Database to check if the requested book is available.
   
4. **Database Response:** The Database returns the status of the book (available or not available).

5. **Condition:** 
   - If the book is available, the Reservation System proceeds to reserve the book for the member.
   - If the book is not available, an error message is displayed to the staff.

6. **Reserve Book (if available):** The Reservation System commands the Database to reserve the book, which logs the reservation details.

7. **Success or Error Message:** Based on the book's availability, the staff is shown a success message with reservation details or an error message stating the book is unavailable.

8. **End Interaction:** The sequence concludes after displaying the appropriate message to the staff.

This diagram represents a simplified view focusing on the core interactions for reserving a book to a member. Implementations might involve additional steps or details, such as authentication checks, logging, or handling concurrent reservations.

To provide a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As an Older Person, I want to have ALFRED to detect falls and send an emergency message to a specific contact" using PlantUML format, we will outline the interactions involving the user (Older Person), the ALFRED device, and the emergency contact notification process. The sequence will display how the fall detection and subsequent notification sequence is enacted.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as "Older Person"
participant "ALFRED's Sensor" as Sensor
participant "ALFRED's Core" as Core
participant "ALFRED's Communication Module" as CommModule
participant "Emergency Contact" as Contact

== Fall Detection Sequence ==
OlderPerson -> Sensor: Fall
activate Sensor

Sensor -> Core: Detects fall
activate Core

Core -> Core: Assess fall severity
alt severity high
    Core -> CommModule: Trigger emergency protocol
    activate CommModule

    CommModule -> Contact: Send emergency notification
    activate Contact
    deactivate Contact
    
    CommModule -> Core: Confirmation of notification sent
    deactivate CommModule

    Core -> OlderPerson: Notify: "Emergency contact alerted"
    deactivate Core
else severity low or uncertain
    Core -> OlderPerson: Notify: "Detected a fall, are you okay?"
    deactivate Core
    
    OlderPerson -> Core: Response: "Need help"
    activate Core

    Core -> CommModule: Trigger emergency protocol (upon user's request)
    activate CommModule

    CommModule -> Contact: Send emergency notification (user confirmed)
    activate Contact
    deactivate Contact

    CommModule -> Core: Confirmation of notification(sent)
    deactivate CommModule

    Core -> OlderPerson: Notify: "Emergency contact notified per your request"
    deactivate Core
end

This diagram highlights the process starting from the fall detection by ALFRED's sensor, assessment of the fall severity, and then either automatically sending an emergency notification to a predefined contact in cases of high severity or asking the user for confirmation if the fall's severity is low or uncertain. Upon user confirmation, an emergency notification is sent. This ensures that help is dispatched promptly when needed while also allowing the user to confirm or cancel the alert in less severe situations, reducing false alarms.

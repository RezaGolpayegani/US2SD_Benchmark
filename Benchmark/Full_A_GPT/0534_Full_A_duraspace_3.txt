To illustrate the user story of constraining curatorial access specifically for a repository manager within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS), a detailed sequence diagram can be written in PlantUML. This diagram will showcase the interaction sequence involved when a repository manager sets up access controls to limit curatorial access to their unit's assets.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Access Control Module" as ACM
participant "Database" as DB
participant "DAMS Manager" as DM

RM -> Interface: Request access control settings
activate Interface
Interface -> ACM: Load access control settings form
activate ACM
ACM --> Interface: Display form
Interface --> RM: Show form
deactivate Interface
RM -> Interface: Submit access control specifics\n(for unit staff and DAMS managers)
activate Interface
Interface -> ACM: Process access control rules
activate ACM

ACM -> DB: Update access control settings
activate DB
DB --> ACM: Confirm update
deactivate DB
ACM --> Interface: Confirm access control update
deactivate ACM

Interface -> DM: Notify of access change
activate DM
DM --> Interface: Acknowledge notification
deactivate DM

Interface --> RM: Show success message
deactivate Interface

This diagram begins with the repository manager accessing the DIMS interface to request the access control settings page. From there, the interaction flow includes the submission of new access control parameters (specific to allowing access only to unit staff and DAMS managers), updating these settings in the database, and finally, notifying the DAMS managers of the change, ensuring they're aware of their universal access rights. The sequence ends with a confirmation message displayed back to the repository manager. 

The PlantUML sequence diagram succinctly wraps up the interaction flow, detailing the backend processes triggered by a repository managerâ€™s action to update access control measures within the DIMS environment.

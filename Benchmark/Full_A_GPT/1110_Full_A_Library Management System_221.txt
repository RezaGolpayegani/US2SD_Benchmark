For this request, I'll provide you with a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram focusing on the user story: "As a manager, I want to see the feedbacks." This sequence will cover how a library manager interacts with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to access feedback from users. This diagram is a starting point and may need adjustments based on specific system implementations and feedback needs.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Server: CLMS Controller" as controller
database "CLMS Database" as database

manager -> web : Request to see feedbacks
activate web

web -> controller : GetFeedbackRequest()
activate controller

controller -> database : QueryFeedbacks()
activate database

database --> controller : ReturnFeedbackList
deactivate database

controller --> web : FeedbackDetails()
deactivate controller

web --> manager : DisplayFeedbacks
deactivate web

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Manager Request:** The library manager initiates the process by requesting to see the feedbacks through the system's web interface. This could be done by navigating through the administrative panel to the feedback section.

2. **Web Interface to Controller:** The web interface forwards this request to the system's server-side controller (the central logic handler of the CLMS) as a call to retrieve the requested feedbacks.

3. **Controller Queries Database:** The CLMS controller, upon receiving the request, queries the CLMS database to retrieve all the available feedbacks. This would involve executing a database operation that selects feedback entries from the feedback storage table or collection.

4. **Database Returns Feedbacks:** The database processes the query and returns a list of feedbacks to the controller. This list contains the details of user feedbacks such as user ID, feedback text, timestamp, and any other relevant information stored in the system.

5. **Controller to Web Interface:** The controller, having received the feedback details, forwards this information back to the web interface. This data is prepared and formatted appropriately for display.

6. **Display Feedbacks to Manager:** Finally, the web interface presents the feedback information to the manager. This could be in the form of a list or table that organizes the feedback for easy reading and analysis by the library manager.

### Notes:

- This sequence assumes that feedback retrieval does not require additional authentication or authorization steps for simplicity. In a real system, there might be security checks between the initial request and the information delivery.
- The specific details of the feedback (such as categories, importance, or related book/user information) are abstracted out in this diagram. You can add more detail depending on the requirements.
- Adjusting the complexity and depth of interaction can further refine this scenario, including filters for feedback, pagination, or handling large datasets efficiently.

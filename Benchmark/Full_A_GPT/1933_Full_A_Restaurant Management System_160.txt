Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story in Plant UML format requires understanding the sequence of interactions between different entities/objects to fulfill the request of knowing the total number of orders per product by a manager. Below is a PlantUML code that outlines this interaction sequence.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "Management Interface" as Interface
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant Database

Manager -> Interface : Request total orders per product
Interface -> Backend : Query for total orders per product
Backend -> Database : Fetch order data
Database --> Backend : Order data
Backend --> Interface : Aggregate order info
Interface --> Manager : Display order totals

@endAmL
```

Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Manager to Management Interface**: The sequence starts with the manager requesting the total number of orders per product. This interaction is typically initiated through a graphical user interface (GUI) in the restaurant management system.

2. **Management Interface to Backend System**: The request is forwarded to the backend system. This layer is responsible for handling business logic, including data querying and processing.

3. **Backend System to Database**: The backend system sends a request to the database to fetch the order data. This step involves querying the database for information about all orders, grouped by product.

4. **Database to Backend System**: The database returns the requested order data to the backend system. The data includes detailed order information that allows the backend to calculate the total number of orders per product.

5. **Backend System to Management Interface**: After processing the data, the backend system aggregates the order information, calculating the total number of orders for each product. This aggregated data is then sent back to the management interface.

6. **Management Interface to Manager**: Finally, the management interface displays the order totals to the manager, allowing them to see which products are most popular and make informed decisions about future investments.

The diagram above outlines a simplified sequence of interactions to fulfill the manager's request. Implementing this in a real system might require additional steps and interactions, especially concerning authentication, error handling, and data validation, to ensure the system's integrity and security.

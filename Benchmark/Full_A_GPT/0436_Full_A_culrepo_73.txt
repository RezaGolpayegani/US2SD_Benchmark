Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this user story involves illustrating the sequence of interactions between different system components and actors to make resources developed for specific projects and geographic areas available to faculty and educators across New York State (NYS). Given the context of your project description, let's draft a simple sequence diagram outline in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Extension Administrator" as EA
participant "Repository Web Interface" as RWI
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Metadata Handler" as MH
participant "Access Control" as AC
participant "Notification System" as NS
database "Repository Database" as RD

EA -> RWI : Accesses Repository
RWN -> Auth : Authentication Request
Auth -> RWI : Authentication Response
activate Auth
deactivate Auth

EA -> RWI : Selects 'Upload Resource'
RWI -> CMS : Initiate Resource Upload
CMS -> MH : Add Metadata
activate MH
MH -> RD : Update Metadata
deactivate MH

EA -> CMS : Define Access/Visibility Settings
CMS -> AC : Set Access Permissions
activate AC
RD <- AC : Apply Permissions to Resource
deactivate AC

EA -> CMS : Specify Geographic Areas and Projects
CMS -> MH : Update Resource Metadata with Tags
MH -> RD : Save Updated Metadata

EA -> RWI : Confirm & Finalize Upload
RWI -> CMS : Process Confirmation
CMS -> RD : Store Resource Information
CMS -> NS : Send Notifications
activate NS
NS -> EA : Notification of Availability to Faculty
deactivate NS

This diagram outlines the basic sequence initiated by an Extension Administrator to upload and make resources available across NYS through the comprehensive digital repository system developed for Cornell University. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Authentication:** The Extension Administrator accesses the repository web interface and is authenticated.
2. **Upload and Metadata Handling:** They select to upload a resource, and the Content Management System (CMS) initiates the resource upload process, during which metadata is added to describe the resource, including specifying the applicable geographic areas and projects.
3. **Access Control Setting:** The administrator defines who can see and access the resource by setting visibility and access permissions, which are applied to the resource in the repository database.
4. **Notification:** Upon confirming and finalizing the resource upload, the CMS processes this confirmation, stores the updated resource information in the repository database, and triggers the notification system to alert faculty and educators about the new availability.

This sequence diagram is a simplified view focusing on the interactions related to the user story of the Extension Administrator. Depending on system complexity and specific implementation details, further refinement and additional elements may be necessary for a full system design.

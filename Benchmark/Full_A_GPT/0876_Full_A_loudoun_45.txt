Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a user story like "As an Applicant, I want to Complete Building Development Project, so that I can receive any posted bond and/or obtain occupancy" involves demonstrating the various system interactions that would take place within the County Services & Property Information Portal. Given the complexity and the various steps involved in such a process, let's draft a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram showcasing the key interactions.

Please note, due to the complexity and the nature of PlantUML syntax, this is a simplified version of the sequence diagram, focusing on major steps from the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Applicant as app
participant "User Account System" as uas
participant "Application Submission System" as ass
participant "Development Permit System" as dps
participant "Inspection Request System" as irs
participant "Bond Management System" as bms
participant "Occupancy Certificate System" as ocs

== Complete Building Development Project ==

app -> uas : Log in to account
uas --> app : Authentication Successful

app -> ass : Access Submitted Application
ass --> app : Display Application Details

app -> dps : Request Development Permit Completion
dps -> irs : Initiate Final Inspection Request
irs --> dps : Schedule Inspection
dps --> app : Notify Inspection Date

app -> irs : Complete Inspection
irs -> bms : Trigger Bond Release Process
bms --> app : Bond Release Confirmation

irs -> ocs : Generate Occupancy Certificate
ocs --> app : Provide Occupancy Certificate

```

This sequence begins with the applicant logging into their account and proceeds through accessing their application, requesting for the completion of the development permit (which includes scheduling and completing a final building inspection), initiating the bond release process, and ending with the issuance of the occupancy certificate.

**Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Log in to account**: The Applicant logs in to their user account within the portal.
2. **Access Submitted Application**: The Applicant views their previously submitted application for the building development project.
3. **Request Development Permit Completion**: The Applicant indicates that the project is ready for completion review.
4. **Initiate Final Inspection Request**: The Development Permit System communicates with the Inspection Request System to schedule a final inspection.
5. **Notify Inspection Date**: The Applicant is informed of the inspection date.
6. **Complete Inspection**: The inspection is conducted; if successful, it triggers the next steps.
7. **Trigger Bond Release Process**: Assuming the inspection passes, the bond management process is initiated.
8. **Bond Release Confirmation**: The Applicant receives confirmation that any posted bond has been released.
9. **Generate Occupancy Certificate**: Following successful inspection and bond release, the occupancy certificate is generated and provided to the applicant.

Remember that in real-world applications, this sequence would be more complex and involve additional error handling, security checks, and possibly interactions with other systems or services not detailed in this simplified view.

Creating a detailed UML sequence diagram specifically tailored to your request using PlantUML syntax involves outlining the interaction between different components for the user story of an archivist wanting to use archival content on the RAC website. Below is a simplified example that captures the core steps involved in this process:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Archivist
participant "RAC Website" as Website
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant ArchiveDatabase
participant "Digital Asset Manager" as DAM

== Upload Archival Content ==
Archivist -> CMS: Login
activate CMS
CMS --> Archivist: Authentication Success

Archivist -> CMS: Navigate to Upload Section
activate CMS

Archivist -> DAM: Select Files to Upload
activate DAM
DAM -> ArchiveDatabase: Save File Metadata
activate ArchiveDatabase
ArchiveDatabase --> DAM: Confirm Save
DAM --> Archivist: Display Uploaded Files

== Integrate Content into Web Pages ==
Archivist -> CMS: Create/Edit Web Page
CMS --> Archivist: Access Web Page Editor

Archivist -> CMS: Insert Archival Content
CMS -> DAM: Retrieve File Links/Embed Codes
DAM --> CMS: Return Links/Embed Codes
CMS --> Archivist: Display Preview

Archivist -> CMS: Publish Changes
CMS -> Website: Update Web Page Content
Website --> Archivist: Confirm Publication

deactivate DAM
deactivate ArchiveDatabase
deactivate CMS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Archivist logging into the Content Management System (CMS) of the RAC website. Once authenticated, the archivist navigates to the upload section, selects files for upload, and interacts with the Digital Asset Manager (DAM) to save the selected files' metadata in the Archive Database. The DAM confirms the files are uploaded by displaying them to the Archivist.

Next, to integrate the uploaded content into the web pages, the Archivist creates or edits a web page, inserts the archival content (which the CMS retrieves from the DAM as file links or embed codes), and displays a preview. Upon publishing the changes, the CMS updates the website content, and a confirmation of publication is sent to the Archivist.

This diagram abstracts the detailed interactions into high-level processes to maintain clarity and focus on the archivist's goal of using archival content on the RAC website. Tailoring this to the specifics of your project's technology stack or adding more granular interactions may require additional details based on the actual implementation and tools used.

Given the complexity of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project, generating a detailed sequence diagram for a user story focusing on viewing the provenance of the page as part of the search results involves several components. In this context, "provenance" likely refers to the origin, history, or ownership details associated with certain data or page contents within the Neurohub platform. This feature is particularly useful in research settings where understanding the history and source of the data is crucial.

Below is a simplified PlantUML code snippet that represents a sequence diagram for the stated user story. This diagram includes interactions between the user, the search interface, the server (which handles search queries and fetches data), and the database (where data, along with its provenance, is stored).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Search Interface" as Interface
participant Server
database "Neurohub Database" as Database

User -> Interface: Enter search query
activate Interface

Interface -> Server: Pass query
activate Server

Server -> Database: Request data & provenance
activate Database

Database --> Server: Return data & provenance
deactivate Database

Server --> Interface: Display results with provenance
deactivate Server

Interface --> User: Show search results & provenance details
deactivate Interface

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram summarizes the process:
1. **User Interaction**: The user starts by entering a search query into the search interface.
2. **Search Query Processing**: The search interface passes the query to the server.
3. **Data and Provenance Fetching**: The server requests the data and its provenance from the database based on the search query.
4. **Result Compilation**: The database responds with the requested data and its provenance.
5. **Display Results**: The server processes the received data and sends it back to the search interface, which then presents the search results alongside the provenance details to the user.

This sequence diagram is simplified and abstracts some complexities, such as error handling and the specific nature of the data requests (e.g., API calls, direct database queries). Depending on the Neurohub system's architecture, additional components or steps might be involved in providing provenance information as part of the search results.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves illustrating the interactions between the agency user and the Broker platform components to ensure Excel does not strip off leading and trailing zeroes from data elements when they are surrounded by quotation marks. Below is a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this process.

Please note that due to the complexity and the high level of detail in the project description, the following sequence diagram takes a generalized approach. You might need to adjust or expand it depending on specific system behaviors or additional components involved in your Broker platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AgencyUser as "Agency User"
participant BrokerUI as "Broker UI"
participant ValidationService as "Validation Service"
participant DataService as "Data Service"
participant Database as "Database"

AgencyUser -> BrokerUI : Submits data with quotation
BrokerUI -> ValidationService : Validate data format
alt Data Format Valid
  ValidationService -> DataService : Process data submission
  DataService -> Database : Store data with quotation
  Database --> DataService : Confirm data stored
  DataService --> BrokerUI : Display success message
  BrokerUI --> AgencyUser : Notify submission success
else Data Format Invalid
  ValidationService -> BrokerUI : Error: Invalid data format
  BrokerUI --> AgencyUser : Show error message
end
@enduml
```

To break down the sequence:

1. **Agency User Submits Data:** The agency user starts by submitting their data, which includes data elements surrounded by quotation marks, using the Broker UI (User Interface).

2. **Validation Service Checks Format:** The Broker UI sends the data to the Validation Service to ensure the format meets the requirement â€“ particularly, checking if the data elements are correctly encapsulated within quotation marks.

3. **Processing Data Submission:** If the data format is valid, the Validation Service passes the data to the DataService for further processing.

4. **Storing Data:** The DataService then proceeds to store the data in the Database, ensuring that the quotation marks are preserved.

5. **Confirmation and Feedback:** Upon successful storage, the DataService sends a confirmation back to the Broker UI, which in turn notifies the agency user of the successful submission.

6. **Error Handling:** If at any stage the data does not meet the format requirement (for instance, if the quotation marks are missing), the Validation Service sends an error message back to the Broker UI. The BrokerUI then displays an error message to the agency user.

This sequence diagram abstractly represents the desired interaction and process flow based on the provided user story. Depending on the actual architecture and requirements of your Broker platform, additional steps or components might be involved.

To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story "As a manager, I want to update the online menu" using PlantUML syntax, it's important to identify the key interactions between the system components and actors involved in this process. The following sequence diagram outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Manager
participant Browser
participant WebServer as "Web Server"
participant ApplicationServer as "Application Server"
participant Database

Manager -> Browser: Access menu management page
Browser -> WebServer: Request menu management page
WebServer -> ApplicationServer: Ask for page content
ApplicationServer -> Database: Fetch current menu data
Database -> ApplicationServer: Return menu data
ApplicationServer -> WebServer: Generate HTML content
WebServer -> Browser: Send HTML content
Browser -> Manager: Display menu management interface

Manager -> Browser: Perform updates (Add/Delete/Modify items)
Browser -> WebServer: Submit update request
WebServer -> ApplicationServer: Process request
activate ApplicationServer
ApplicationServer -> Database: Update menu records
Database -> ApplicationServer: Confirm update
deactivate ApplicationServer
ApplicationServer -> WebServer: Acknowledge completion
WebServer -> Browser: Show success message
Browser -> Manager: Display update confirmation

This diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions that occur from the moment the manager decides to update the online menu, through the system updating the records in the database, and until the manager receives a confirmation of the successful update.

### Explanation of Steps:

1. **Manager Accesses Menu Management:** The manager starts by accessing the menu management page through their browser.
2. **Request and Response for Page:** The web server receives the request for the menu management page and communicates with the application server to fetch the current menu data from the database.
3. **Display Current Menu:** The application server retrieves the menu data from the database, generates the corresponding HTML content, and sends it back to the manager's browser for display.
4. **Manager Updates Menu:** Through the menu management interface, the manager makes the desired updates (adding, deleting, or modifying menu items).
5. **Submit Update Request:** The browser sends the update request to the web server, which then forwards it to the application server.
6. **Process Update in Database:** The application server updates the menu records in the database according to the manager’s request.
7. **Confirmation of Update:** Upon successful update, the database confirms back to the application server, which then acknowledges the completion to the web server. Finally, the web server informs the manager’s browser, which displays a success message to the manager.

This sequence diagram provides a clear overview of interactions involved in updating the online menu from the manager's perspective, using PlantUML notation.

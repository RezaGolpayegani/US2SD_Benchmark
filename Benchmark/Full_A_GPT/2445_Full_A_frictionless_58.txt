Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the scenario where a researcher wants to generate basic statistics about a dataset using PlantUML syntax requires a clear understanding of the actors, systems, and processes involved in the operation. Below is a simplified example that assumes the DPIE platform includes a service for generating statistics, and the researcher interacts with a web interface to initiate the process.

Please note, this is a textual representation and to visualize it, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment (like an online editor or a locally installed PlantUML tool).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as researcher
participant "DPIE Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "DataPackage Service" as dataService
participant "Statistics Generator" as statsGen
database "Data Package Repository" as dataRepo

researcher -> webInterface : Request statistics for dataset
webInterface -> dataService : Validate dataset exists
dataService -> dataRepo : Query dataset details
dataRepo --> dataService : Dataset details
alt dataset found
    dataService --> webInterface : Dataset validation success
    webInterface -> statsGen : Send dataset for statistics generation
    statsGen -> dataRepo : Fetch dataset
    dataRepo --> statsGen : Dataset
    statsGen -> statsGen : Calculate basic statistics
    statsGen --> webInterface : Statistics result
    webInterface --> researcher : Display basic statistics
else dataset not found
    dataService --> webInterface : Dataset validation failure
    webInterface --> researcher : Show error message
end

### Explanation:
- **Researcher**: Initiates the request for generating basic statistics of a dataset.
- **DPIE Web Interface**: The front-facing interface where the researcher makes the request.
- **DataPackage Service**: Validates the existence and accessibility of the requested dataset.
- **Statistics Generator**: A hypothetical service that calculates basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, etc.
- **Data Package Repository**: Where datasets are stored and from which the required dataset is fetched for analysis.

### Workflow Steps:
1. The **Researcher** requests basic statistics about a specific dataset via the **DPIE Web Interface**.
2. The **Web Interface** relays this request to the **DataPackage Service** to validate if the dataset exists and is accessible.
3. The **DataPackage Service** queries the **Data Package Repository** for dataset details.
4. If the dataset is found, the repository returns the dataset details, and the **DataPackage Service** informs the **Web Interface** about the successful validation.
5. The **Web Interface** then requests the **Statistics Generator** to calculate the basic statistics.
6. The **Statistics Generator** fetches the dataset from the **Data Package Repository**.
7. It calculates the basic statistics and returns the results back to the **Web Interface**.
8. Finally, the **Web Interface** displays the basic statistics to the **Researcher**.
9. If at any point the dataset is not found or is inaccessible, an error message is relayed back to the **Researcher**.

This sequence diagram presents a high-level overview of the interactions. Implementation details such as specific technologies, data formats, or statistical methods are not included but can be incorporated as needed.

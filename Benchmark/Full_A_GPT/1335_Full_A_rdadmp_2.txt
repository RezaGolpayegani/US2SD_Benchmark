Given your request, below is a simplified PlantUML code snippet to represent the sequence diagram for the specified user story. This sequence focuses on a researcher indicating where data will be stored during and after a research project within the context of the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "DMPTool Interface" as ui
participant "Data Storage\nPlanning Module" as dsp
participant "Metadata Repository" as meta
participant "Institutional Systems\n(Integration)" as inst

== Data Storage Indication Process ==

res -> ui : Access DMPTool
ui -> dsp : Choose to document data storage plans
dsp -> dsp : Display data storage plan form

res -> dsp : Input data storage locations\n(during and after the project)
dsp -> meta : Store data storage plans
meta -> meta : Update metadata with data locations

dsp -> dsp : Confirm data storage plan saved
dsp -> inst : Send storage plan details\n(Optional integration)
inst -> inst : Update institutional repository/system

dsp -> ui : Display confirmation message
ui -> res : Display success and next steps

This sequence diagram starts with the researcher accessing the DMPTool Interface, choosing to document the data storage plans, and filling in where the data will be stored during and after the project. The information is then stored and updated in the Metadata Repository, which might also be integrated with the Institutional Systems for broader visibility and compliance. Finally, a confirmation of the successful data storage planning is displayed to the researcher.

Please note, the sequence diagram is kept relatively high level to focus on the main actions related to the user story. Depending on the specifics of the DMPTool and institutional systems, more detailed interactions like authentication, error handling, notifications, and the precise nature of integrations (API calls, data format transformations, etc.) could be added.

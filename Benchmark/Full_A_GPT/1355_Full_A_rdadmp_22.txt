Creating a detailed sequence diagram to represent the interactions involved in a data manager querying to understand the content of data to ensure maintenance and intellectual reusability involves various actors and systems interacting with the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool). Below is a PlantUML code snippet that visualizes this process.

Please note that this example assumes a relatively simple flow where a data manager uses the DMPTool to query data metadata and analyze the content's nature to determine if the required expertise for maintaining its intellectual reusability is available. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "Metadata Repository" as Metadata
participant "Expertise Database" as ExpertiseDB
participant "Data Content Analysis Module" as AnalysisModule

== Query Data Content ==
DataManager -> Interface : Access DMPTool to check data content
Interface -> Metadata : Request metadata for specified data
Metadata --> Interface : Return metadata details
Interface --> DataManager : Display metadata content

== Analyze Data Content for Reusability ==
DataManager -> Interface : Request analysis on data content
Interface -> AnalysisModule : Send data content for analysis
AnalysisModule -> ExpertiseDB : Query available expertise for content type
ExpertiseDB --> AnalysisModule : Return expertise availability
AnalysisModule --> Interface : Analysis results (expertise matched/unmatched)
Interface --> DataManager : Display analysis results & expertise status

This code snippet begins with the DataManager initiating the process by accessing the DMPTool to check the content of the data. The DMPTool Interface then requests the metadata for the specified data from the Metadata Repository, which returns the details back to the Interface. The Interface displays these metadata content details to the DataManager.

Next, the DataManager requests an analysis of the data content to determine if the necessary expertise for maintaining intellectual reusability is available. The DMPTool Interface forwards this request to the Data Content Analysis Module, which in turn queries an Expertise Database for any available expertise related to the data content type. The Expertise Database provides information on whether the necessary expertise is matched or unmatched, and these analysis results are relayed back to the DataManager through the Interface.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interactions involved but gives a good overview of the steps a data manager might take to ensure the intellectual reusability of data through the DMPTool.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of a Repository Manager who wants to create, update, and delete records in a repository, involves outlining the interactions between the user and the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS) alongside other components involved in this process.

Given the complexity of the process, below is a simplistic overview which can be expanded based on system specifics. This sequence diagram is made with PlantUML syntax and focuses on the basic interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant RepositoryManager as RM
participant CAMSFrontend as CF
participant CAMSBackend as CB
participant Database as DB

== Record Creation ==
RM -> CF : Navigate to record creation page
CF -> CB : Request record creation form
CB -> CF : Return record creation form
CF -> RM : Display record creation form
RM -> CF : Fill form and submit
CF -> CB : Validate and create request
CB -> DB : Insert record data
DB --> CB : Acknowledge record creation
CB --> CF : Confirmation of record creation
CF --> RM : Display creation success message

== Record Update ==
RM -> CF : Search and select record
CF -> CB : Request record details
CB -> DB : Retrieve record details
DB --> CB : Return record details
CB --> CF : Display record details
CF --> RM : Show record details
RM -> CF : Modify details and submit
CF -> CB : Validate and update request
CB -> DB : Update record data
DB --> CB : Acknowledge record update
CB --> CF : Confirmation of record update
CF --> RM : Display update success message

== Record Deletion ==
RM -> CF : Select delete option for record
CF -> CB : Request record deletion
CB -> DB : Delete record
DB --> CB : Acknowledge record deletion
CB --> CF : Confirmation of record deletion
CF --> RM : Display deletion success message

This diagram begins with the Repository Manager navigating to the record creation page, interacting with the system's frontend and backend, and communicating with the database to create, update, and delete records.

- **Record Creation**: The sequence starts with the Repository Manager filling out a form to create a new record. After submission, the backend validates and processes the creation request, eventually storing the new record in the database.
  
- **Record Update**: When updating, the Repository Manager first locates and selects a record to update, modifies the details through a form, and submits the changes. The system then updates the existing database record.
  
- **Record Deletion**: For deletion, the Repository Manager selects a record for removal. The system processes this request and deletes the specific record from the database.

This diagram simplifies the interactions to focus on illustrating the process flow as concisely as possible. Depending on the actual system architecture and requirements, more intermediary steps, error handling, and interactions might be necessary for a comprehensive design.

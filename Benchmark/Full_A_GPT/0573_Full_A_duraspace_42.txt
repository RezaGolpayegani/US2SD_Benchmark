To create a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the provided user story, you first need to understand the key actors and the steps they would take to perform the desired action within the DIMS. The primary action here involves a repository manager indicating a specific copyright status for a component of a digital object that differs from the object as a whole.

Given this requirement, let's outline the sequence of interactions that might occur:

1. The Repository Manager initiates the action to update the copyright status of a component.
2. The DIMS frontend interface receives the command and prompts the manager for the necessary information.
3. The Repository Manager provides the updated copyright information for the component.
4. The DIMS frontend sends this information to the backend server.
5. The server processes the request and updates the metadata associated with the specified component in the database.
6. The database acknowledges the update.
7. The server confirms the successful update to the frontend.
8. The frontend notifies the Repository Manager of the update's success.

Given this flow, the corresponding PlantUML sequence diagram code would look as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Frontend" as DF
participant "DIMS Backend Server" as DBS
database "DIMS Database" as DB

activate RM
RM -> DF : Initiates copyright status update for component
activate DF
DF -> RM : Prompts for copyright information
RM -> DF : Provides copyright information
DF -> DBS : Sends update request
activate DBS
DBS -> DB : Updates component metadata
activate DB
DB --> DBS : Acknowledges update
deactivate DB
DBS --> DF : Confirms update success
deactivate DBS
DF --> RM : Notifies of success
deactivate DF
deactivate RM

To visualize the sequence diagram, you'll need to use a platform or tool that supports PlantUML code interpretation, such as an online PlantUML editor, to render the sequence diagram. This code describes the sequence of messages and interactions between the repository manager, the DIMS frontend, the backend server, and the database necessary to accomplish the user story's objective.

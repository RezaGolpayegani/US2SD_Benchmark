Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves representing the interactions between different objects or entities to fulfill the requirement. For this scenario, the interactions include the Consumer checking the download count of different data packages to decide on the most popular one. Below is an illustrative sequence diagram in PlantUML format, which outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Consumer
participant PlatformUI
participant Database
participant AnalyticsService

== Checking Downloads Count for Data Packages ==

Consumer -> PlatformUI : Search for data packages
activate PlatformUI

PlatformUI -> Database : Query available data packages
activate Database

Database --> PlatformUI : Return data packages list
deactivate Database

PlatformUI --> Consumer : Display data packages list
deactivate PlatformUI

Consumer -> PlatformUI : Request download counts for packages
activate PlatformUI

PlatformUI -> AnalyticsService : Fetch download counts
activate AnalyticsService

AnalyticsService -> Database : Retrieve download statistics
activate Database

Database --> AnalyticsComplexService : Send statistics data
deactivate Database

AnalyticsService --> PlatformUI : Return download counts to UI
deactivate AnalyticsService

PlatformUI --> Consumer : Display download counts next to packages
deactivate PlatformUI

```

This sequence diagram follows these steps:
1. The Consumer searches for data packages through the Platform's User Interface (UI).
2. The UI queries the Database to get a list of available data packages.
3. The Database returns the list to the PlatformUI, which then displays it to the Consumer.
4. The Consumer requests to see the download counts for these data packages.
5. The PlatformUI asks an Analytics Service to fetch the download counts for these packages.
6. The Analytics Service retrieves the download statistics for each package from the Database.
7. The Database sends these statistics to the AnalyticsService.
8. The AnalyticsService processes the statistics and returns the download counts to the PlatformUI.
9. The PlatformUI displays these download counts next to the respective data packages for the Consumer.

Please note, in practice, the details can slightly vary based on the actual system architecture, database schema, and analytics tool used. This diagram provides a general overview of the process based on the project description provided.

To visualize the user story of a collection curator wanting to canonically identify authors and creators of items in the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) by unique identifier, let's map out the sequence of interactions. The primary goal here is to show how the curator can associate a unique identifier (such as an ORCID iD) with authors and creators for easier aggregation of their works.

Below is a PlantUML code to depict this sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Curator as curator
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Author Management\nModule" as authorModule
participant "Database" as DB

== Author Identification Process ==

curator -> UI : Select item to update author details
UI -> authorModule : Trigger author update process
activate authorModule

authorModule -> DB : Retrieve item details
activate DB
DB --> authorModule : Item details
deactivate DB

authorModule --> UI : Display current author(s)
curator -> UI : Input unique identifier (e.g. ORCID) for author(s)
UI -> authorModule : Provide unique identifier(s)
activate DB
authorModule -> DB : Update author details with identifier
DB --> authorModule : Confirmation of update
deactivate DB
authorModule --> UI : Display update success message
deactivate authorModule
UI --> curator : Show success message

== End ==
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Curator** initiates the process by selecting the item(s) they want to update with author details through the **UI Interface**.
2. The **UI Interface** communicates the curator's action to the **Author Management Module**, triggering the author update process.
3. The **Author Management Module** requests the item details from the **Database** to present the current author(s) associated with the item.
4. After receiving the item details, the Author Management Module conveys this information back to the **UI Interface**, which then displays the current author(s) to the curator.
5. The **Curator** inputs the unique identifiers (such as ORCID iDs) for the author(s) through the **UI Interface**.
6. The **UI Interface** sends these identifiers to the **Author Management Module**, which then updates the author details within the **Database**.
7. Upon successful update, the Database sends a confirmation back to the Author Management Module, which then informs the **UI Interface** to display a success message to the **Curator**.

This sequence encapsulates how a curator could easily add unique identifiers to authors and creators within the EDRMS, facilitating an efficient means to view all works associated with a specific individual.

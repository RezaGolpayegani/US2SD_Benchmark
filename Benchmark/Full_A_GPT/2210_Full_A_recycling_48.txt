Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves outlining the specific interactions between the user, the RecycleSmart platform, and potentially third-party services such as database systems. Below is a PlantUML code to represent these interactions.

The user story you provided is: "As a user, I want to be able to browse through the list of facilities and see which ones are environment-friendly, so that I can know for sure my waste is not going to leave a negative ecological footprint."

Here's how the sequence diagram in PlantUML could be structured:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web Interface" as Interface
participant "RecycleSmart Server" as Server
database "Recycling Centers DB" as DB

User -> Interface : Enter search criteria\n(e.g., "environment-friendly")
Interface -> Server : Request list of eco-friendly facilities
Server -> DB : Query facilities by eco-friendly criteria
DB --> Server : Return results
Server --> Interface : Display eco-friendly facilities
Interface --> User : User views \neco-friendly facilities

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the following steps:
1. **User**: Initiates the process by entering search criteria (for instance, filtering facilities by eco-friendly tags or certifications) through the web interface.
  
2. **Web Interface**: The user's request is sent to the RecycleSmart server, asking for a list of recycling facilities that are labeled as environment-friendly.
  
3. **RecycleSmart Server**: Interprets the request and formulates a query for the database to extract information on eco-friendly facilities.
   
4. **Recycling Centers DB**: The database processes the query and returns a list of facilities that match the criteria set by the user, focusing on those that are certified or recognized for their environmentally friendly practices.
   
5. **RecycleSmart Server**: Receives the results from the database and sends this information back to the web interface.
   
6. **Web Interface**: Presents the list of eco-friendly recycling facilities to the user, allowing them to view and select based on their preference for environmentally sustainable operations.

Keep in mind, the actual interactions could be more complex depending on the system's architecture and the level of detail you want to include in your analysis. This template offers a starting point that captures the essence of the user story you're focusing on.

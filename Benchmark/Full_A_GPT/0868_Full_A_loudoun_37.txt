This sequence diagram starts with the Applicant logging into the Customer Portal User Account, progressing through selecting and submitting a request for a plan review meeting, and concludes with receiving the meeting details. It encapsulates interactions among the Applicant, the Customer Portal's Pre-Application Assistance Module, Staff Administrative Tools, and the Plan Review Staff.

For visualization and modification, this diagram should be used with a tool or editor that supports PlantUML.

Given the requirements in your project description for the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) and focusing on the user story related to a Digital Records Archivist wanting a batch ingestion method for Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) received from ProQuest, below is a PlantUML sequence diagram illustrating the process. This sequence diagram demonstrates the interactions between the archivist, the EDRMS, and external systems like ProQuest, highlighting the major steps involved in the batch ingestion process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant "EDRMS Interface" as UI
participant "Ingestion Module" as Ingest
participant "ProQuest API" as PQAPI
participant "Repository DB" as RepoDB
participant "Audit & Logging" as Audit

== Batch Ingestion Process for ETDs ==

Archivist -> UI: Initiate batch ingest request
UI -> Ingest: Validate request
activate Ingest

Ingest -> PQAPI: Request ETDs
activate PQAPI
PQAPI -> Ingest: Return ETD batch
deactivate PQAPI

Ingest -> Ingest: Process ETDs
activate Ingest
Ingest -> RepoDB: Store ETDs metadata & files
activate RepoDB

RepoDB -> Ingest: Confirm storage
deactivate RepoDB
Ingest -> Audit: Log ingest activity
activate Audit
Audit -> Ingest: Confirm logging
deactivate Audit

deactivate Ingest
Ingest -> UI: Display ingest confirmation
UI -> Archivist: Show confirmation & summary

To implement this diagram:

1. **Initiate Batch Ingest**: The process starts with the Archivist initiating a batch ingestion request through the EDRMS user interface.

2. **Validate Request**: The EDRMS checks the request for completeness and authenticity.

3. **Request ETDs from ProQuest**: The system, through its ingestion module, interacts with the ProQuest API to request the batch of ETDs.

4. **ProQuest Response**: ProQuest returns the batch of ETDs including metadata and files to the EDRMS.

5. **Process ETDs**: The EDRMS processes each ETD, which involves parsing, validation, and preparation for storage.

6. **Store ETDs**: The processed ETDs are stored in the repository's database, including both metadata and files.

7. **Confirmation of Storage**: The repository database confirms the successful storage of ETDs.

8. **Log Activity**: The ingestion module logs the activity in an audit and logging service, capturing details of the batch ingest process.

9. **Ingest Confirmation**: Upon successful ingestion and logging, the EDRMS interface communicates back to the Archivist, displaying confirmation and a summary of the ingested ETDs.

This sequence diagram outlines a clear process flow for batch ingesting ETDs from ProQuest, ensuring that each step from initiation to confirmation is accounted for and systematic, enhancing the EDRMS's functionality and reliability in managing digital records efficiently.

To depict the process of a site administrator setting the annual fees for members, Practitioners, and Trainers in a Sequence Diagram using PlantUML, the key interactions between the user (the site administrator) and the system need to be illustrated. The diagram will capture the essential steps: initiating the fee setting process, retrieving current fee settings, updating the fees, and confirming the update. This is a simplified version to give you a starting point, and depending on the specifics of your system architecture, more detail can be added.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Administrator as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Fee Management\nModule" as feeManagement
database "Fee Settings\nDatabase" as feeDB

== Set Annual Fees for Members, Practitioners, and Trainers ==

admin -> dashboard : Navigate to Fee\nManagement Section
dashboard -> feeManagement : Open Fee Management
feeManagement -> feeDB : Retrieve current fees
feeDB -> feeManagement : Current fees data
feeManagement -> dashboard : Display current fees

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Administrator and Admin Dashboard**: The sequence begins with the site administrator navigating to the Fee Management section within the Admin Dashboard. This action initiates the process of setting the annual fees.

2. **Admin Dashboard to Fee Management Module**: The dashboard communicates with the Fee Management Module to open and handle the actual fee setting operations.

3. **Fee Management Module and Fee Settings Database**: The module interacts with the Fee Settings Database to retrieve the current settings for members, Practitioners, and Trainers' fees. This ensures the administrator can see the existing fee structure before making any changes.

4. **Updating the Fees**: The administrator inputs the new fees for members, Practitioners, and Trainers through the dashboard. The updated fees are then submitted to the Fee Management Module.

5. **Fee Management Module Updates Database**: The Fee Management Module processes the new fees and updates them in the database. Upon successful update, a confirmation is sent back to the module.

6. **Confirmation to Administrator**: Finally, the administrator is shown a success message, indicating the fees have been updated.

This diagram focuses on the interactions and flow of information without diving into the technical details of how each component implements its functionality, which allows for a clear overview of the user story related to setting annual fees.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story, "As a manager, I want to be able to edit customer orders," involves visualizing how different system components and actors interact to accomplish order editing. Here is a PlantUML code snippet that illustrates this interaction.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> MI : Request to edit order
activate MI
MI -> OMS : Retrieve order details
activate OMS
OMS -> DB : Query order info
activate DB
DB -> OMS : Return order info
deactivate DB
OMS -> MI : Display order details
deactivate OMS
M -> MI : Provides new order details
MI -> OMS : Send updated order info
activate OMS
OMS -> DB : Update order in DB
activate DB
DB --> OMS : Confirmation of update
deactivate DB
OMS --> MI : Confirm order updated
deactivate OMS
MI --> M : Display success message
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

Description of the interactions in the diagram:

1. The manager requests to edit an order through the Management Interface.
2. The Management Interface forwards this request to the Order Management System to retrieve the current details of the order.
3. The Order Management System queries the Database for the specified order's information.
4. The Database returns the requested order information to the Order Management System.
5. The Order Management System then sends this information back to the Management Interface, where it is displayed to the manager.
6. The manager inputs the new order details into the Management Interface.
7. The Management Interface forwards these updated order details to the Order Management System.
8. The Order Management System updates the order in the Database with the provided information.
9. The Database confirms the update to the Order Management System.
10. The Order Management System confirms to the Management Interface that the order has been updated.
11. Finally, the Management Interface displays a success message to the manager, confirming that the order update process is complete.

This sequence diagram outlines the basic interactions required for a manager to edit an order within a Restaurant Management and Operations System. Each step in the sequence ensures that order changes are accurately captured and stored, maintaining data integrity and reflecting the manager's adjustments promptly.

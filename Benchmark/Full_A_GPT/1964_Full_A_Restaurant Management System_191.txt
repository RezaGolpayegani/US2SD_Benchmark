To address your request, I will create an outline for a sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This diagram will illustrate the sequence of interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System when a manager wants to view the estimated remaining time for products in the storage.

Given the complexity of the interaction for this user story, we'll assume the system performs the following steps:

1. The Manager queries the system through a dashboard/interface to see the estimated remaining time for products in storage.
2. The system calculates the remaining time based on current inventory levels and usage patterns.
3. The system fetches data from the Inventory Management component and the Usage Analytics component.
4. The system then processes this data to estimate the remaining time.
5. Finally, the system displays the estimated remaining time on the dashboard/interface for the Manager.

Here's how you can represent this sequence of interactions in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as mgr
participant "Dashboard Interface" as dashboard
participant "Inventory Management" as inventory
participant "Usage Analytics" as analytics
participant "Storage Estimates Processor" as processor

mgr -> dashboard : Requests remaining time for products
dashboard -> inventory : Fetches current inventory levels
activate inventory
inventory --> dashboard : Returns inventory data
dashboard -> analytics : Requests usage patterns
activate analytics
analytics --> dashboard : Returns usage data
dashboard -> processor : Sends inventory and usage data
activate processor
processor -> processor : Calculates estimated remaining times
processor --> dashboard : Returns remaining time estimates
dashboard -> mgr : Displays estimated remaining times

To visualize this sequence diagram, you need to run this PlantUML code in an environment that supports PlantUML rendering, such as an online PlantUML editor, or integrated development environments (IDEs) with PlantUML plugins/extensions.

This diagram simplifies complex backend processes involved in calculating the estimated remaining time for products in storage, focusing on the sequence of interactions from the manager's request to the final display of information.

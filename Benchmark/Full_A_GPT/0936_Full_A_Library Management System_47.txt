To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to determine long tail books, so I can pull out less valuable books from the public collection," we consider key interactions such as querying the database for book usage statistics, analyzing the data to identify long tail books, and initiating actions based on the analysis. Below is a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format that captures these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant WebInterface
participant BackendSystem
participant Database

Librarian -> WebInterface: Accesses analysis tool for book stats
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> BackendSystem: Request book usage data
activate BackendSystem

BackendSystem -> Database: Query for book borrowing statistics
activate Database

Database --> BackendSystem: Return statistics data
deactivate Database

Backend"yes" then
BackendSystem -> Backend":Using stats data"
System: Analyze data to identify long tail books
activate BackendSystem

BackendSystem --> WebInterface: Display list of long tail books
deactivate BackendSystem

WebInterface --> Librarian: Show long tail books analysis
deactivate WebInterface

Librarian -> WebInterface: Select books to decommission
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> BackendSystem: Mark selected books for removal
activate BackendSystem

BackendSystem -> Database: Update book status to 'Decommissioned'
activate Database

Database --> BackendSystem: Confirm update
deactivate Database

BackendSystem --> WebInterface: Confirm books are marked for removal
deactivate BackendSystem

WebInterface --> Librarian: Display confirmation of decommissioned books
deactivate WebInterface

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow from the librarian's initial request to identify long tail books (books that are less frequently borrowed and thus considered for removal from the collection) through the system's backend logic to analyze borrowing statistics and mark certain books for decomissioning. Each participant (Librarian, Web Interface, Backend System, and Database) plays a critical role in accomplishing the librarian's goal, with multiple steps involving data request, processing, and updates to the book status.

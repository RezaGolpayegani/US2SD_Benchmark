Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting the interactions between the data manager and other components of the DMPTool system to fulfill the requirement of identifying data types and determining required support services and functionalities. Due to the complexity of PlantUML syntax and the limitations of a text-based response, below is a simplified example of how you might represent this process in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager as DM
participant "DMPTool Interface" as UI
database "Metadata Repository" as MR
participant "Support Services Module" as SSM

DM -> UI : Requests data type information
UI -> MR : Queries stored projects metadata
MR -> UI : Returns metadata including data types
UI -> DM : Displays data types
DM -> UI : Selects data type
UI -> SSM : Queries required support\nservices for selected data type
SSM -> UI : Returns list of basic\nsupport services and functionalities
UI -> DM : Displays support services\nand functionalities
DM -> UI : Confirms understanding\nand requirements
UI -> MR : Logs interaction and\nrequirements confirmation

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Data Manager (DM) interacting with the DMPTool Interface (UI) to request information on data types stored within the system. The UI queries the Metadata Repository (MR) for projects metadata, which contains details about the data types. The MR returns this metadata to the UI, which then displays the information to the DM. The DM selects a data type to inquire about, and the UI queries a Support Services Module (SSM) to determine what basic support services and functionalities are tied to that data type. The SSM provides a list, and the UI displays this to the DM. Finally, the DM confirms their understanding and requirements, and the UI logs this interaction and confirmation in the MR.

This sequence diagram is a basic visualization and can be expanded with more specific interactions, alternative paths (for example, if the data type is not yet determined), detailed actor interactions (e.g., IT staff, repository owners), or error handling routines. It's important to adapt and refine the sequence diagram based on the specific implementation details and functionality of the DMPTool being developed.

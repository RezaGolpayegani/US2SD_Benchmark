Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story, "As a user, I want to manage the references / papers I have investigated," involves illustrating the interactions between the user, the Neurohub interface, and possibly any integrated third-party services (like Mendeley for reference management) as mentioned in the project description. This will encompass actions such as searching for references, adding new papers, organizing them, and possibly sharing these references with other users or groups within the Neurohub platform.

Given the constraints of text-based answers, here's a representation in PlantUML format that you can use to generate the sequence diagram. This example assumes interaction with a generic reference management service, which can be adapted to specific third-party tools as per the project specifications.

```plaintext
@startuml
actor User
participant "Neurohub UI" as UI
participant "Reference Manager" as RM
database "Neurohub Database" as DB

== Manage References ==
User -> UI: Access references section
UI -> RM: Fetch references list
RM -> DB: Query saved references
DB --> RM: Return references data
RM --> UI: Display references
UI --> User: Show references list

== Add New Paper ==
User -> UI: Select add new reference
UI -> User: Provide paper details form
User -> UI: Submit paper details
UI --> RM: Validate and store new reference
RM -> DB: Save new reference
DB --> RM: Confirm save
RM --> UI: Confirm addition to the user
UI --> User: Show success message

== Organize References ==
User -> UI: Select organize references
UI --> User: Provide organization options (e.g., folders, tags)
User -> UI: Submit organization changes
UI -> RM: Update organization settings
RM -> DB: Apply changes
DB --> RM: Confirm changes
RM --> UI: Confirm organization update
UI --> User: Show success message

== Share Reference ==
User -> UI: Choose reference to share
UI --> User: Provide share options (e.g., email, group)
User -> UI: Submit share request
UI -> RM: Process share request
RM -> DB: Log share activity
DB --> RM: Confirm logging
RM --> UI: Confirm share action
UI --> MyUser: Show success message

To visualize this PlantUML sequence diagram:

1. **Copy** the above PlantUML code.
2. Navigate to a **PlantUML visualizer** online (such as PlantText.com, or any other PlantUML rendering tool you prefer).
3. **Paste** the copied PlantUML code into the tool.
4. The tool should render the sequence diagram based on the provided code, showcasing the interactions involved in managing references/papers by a user within the Neurohub platform as described.

This diagram serves as an illustrative example. Depending on the actual functionalities, integrations, and workflows within Neurohub, some of the interactions may need adjustments. For a precise and useful sequence diagram, you will need to refine this diagram based on the actual system design and requirements.

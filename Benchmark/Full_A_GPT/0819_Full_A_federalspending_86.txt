Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for representing the process of a data user requesting access to two additional fields from the FPDS data pull involves several steps. The sequence will involve interaction between the data user, the Broker platform's interface, the validation service, and possibly a data service that interacts with the FPDS data source.

Below is a simplified PlantUML code that outlines the sequence of events from when the data user requests the additional FPDS data fields to when the data is finally received. This sequence assumes the addition of these fields requires validation and possibly modification of how FPDS data is pulled into the Broker platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Data User" as user
participant "Broker Interface" as interface
participant "Validation Service" as validation
participant "FPDS Data Service" as fpds
participant "Data Processing Service" as processing

user -> interface : Request additional FPDS fields
interface -> validation : Validate request format and permissions
alt validation success
    validation --> interface : Validation success
    interface -> fpds : Request updated FPDS pull config
    fpds -> processing : Update data pull to include new fields
    processing -> fpds : Confirm update
    fpds --> interface : Confirmation & Data pull initiated
    interface -> processing : Process and import data
    processing -> interface : Processing complete
    interface --> user : Provide access to updated data
else validation failure
    validation --> interface : Validation failure (Error message)
    interface --> user : Display error message
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the "Data User" initiating a request through the "Broker Interface" for two additional fields from the FPDS data pull. The "Broker Interface" then forwards the request to the "Validation Service" to ensure the request is formatted correctly and the user has the necessary permissions.

- If the validation is successful, the process continues with the "Broker Interface" requesting an updated FPDS data pull configuration from the "FPDS Data Service". The "FPDS Data Service" updates the data pull to include the new fields and confirms the update before initiating the data pull. Next, the "Data Processing Service" processes and imports the data, signaling completion back to the "Broker Interface", which in turn provides the data user with access to the updated data.
- If the validation fails, the "Validation Service" sends an error message back to the "Broker Interface", which then displays this message to the data user.

This sequence emphasizes the importance of validation and error handling in the process of accessing additional fields from FPDS data pulls and highlights the interactions between various services that contribute to fulfilling the data user's request within the Broker platform's enhancement project.

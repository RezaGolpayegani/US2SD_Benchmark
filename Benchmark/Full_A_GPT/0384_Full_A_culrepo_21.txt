To create a sequence diagram for the user story in PlantUML format, we'll represent the sequence of interactions between the faculty member, the digital repository system, and possibly other systems or actors involved in the process of notifying a faculty member when their items are downloaded. Note that due to the nature of this text format, actual rendering of the diagram must be done in a PlantUML environment or tool.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant FacultyMember as FM "Faculty Member"
participant "Digital Repository System" as DRS
participant EmailService as ES "Email Notification Service"
participant Database as DB "System Database"

== Item Download Notification Process ==

alt Item Downloaded
    loop Each Download
        activate DRS
        
        DRS -> DB: Check item ownership
        activate DB
        DB --> DRS: Faculty Member ID
        deactivate DB
        
        DRS -> DB: Log download event
        activate DB
        DB --> DRS: Log success
        deactivate DB
        
        DRS -> DRS: Determine if notification setting is ON for Faculty Member
        DRS -> ES: Send download notification
        activate ES
        ES -> FM: Email notification
        deactivate ES
        
        deactivate DRS
    end
else No Download
    DRS --> FM: No action required
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the process triggered when an item or file uploaded by a faculty member is downloaded. The sequence starts with the hypothesis of an item being downloaded, leading to checks and actions within the Digital Repository System (DRS), interactions with the database to check item ownership, and logging of the download event. Assuming notification settings permit, an email notification is sent via an Email Service to inform the faculty member of the download. The alternate path covers the scenario where no download occurs, resulting in no action required. 

To visualize this diagram, you would need to use a PlantUML-compatible tool or editor and might need to adjust the interaction details based on the exact implementation and capabilities of the involved systems.

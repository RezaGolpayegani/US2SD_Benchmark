Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story you've provided involves visualizing the interactions between various system components and the user when they seek information about data DOI (Digital Object Identifier) assignment. Here's a PlantUML code that represents these interactions.

Please note, the sequence diagram assumes the existence of a web interface for the digital repository, a backend server handling the logic, and possibly a database or external service that holds information regarding DOI assignments.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor as depositor
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "DOI Information" as doiDB
participant "Metadata Service" as metadata

depositor -> web : Access DOI Information Page
web -> backend : Request DOI Info
backend -> doiDB : Query DOI Assignment Process
doiDB -> backend : Return DOI Process Info
backend -> metadata : Request Required Metadata Fields
metadata -> backend : Return Metadata Fields
backend -> web : Respond with DOI and Metadata Info
web -> depositor : Display DOI and Metadata Information

note over depositor, metadata : This flow includes querying required\n metadata for DOI assignment and\n presenting it to the Depositor.

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the depositor's action to find information regarding DOI assignment on the digital repository's web interface. It covers the steps from making the request on the web interface to displaying the needed information (DOI assignment process and required metadata) back to the user. This diagram incorporates the interactions among the depositor (user), web interface, backend server, DOI information database/service, and a metadata service that specifies the metadata required for DOI assignment.

To visualize this diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML diagram generation tool or integrated development environment (IDE) plugin that supports PlantUML.

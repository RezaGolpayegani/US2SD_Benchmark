Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the User Story "As a manager, I want to keep track of resources available so that I can manage inventory" involves illustrating the interaction between different system components and stakeholders as they perform the inventory management process. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that depicts this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "Inventory Management System" as IMS
participant Database

Manager -> IMS : Request inventory data
activate IMS
IMS -> Database : Query inventory status
activate Database
Database --> IMS : Return inventory data
deactivate Database
IMS --> Manager : Display inventory data
deactivate IMS

Manager -> IMS : Identify low stock items
activate IMS
IMS -> Database : Query low stock items

Manager -> IMS : Initiate restock order
activate IMS
IMS -> Database : Update inventory order status
activate Database
Database --> IMS : Confirm order updates
deactivate Database
IMS --> Manager : Display updated inventory and pending orders

IMS -> Database : Update inventory levels

This diagram outlines the basic interaction between the manager, the inventory management system (IMS), and the database during the process of managing inventory. It begins with the manager requesting the current inventory status from the IMS, which then queries the database to fetch and display this information back to the manager. The manager can identify items that are low in stock, initiate restock orders, and adjust the inventory based on new deliveries, with each step involving communication with the IMS and updates being reflected in the database.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview and may need to be adjusted or expanded based on specific project requirements, such as integrating with external supplier systems, handling notifications for low stock items, or detailed interactions for approving and tracking delivery schedules.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to update an order so that I can change the order items" involves different actors and components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

Please note, this example might need adjustments or extensions to fit specific project requirements or system architectures. The given sequence diagram text for PlantUML outlines a basic process flow and interaction between the manager, the system interface, backend services, and database. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

manager -> ui : Selects "Orders" option
ui -> server : Request ongoing orders list
server -> db : Query ongoing orders
db -> server : Return ongoing orders
server -> ui : Display ongoing orders
ui -> manager : Show ongoing orders

manager -> ui : Select order to update
ui -> server : Request order details
server -> db : Query order details by ID
db -> server : Return order details
server -> ui : Display order details
ui -> manager : Show order details

manager -> ui : Make changes to order items
ui -> server : Send updated order details
server -> db : Update order in database
db -> server : Confirm order updated
server -> ui : Confirm update success
ui -> manager : Display success message

This sequence diagram starts with the manager selecting the orders option through the user interface (UI), requesting the ongoing orders list, selecting an order to update, making changes to the order items, and the system updating the order in the database.

Keep in mind, the actual implementation can have more complexities such as error handling, authentication and authorization checks (ensuring the manager has the rights to update orders), and interactions with other components for inventory checks (to ensure the requested changes can be fulfilled based on current stock levels) that are not detailed in this simple sequence diagram. 

Additionally, depending on the specifics of the implementation, there could be interactions with a caching layer to improve performance, or with third-party services for notifying customers about changes to their orders, which are not covered here.

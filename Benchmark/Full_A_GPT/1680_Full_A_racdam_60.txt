Creating a sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML requires detailing the interactions between the user (archivist) and the system components during the process of browsing through files in a collection. This example will provide an outline of such interactions focused on accessing, filtering, and viewing files within a digital archive management system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Search/Filter Engine" as searchEngine
database "Digital Archive Database" as database

== Browsing Files in a Collection ==
archivist -> web: Access collection browsing feature
activate web

web -> searchEngine: Request list of collections
activate searchEngine

searchEngine -> database: Retrieve collections
activate database
database --> searchEngine: Collections data
deactivate database

searchEngine --> web: Collections list
deactivate searchEngine

web --> archivist: Display collections
deactivate web

archivist -> web: Select a collection
activate web

web -> searchEngine: Request files in collection
activate searchEngine

searchEngine -> database: Retrieve files metadata
activate database
database --> searchEngine: Files data
deactivate database

searchEngine --> web: Files list and metadata
deactivate searchEngine

web --> archivist: Display files in collection
deactivate web

archivist -> web: Choose file to view details
activate web

web -> searchEngine: Request file details
activate searchSearch

searchEngine -> database: Retrieve file details
activate database
database --> searchEngine: File details
deactivate database

searchEngine --> web: File details
deactivate searchEngine

web --> archivist: Display file details
deactivate web

This sequence diagram focuses on the flow from the archivist's perspective of browsing through files within a collection, selecting a collection, viewing the list of files, and then viewing details of a specific file. Note that interactions like authentication, more specific error handling, and other potential system interactions (e.g., logging or analytics) are omitted for clarity and brevity. This diagram assumes a straightforward interaction model without considering potential complexities like pagination, advanced searching/filtering criteria, or real-time updates to the database.

To run this diagram, make sure you have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor. The syntax provided is designed to be compatible with standard PlantUML interpreters, offering a visual representation of the sequences involved when an archivist browses through files in a collection.

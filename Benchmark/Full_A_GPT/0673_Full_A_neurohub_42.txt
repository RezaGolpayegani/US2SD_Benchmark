Given the project and the user story, let's create a sequence diagram in PlantUML to visualize how a user can view the evolution of an experimental protocol over time within the Neurohub platform. This sequence will typically involve interactions between the user, the system interface, a database or storage system managing the experimental protocols, and potentially other systems for version control or history tracking.

Please note the actual implementation may vary based on the specific technologies and architecture of your Neurohub platform. The sequence below provides a high-level overview tailored to the project description provided.

```plantuml

@startuml
actor User
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Protocol Service" as PS
database "Protocol Database" as DB
participant "Version Control" as VC

== Viewing Protocol Evolution ==

User -> UI : Requests protocol history
UI -> PS : Fetch protocol version history
PS -> DB : Query for protocol versions
DB --> PS : Return protocol versions
PS -> VC : Request detailed change log
VC --> PS : Return change log
PS --> UI : Display protocol evolution
UI --> User : Shows protocol history and evolution

@endurml
```
This sequence diagram outlines the following process:

1. The user requests to view the protocol history through the Neurohub web interface.
2. The web interface forwards this request to the Protocol Service, which is responsible for managing experimental protocols.
3. The Protocol Service queries the Protocol Database to fetch all available versions of the requested protocol.
4. The database returns the list of protocol versions to the Protocol Service.
5. The Protocol Service requests a detailed change log from the Version Control system; this could involve integration with systems like Git if protocols are tracked using a version control system.
6. The Version Control system sends back the detailed change log to the Protocol Service.
7. The Protocol Service compiles the information and sends it back to the web interface.
8. Finally, the web interface displays the protocol's evolution over time to the user, including version differences, comments, and timestamps of changes.

This diagram provides a high-level abstract view. Depending on the specific requirements and existing infrastructure of the Neurohub platform, additional steps or different interactions might be necessary.

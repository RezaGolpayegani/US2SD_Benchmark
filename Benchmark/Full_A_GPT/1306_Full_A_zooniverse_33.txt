Given your requirement, drawing out a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story around automatic animal species preclassification for Snapshot Serengeti in the Zooniverse platform would involve outlining the interactions between different system components. PlantUML is a tool that allows you to create diagrams using a simple and intuitive language.

Below is an example sequence diagram expressed in PlantUML syntax. This example assumes the Zooniverse admin will trigger a species preclassification process on an uploaded image, and the system will utilize AI/ML models to perform the task.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Zooniverse Admin" as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Preclassification Service" as preclass
participant "AI/ML Model" as model
participant "Database" as db

admin -> dashboard : select image for preclassification
dashboard -> preclass : initiate preclassification
activate preclass

preclass -> model : send image for processing
activate model
model -> model : analyze image
model --> preclass : return species data
deactivate model

preclass -> db : update image metadata with species data
activate db
db --> preclass : confirm update
deactivate db

preclass --> dashboard : display preclassification results
deactivate preclass
dashboard --> admin : show results

```
This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. The Zooniverse admin selects an image for preclassification via the Admin Dashboard.
2. The Admin Dashboard initiates the preclassification process by sending a request to the Preclassification Service.
3. The Preclassification Service forwards the image to an AI/ML Model specialized in analyzing the image to predict the animal species.
4. The AI/ML Model processes the image to detect and classify animal species and returns the identified species data back to the Preclassification Service.
5. The Preclassification Service updates the image metadata in the Database with the new species data.
6. The Database confirms the metadata update back to the Preclassification Service.
7. Finally, the Preclassification Service returns the preclassification results to the Admin Dashboard, which displays them to the Zooniverse admin.

This diagram is a simplified version of the processes that could be involved in the preclassification of animal species within the AMIDP platform, specifically tailored for Zooniverse admins working on the Snapshot Serengeti project. The actual implementation could involve more detailed interactions based on specific project requirements, the complexity of the AI/ML models, and the architecture of the AMIDP platform.

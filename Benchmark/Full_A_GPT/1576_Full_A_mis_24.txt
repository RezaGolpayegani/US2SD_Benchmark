Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML requires breaking down the interactions between the archivist, the batch ingest tool, and other components of the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) such as the database or storage system and the permissions management subsystem. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Archivist as archivist
participant "Batch Ingest Tool" as batchTool
database "Repository Database" as repoDB
participant "Permissions System" as permSystem
participant "Storage System" as storage

archivist -> batchTool : Upload files & metadata with embargo info
activate batchTool

batchTool -> repoDB : Check for existing records
activate repoDB
repoDB --> batchTool : Return results
deactivate repoDB

batchTool -> batchTool : Determine new entries
batchTool -> storage : Store files
activate storage
storage --> batchTool : Confirm storage
deactivate storage

batchTool -> permSystem : Set metadata viewing to everyone
activate permSystem
permSystem --> batchTool : Metadata permissions set
batchTool -> permSystem : Set file download perms for curators & admins
permSystem --> batchTool : File permissions set
deactivate permSystem

batchTool -> repoDB : Update database with files, metadata, and permissions
activate repoDB
repoDB --> batchTool : Database updated
deactivate repoDB

batchTool --> archivist : Confirm ingest & embargo settings
deactivate batchTool

### Explanation:

- **Archivist to Batch Ingest Tool**: The digital records archivist uploads the files and corresponding metadata, including embargo information, to the batch ingest tool.
- **Batch Ingest Tool to Repository Database**: The tool checks the repository database for existing records to avoid duplicates.
- **Determination and Storage**: After determining the new entries, the batch ingest tool stores the files in the repository's storage system.
- **Permissions Setting**: The tool sets up the permissions for the uploaded items based on the given requirements:
  - Metadata viewing permissions are set to everyone.
  - File download permissions are restricted to collection curators and repository administrators.
- **Repository Database Update**: The batch ingest tool updates the repository database with the newly stored files, their metadata, and the configured permissions.
- **Confirmation to Archivist**: Finally, the batch ingest tool confirms the successful ingest and embargo settings application to the archivist.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of how the batch ingest tool processes files and metadata with embargo restrictions, managing permissions accordingly within the EDRMS.

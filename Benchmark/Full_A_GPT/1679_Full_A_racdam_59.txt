Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a researcher, I want to browse through files in a collection." using PlantUML notation involves outlining the interaction between the user (researcher) and the system components involved in browsing files within a collection. The sequence diagram will include the steps taken from the moment the researcher initiates the action to browse files until the system displays the desired content.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as Res
participant "UI: Web Interface" as UI
participant "SearchController" as SC
participant "CollectionService" as CS
participant "FileService" as FS
database "DigitalArchiveDB" as DB

Res -> UI: Access digital archive
activate UI

UI -> SC: Request to browse collection
activate SC

SC -> CS: Retrieve collection list
activate CS

CS -> DB: Query available collections
activate DB

DB --> CS: Return collections
deactivate DB

CS --> SC: Collections list
deactivate CS

SC -> FS: Request files in collection
activate FS

FS -> DB: Query files in specified collection
activate DB

DB --> FS: Return files
deactivate DB

FS --> SC: Collection files
deactivate FS

SC --> UI: Display files to researcher
deactivate SC

UI --> Res: Show files in UI
deactivate UI

### Explanation:

1. **Researcher (Actor)**: Initiates the browsing process by accessing the digital archive's web interface.
2. **UI: Web Interface (Participant)**: The front-end through which the researcher interacts with the system.
3. **SearchController (Participant)**: Manages the requests related to searching and browsing functionalities.
4. **CollectionService (Participant)**: Handles operations related to collections such as retrieving the list of available collections.
5. **FileService (Participant)**: Manages the retrieval and processing of files within a specified collection.
6. **DigitalArchiveDB (Database)**: The database where the collections and files data are stored.

### Flow:

- The **Researcher** accesses the digital archive through the **Web Interface**.
- The researcher requests to browse a collection, and this request is passed to the **SearchController**.
- The **SearchController** asks the **CollectionService** to retrieve a list of available collections.
- The **CollectionService** queries the **DigitalArchiveDB** for the available collections and returns the list to the **SearchController**.
- Once the researcher selects a collection, the **SearchController** requests the **FileService** to retrieve the files within the selected collection.
- The **FileService** queries the **DigitalArchiveDB** to return the files belonging to the specified collection.
- The **SearchController** then receives the collection files' details and instructs the **UI** to display these files to the researcher.
- The **Researcher** is presented with the files in the collection through the **Web Interface** for browsing.

This sequence diagram focuses on the interaction and flow of data between the system's components specifically for browsing files within a digital archive collection from a researcherâ€™s perspective.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram detailing the interaction sequence for a data reuser examining and identifying deposited files to assess their usefulness without downloading the entire dataset. This diagram assumes the presence of a web interface, a backend service managing dataset information, and a database storing dataset details such as metadata and file information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Reuser" as reuser
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Service" as backend
database "Dataset Database" as db

reuser -> web : Request dataset listings
web -> backend : Fetch dataset summaries
backend -> db : Query dataset metadata and file lists
db --> backend : Return dataset metadata and file lists
backend --> web : Display dataset summaries with file lists
web --> reuser : Show datasets and downloadable files preview
reuser -> web : Select dataset for preview
web -> backend : Request dataset file structure and summary
backend -> db : Query selected dataset details
db --> backend : Return selected dataset details
backend --> web : Send dataset file structure and summary
web --> reuser : Display dataset structure and file summary\n(without downloading entire dataset)

This sequence diagram starts with the data reuser requesting dataset listings through a web interface. The web interface then communicates with a backend service to fetch dataset summaries, which includes making a query to the dataset database for metadata and file lists. The database returns this information to the backend service, which then provides the data to the web interface to display to the data reuser.

Upon displaying the dataset summaries, the reuser can select a specific dataset for preview. The web interface sends a request for the dataset file structure and summary to the backend service, which queries the selected dataset details from the database. Once the backend service receives these details, it sends the dataset file structure and summary back to the web interface, which then displays it to the reuser, allowing them to make a preliminary assessment of the dataset's usefulness without the need to download the entire dataset.

This diagram simplifies complex interactions into a straightforward sequence and assumes that error handling and security measures are in place but not explicitly shown for clarity.

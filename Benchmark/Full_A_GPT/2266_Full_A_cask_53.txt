Certainly! Below is a detailed PlantUML code snippet to represent the sequence diagram for the described user story: "As an app developer, I want to ensure that application creation fails if any of its datasets cannot be created."

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AppDeveloper as developer
participant AppDeploymentService as deployService
participant DatasetManagementService as datasetService
participant Database as db

developer -> deployService : Deploy Application Request
activate deployService

deployService -> datasetService : Validate Datasets Creation
activate datasetService

loop For Each Dataset
    datasetService -> db : Create Dataset Instance
    db -> datasetService : Dataset Creation Status
    alt Dataset Creation Failed
        datasetService -> deployService : Dataset Creation Failed 
        deployService -> developer : Application Deployment Failed
        deactivate datasetService
        deactivate deployService
        return
    end
end

datasetService -> deployService : All Datasets Validated Successfully
deactivate datasetService

deployService -> db : Create Application Instance
db -> deployService : Application Creation Status

deployService -> developer : Application Deployment Success
deactivate deployService

```

This sequence diagram begins with the app developer initiating an application deployment request. The deployment service then requests dataset validation from the dataset management service, which, in turn, attempts to create each dataset instance in the database. If any dataset instance creation fails, the dataset management service immediately informs the deployment service, which then notifies the app developer that the application deployment has failed because a dataset could not be created. If all dataset instances are successfully validated and created, the deployment service proceeds to create the application instance in the database and, upon success, notifies the app developer that the application has been deployed successfully.

Please ensure you have PlantUML or an appropriate plugin/tool that supports PlantUML installed to visualize this sequence diagram. This tool generates diagrams from textual descriptions, making it suitable for quick iterations during software design phases.

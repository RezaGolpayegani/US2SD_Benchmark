To illustrate the user story of an applicant wanting to resubmit plans for review in the County Services & Property Information Portal, the following is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram representation. Given the complexity of the system, the sequence diagram highlights the key interactions between the applicant, the portal interface, system components, and backend services necessary for resubmitting and reviewing revised plans.

Please note that this sequence diagram assumes a user-friendly interface and division of backend services into Authentication, User Account Management, Application Processing, Plan Review, and Notifications. Here is a textual depiction to be converted into PlantUML code:

This diagram starts with the Applicant initiating a resubmission request through the Portal Interface, which then proceeds through a series of steps involving validation, account retrieval, application status checks, and the eventual resubmission of revised plans. The sequence concludes with the processing of these plans and the issuance of a notification to the applicant regarding the resubmission's outcome.

The depicted sequence simplifies the interactions for clarity, focusing on the primary steps involved in the plan resubmission process. Depending on the portal's real implementation details and requirements, additional steps, decision points, or services may be incorporated.

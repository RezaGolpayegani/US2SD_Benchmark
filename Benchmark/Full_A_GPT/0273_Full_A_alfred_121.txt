Given your request, let's create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that represents the process a developer would go through to create and maintain their applications within the ALFRED marketplace. The sequence will cover the core interactions including logging in, creating a new app, submitting it for approval, receiving feedback, updating an app, and managing app versions.

Please note, this sequence diagram is a high-level representation and might need adjustments based on specific project requirements or technical constraints. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
entity "Developer Portal" as Portal
entity "API Gateway" as API
database "App Store Database" as Database
entity "Review System" as Review

Developer -> Portal : Navigate to Developer Portal
Portal -> Developer : Display Login Page

This diagram begins with the developer logging into the ALFRED Developer Portal and goes through the process of creating, submitting, and updating an app on the marketplace. Each step illustrates the system's components interacting with one another, culminating in both the initial approval of a new app and subsequent updates to it.

Remember, the specifics such as the platform's architecture, security measures for authentication, and detailed review processes can affect how this sequence operates in a real-world scenario. This example assumes a straightforward process for the sake of clarity.

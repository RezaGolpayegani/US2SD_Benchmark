Given the complexity and multifaceted aspects of the system described in your project overview, a sequence diagram focusing on the user story "As a cook, I want to view reports on product storage data" could involve several system components including the user interface, backend services, and database interactions.

Below is an example sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates this process. Note that for simplicity, some details are abstracted, and error handling is not explicitly shown. The focus is on the primary flow of actions when a cook requests to view product storage data reports.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook as C
participant Frontend as F
participant Backend as B
participant Database as DB

C -> F : Select "View Storage Reports"
activate F
F -> B : Request storage data reports
activate B

B -> DB : Query product storage data
activate DB
DB --> B : Return storage data
deactivate DB

B -> B : Generate storage report
B --> F : Send storage reports
deactivate B

F --> C : Display storage reports
deactivate F
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram steps:

1. **Cook selects "View Storage Reports"**: This is the initial interaction where the cook, through the user interface (presumably a web or mobile application), selects the option to view reports related to product storage.

2. **Frontend requests storage data reports**: The frontend application sends a request to the backend/server to retrieve the necessary product storage data for report generation.

3. **Backend queries product storage data**: The backend application communicates with the database to fetch the data related to product storage. This could involve querying multiple tables or collections (e.g., products, stock levels, supplier information, etc.).

4. **Database returns product storage data**: The database processes the backendâ€™s query and returns the relevant product storage data.

5. **Backend generates storage report**: With the data received from the database, the backend processes it to generate a comprehensive storage report. This step might involve calculating stock turnover rates, forecasting stock-out dates, identifying products nearing their expiry dates, and other relevant metrics.

6. **Backend sends storage reports to the frontend**: The generated report is sent back to the frontend application.

7. **Frontend displays storage reports to the cook**: Finally, the cook can view the storage reports on their device. This could be in the form of tables, charts, or any data visualizations supported by the frontend technology stack.

Remember, this sequence diagram is a high-level depiction. Depending on specific project requirements, additional details such as authentication, error handling, and specific data manipulation steps can be included for a more comprehensive design.

Given the nature of your request, translating the specified user story into a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax involves illustrating interactions between different entities such as the team member, design team, research data, and potentially a prototype feedback loop. Here's a proposed sequence diagram that reflects these transactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant TeamMember as TM
participant DesignTeam as DT
participant ResearchData as RD
participant Prototype as P
participant Feedback as F

TM -> DT : Request design direction options
DT -> RD : Review research data
RD --> DT : Provide user preferences & trends
DT -> DT : Create initial design concepts
DT -> P : Develop prototype based on concepts
P -> F : Conduct usability testing
F --> DT : Deliver usability feedback
DT -> DT : Refine design based on feedback
DT -> TM : Present finalized design direction
TM -> TM : Approve design direction

```

This diagram starts with the Team Member requesting design direction options from the Design Team, which in turns reviews existing research data to understand user preferences and trends. The Design Team then creates initial design concepts, which are used to develop a prototype. This prototype undergoes usability testing, and the feedback received informs further refinements of the design. Finally, the Design Team presents the finalized design direction to the Team Member for approval.

Remember, this PlantUML sequence diagram is a high-level representation. The actual interactions could be more complex based on the detail of your research data, number and type of design concepts explored, depth of usability testing, and refinement cycles. Adjustments may be required to fit the specific processes and decision-making steps of your team and project scope.

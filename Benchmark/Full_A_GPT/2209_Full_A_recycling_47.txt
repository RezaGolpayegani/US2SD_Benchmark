Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interaction between the admin, the RecycleSmart platform, and the recycling facilities. The user story emphasizes direct communication from the admin to the facilities, which can be facilitated through the platform's messaging or notification module. For simplicity, let's assume the platform uses a message or notification service for this direct communication. Below is the PlantUML code representing these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin
participant "RecycleSmart \nPlatform" as Platform
participant "Notification \nService" as NotificationService
participant "Facility \nRepresentative" as FacilityRep

== Admin Initiates Communication ==
Admin -> Platform : Access Facility Communication Module
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Authenticate Admin
note right: Verify admin credentials\nto allow access

Platform -> NotificationService : Prepare Communication Interface
activate NotificationService

== Composing Message ==
Admin -> Platform : Compose Message
Platform -> NotificationService : Create New Message
activate NotificationService
NotificationService --> Admin : Display Message Draft Interface
deactivate NotificationService

Admin -> NotificationService : Submit Message Draft + Facility Target Info
activate NotificationService
NotificationService -> NotificationService : Validate Message and Facility Info

== Sending Message ==
NotificationService -> FacilityRep : Dispatch Message
activate FacilityRep
FacilityRep --> Platform : Acknowledge Receipt
deactivate FacilityRep
Platform --> Admin : Confirm Message Delivery
deactivate NotificationMarketingService

== Interaction Ends ==
deactivate Platform

### Sequence Diagram Explanation:

1. **Admin Initiates Communication**: This part of the sequence illustrates the admin logging into the RecycleSmart platform and accessing the facility communication module.

2. **Composing Message**: Here, the admin composes a message intended for a facility. The platform, through its notification service, creates a new message draft and displays an interface for the admin to compose the message.

3. **Sending Message**: After composing the message, the admin submits it along with information about the targeted facility. The notification service validates this information, dispatches the message to the facility representative, and then confirms the delivery to the admin.

This sequence diagram outlines a simple yet effective process for an admin to communicate directly with recycling facilities via a platform's messaging service, promoting efficient updates and interactions concerning website features or other relevant information.

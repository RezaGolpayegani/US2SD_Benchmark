To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story where a librarian wants to create (add) books in the library, we first outline the steps involved in this process:

1. The librarian logs into the CLMS.
2. The librarian selects the option to add a new book.
3. The librarian enters book details in the presented form.
4. The CLMS validates the entered information.
5. CLMS checks for duplicate entries in the database.
6. If no duplicates are found, the system saves the new book details in the database.
7. A confirmation message is sent to the librarian.

Now, let's translate these steps into PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Login Interface" as login
participant "Add Book Interface" as addBook
participant "Validation System" as validation
database "CLMS Database" as db

librarian -> login: Logs into the system
login --> librarian: Authentication Successful

librarian -> addBook: Selects "Add New Book"
addBook -> librarian: Presents book details form
librarian -> addBook: Enters book details and submits

addBook -> validation: Validate book details
validation --> addBook: Validation Success

addBook -> db: Check for duplicate entries
db --> addBook: No duplicates found

addBook -> db: Save new book details
db --> addBook: Book saved successfully

addBook --> librarian: Display confirmation message

This PlantUML sequence diagram describes the process flow from the librarian deciding to add a book, through system validation, to saving the book information in the database, and finally confirming the action's success. You can customize the components and interactions based on specific project needs or additional features you plan to implement.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the User Story "As a collection curator, I want to have a tool to perform author authority control" involves outlining the interactions between different system components and actors to achieve the functionality related to author authority control. Here's how this can be represented in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Curator as curator
participant "Author Authority \n Control Tool" as tool
database "EDRMS Database" as db
participant "External Authority \n Database" as extDb

== Authority Control Process ==
curator -> tool : Request author verification
tool -> db : Query existing author records
alt Author record exists
    db -> tool : Return author details
    tool -> curator : Display author details
else No record found
    tool -> extDb : Query external author authority
    extDb -> tool : Return external author details
    alt Author details found
        db -> tool : Create/Update author record
        tool -> curator : Display new/updated author details
    else No details found
        tool -> curator : Prompt to create new author record
    end
end

```

This sequence diagram starts with the collection curator initiating a request for author verification through an "Author Authority Control Tool," a component of the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS). The tool first queries the EDRMS Database for existing author records. If an author record exists, the details are returned to the curator. If no record is found, the tool queries an external authority database.

If the external database returns author details, the EDRMS Database either creates or updates an author record with these details, which are then displayed to the curator. If no details are found in the external database, the curator is prompted to create a new author record.

This sequence aims to illustrate how author authority control can be automated and streamlined within the EDRMS, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in managing author-related metadata.

Please note: To run this PlantUML code and generate the sequence diagram, you'll need access to a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML diagrams.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided requires envisioning how the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) would enable a legal officer to know about data sensitivity in order to establish sharing options. Hereâ€™s a basic layout in PlantUML format to describe this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LegalOfficer as LO
participant DMPTool as DMPT
participant MetadataTool as MT
participant SecurityModule as SM
participant DataManager as DM

== Understanding Data Sensitiveness ==

LO -> DMPT : Request data sensitivity info
activate DMPT

DMPT -> MT : Extract metadata related to data sensitivity
activate MT
MT --> DMPT : Metadata
deactivate MT

DMPT -> SM : Analyze data sensitivity
activate SM
SM --> DMPT : Sensitivity report
deactivate SM

DMPT -> DM : Request additional details on sensitive data
activate DM
DM --> DMPT : Provides data handling specifics
deactivate DM

DMPT -> SM : Assess security requirements
activate SM
SM --> DMPT : Security assessment
deactivate SM

DMPT --> LO : Display sensitivity info & security recommendations
deactivate DMPT

== Establishing Sharing Options ==

LO -> DMPT : Input desired sharing parameters based on sensitivity
activate DMPT

DMPT -> SM : Determine sharing options
activate SM
SM --> DMPT : Appropriate sharing options
deactivate SM

DMPT --> LO : Recommend sharing options
deactivate DMPT

This sequence diagram starts with the Legal Officer (LO) making a request to the DMPTool (DMPT) for information on data sensitivity. The DMPTool retrieves metadata related to data sensitivity from a Metadata Tool (MT) and then passes this information to its Security Module (SM) for analysis. The Security Module generates a sensitivity report which the DMPTool uses to query a DataManager (DM) for additional data handling specifics. 

Further, the DMPTool assesses the security requirements with the Security Module before displaying the sensitivity information and security recommendations back to the Legal Officer. Based on this information, the Legal Officer submits desired sharing parameters to the DMPTool, which again consults the Security Module to determine appropriate sharing options before recommending these options to the Legal Officer.

This diagram simplifies the interaction process and assumes direct communication between system components and user roles for clarity. Actual implementations might have various layers of interaction and user interface elements to support these functionalities.

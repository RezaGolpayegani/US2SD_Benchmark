Below is a PlantUML script representing a sequence diagram for the User Story: "As a Data User, I want to have the 12-19-2017 deletions processed." This script demonstrates the interactions that might occur between the Data User, the Broker Platform, and other components involved in processing deletions from December 19, 2013.

```plantuml
@startuml

!define RectangleParticipant(participantAlias, participantLabel) participant participantAlias as participantLabel << (R,#ADD1B2) >>

actor "Data User" as User
RectangleParticipant(DB, "Broker Database")
RectangleParticipant(ValEngine, "Validation Engine")
RectangleParticipant(Logging, "Logging System")
RectangleParticipant(NotificationSys, "Notification System")

== Deletion Request by Data User ==

User -> BrokerPlatform : Request deletions\nfrom 12-19-2017
BrokerPlatform -> ValEngine : Initiate data validation\nfor deletion date
activate ValEngine
ValEngine -> DB : Query deletions\nwith specified date
activate DB
DB --> ValEngine : Return deletion\nentries
deactivate DB

ValEngine -> ValEngine : Validate deletion\nentries criteria
ValEngine --> BrokerPlatform : Validated deletions

== Processing Deletions ==
BrokerPlatform -> DB : Process validated\ndeletions
activate DB
DB --> BrokerPlatform : Confirm deletions processed
deactivate DB

BrokerPlatform -> Logging : Log deletion\nactivity
activate Logging
Logging --> BrokerPlatform : Log entry created
deactivate Logging

== Notification ==
BrokerPlatform -> NotificationSys : Notify User of\nsuccessful deletions
activate NotificationSys
NotificationSys -> User : Deletions processed\nemail/notification
deactivate NotificationSys

This diagram outlines the steps taken when a Data User requests deletions for a specific date (12-19-2017 in this case). It includes interactions with a validation engine to ensure the requested deletions meet specific criteria before processing, a logging system for auditing purposes, and a notification system to inform the user of successful processing. The diagram assumes a simplified view; depending on the complexity of the Broker Platform, more components or steps might be involved.

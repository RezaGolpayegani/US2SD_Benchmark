To create a detailed Sequence Diagram using PlantUML for the user story "As a librarian, I want to edit details about books and their locations," you need to outline the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) - specifically, how the librarian interacts with the system to update book details and locations. Below is a simple PlantUML code to illustrate this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library Management \n Interface" as LMI
participant "Book Management \n System" as BMS
participant Database

Librarian -> LMI : Access book editing section
activate LMI

LMI -> BMS : Request book details
activate BMS

BMS -> Database : Query book details
activate Database
Database --> BMS : Return book details
deactivate Database

BMS --> LMI : Show book details
deactivate BMS

LMI --> Librarian : Display book details
Librarian -> LMI : Edit book and location information
activate LMI

LMI -> BMS : Send updated details
activate BMS

BMS -> Database : Update book details and location
activate Database
Database --> BMS : Confirm update success
deactivate Database

BMS --> LMI : Confirm update success
deactivate BMS

LMI --> Librarian : Display update confirmation
deactivate LMI

**Explanation:**

1. **Librarian:** The user who wants to edit book details and locations.
2. **Library Management Interface (LMI):** The frontend interface through which the librarian interacts with the system.
3. **Book Management System (BMS):** A backend component responsible for managing book-related operations, including updating book details and locations.
4. **Database:** Stores all data related to books, including their details and locations.

**Process Flow:**

1. The Librarian accesses the book editing section through the Library Management Interface (LMI).
2. LMI requests the current book details from the Book Management System (BMS).
3. BMS queries the Database for the book's current details.
4. The Database returns the book details to the BMS.
5. BMS passes the book details to the LMI, which displays them to the Librarian.
6. The Librarian edits the book and location information via the LMI.
7. LMI sends the updated details to the BMS.
8. BMS updates the book details and location in the Database.
9. The Database confirms the success of the update to the BMS.
10. BMS confirms the update's success to the LMI.
11. Finally, LMI displays an update confirmation to the Librarian.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow for a librarian to update the details about books and their locations within the Comprehensive Library Management System using PlantUML code format.

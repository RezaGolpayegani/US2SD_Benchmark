Given the request, we'll create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines what occurs when a developer's app crashes on an older adult user's device using ALFRED. This sequence diagram will include interactions between the user's device, ALFRED's core system, the developer's interface, and potentially a monitoring/service desk component.

Please note, the actual code below cannot be executed as this is a representation to guide the creation of a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserDevice as Device
participant ALFREDCore as Core
participant MonitoringService as Monitor
participant DeveloperAPI as API
participant DeveloperInterface as DevInterface

Device -> Core : AppCrashSignal()
activate Core

Core -> Monitor : ReportCrashDetails(AppID, UserID, CrashLog)
activate Monitor
Monitor -> API : NotifyCrash(AppID, CrashLog)
activate API

API -> DevInterface : DisplayCrashInfo(UserID, CrashLog)
activate DevInterface

DevInterface -> Developer : AnalyzeCrash(CrashLog)
activate Developer
Developer -> DevInterface : RequestMoreInfo(UserID)
deactivate Developer

DevInterface -> API : QueryAdditionalData(UserID)
deactivate DevInterface
API -> Monitor : RequestUserConsent(UserID)
deactivate API

Monitor -> UserDevice : PromptUserConsent()
activate UserDevice
UserDevice -> Monitor : ConsentGranted()
deactivate UserDevice

Monitor -> API : UploadAdditionalData(UserID, ExtendedCrashLog)
activate API
API -> DevInterface : AdditionalDataAvailable(ExtendedCrashLog)
activate DevInterface
DevInterface -> Developer : UpdateCrashAnalysis(ExtendedCrashLog)
deactivate DevInterface
deactivate API
deactivate Monitor

This PlantUML diagram represents the sequence of actions initiated after an app crash is detected on a user’s device. Here's a brief walkthrough:

1. An app crash signal (`AppCrashSignal()`) is sent from the user’s device to the ALFRED core system.
2. ALFRED core system reports these crash details, including application identifier and user identifier, along with the crash log, to a Monitoring Service.
3. The Monitoring Service notifies the developer through a Developer API (`NotifyCrash()`), which subsequently triggers a crash information display on the Developer Interface.
4. The developer analyzes the crash information and may request more information about the crash from the user’s device through the Developer Interface.
5. Before acquiring additional data, user consent is prompted through the user’s device by the Monitoring Service.
6. Once consent is granted, additional crash data is uploaded to the Developer API, which then makes it available for the developer, potentially aiding in a more thorough crash analysis.

Be sure to adjust the sequence diagram as needed to fit the specific implementation details and functionalities of the ALFRED system and the developer’s requirements.

Here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on your user story: "As a user, I want to have a visual way of viewing particular files uploaded over a time period." This diagram will map out the sequence of actions from the user's request through the system's processing of that request to present a visual representation of files uploaded over a specified time period.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Visualization Tool" as Visualization

User -> UI : Selects time period for file uploads
UI -> Backend : Request file upload data (start date, end date)
Backend -> DB : Query files by date range
DB --> Backend : Return list of files
Backend -> Visualization : Generate visualization data
Visualization -> Backend : Visualization ready
Backend --> UI : Send visualization
UI --> User : Display file upload visualization

@enduml
```

**Explanation:**
1. **User Interaction**: The User interacts with the Web Interface (UI), providing inputs for the start and end dates of the desired time period for which they want to visualize file uploads.
2. **Processing Request**: The UI sends these details to the Backend System, which then queries the Database for files uploaded within the specified time range.
3. **Database Query**: The Database executes the query and returns a list of files that match the criteria.
4. **Visualization**: The Backend System sends this data to a Visualization Tool or module designed to create a visual representation (e.g., a graph or chart) of the file uploads over time.
5. **Result Display**: Once the visualization is ready, it is sent back through the Backend to the UI, which then displays it to the User.

This sequence diagram outlines a simplified view of the process underlying the visualization of file uploads over a specified time period, which adheres to the project's goals of enhancing user experience and data management.

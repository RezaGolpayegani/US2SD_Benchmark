Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves designing interaction between various system components and actors to fulfill the stated goal of making archival material widely available. Below is an example sequence diagram that reflects the typical interactions envisioned as part of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project. 

This example focuses on the sequence involving an archivist who is making archival materials accessible while ensuring that licensing, rights management, and access controls are properly addressed. Please note, the sequence diagram is simplified for clarity and understanding, omitting some of the complex conditional logic and error handling that would be part of a real-world implementation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist
participant "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as System
participant "Licensing\nManagement Module" as Licensing
participant "Access Control\nModule" as AccessControl
participant "Database" as DB

== Make Archival Material Available ==

Archivist -> System: Access system
activate System

System -> Licensing: Fetch licensing options
activate Licensing
Licensing -> DB: Retrieve licenses
activate DB
DB --> Licensing: Licenses data
deactivate DB
Licensing --> System: License options
deactivate Licensing

System --> Archivist: Show license options
Archivist -> System: Select appropriate license
activate System

System -> Licensing: Apply selected license to material
activate Licensing
Licensing -> DB: Update material license
activate DB
DB --> Licensing: Confirmation
deactivate DB
Licensing --> System: License applied
deactivate Licensing

System -> AccessControl: Set access restrictions
activate AccessControl
AccessControl -> DB: Update access parameters
activate DB
DB --> AccessControl: Confirmation
deactivate DB
AccessControl --> System: Access restrictions set
deactivate AccessControl

System --> Archivist: Confirm material is available
deactivate System

This sequence starts with the Archivist accessing the digital archive management system, following through the process of selecting and applying licensing options to the archival material, setting access restrictions, and finally confirming that the material is available for use. 

The diagram assumes a simplified process flow for clarity:

- **Archivist** accesses the system to manage and share archival materials.
- The **Digital Archive Management System** interacts with both the **Licensing Management Module** for handling licensing options and the **Access Control Module** for setting access restrictions.
- Both modules interact with the **Database** to retrieve information and confirm changes, such as licensing details and access restrictions. 

To customize this diagram to your specific needs or incorporate more complex workflows (such as handling batch uploads, managing user permissions, or integrating with external authentication systems), additional participants and interactions would need to be added accordingly.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format covers the interactions among the system components from the perspective of an admin using the dashboard. The sequence diagram will illustrate steps from logging into the dashboard through viewing usage stats and recycling locations, to identifying neighborhoods with high activity.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin as A
participant "Login Interface" as LI
participant "Admin Dashboard" as AD
participant "Database" as DB

== Authentication ==
A -> LI: Enter credentials
LI -> DB: Validate admin credentials
DB --> LI: Authentication success
LI --> A: Access granted

== View Usage Stats ==
A -> AD: Select "View Usage Stats & Locations"
AD -> DB: Query stats by neighborhood
DB --> AD: Return stats data
AD --> A: Display stats and map locations

== Identify High Activity Areas ==
A -> AD: Request high drop-off areas
AD -> DB: Query for neighborhoods with highest activity
DB --> AD: Return list of high activity neighborhoods
AD --> A: Show neighborhoods and suggest actions

== Engage More Facilities ==
A -> AD: Select "Engage More Facilities"
AD -> A: Display form to contact new facilities
A -> AD: Submit facility engagement request
AD -> DB: Store new facility engagement info
DB --> AD: Confirmation of engagement action
AD --> A: Display engagement success message

This sequence diagram follows the described user story steps, focusing on the admin's interactions with the RecycleSmart platform.

The admin starts by logging into the system through the Login Interface. Upon successful authentication (validated by the Database), the admin gains access to the Admin Dashboard. Here, the admin can select to view usage statistics and locations of recycling drop-offs across different neighborhoods, which are fetched from the Database and displayed on the dashboard.

Next, to identify neighborhoods with the highest number of drop-offs (indicating high activity), the admin sends a request through the dashboard, which again queries the Database for this specific data. The Database returns this information to be displayed on the dashboard, allowing the admin to visualize which areas have the most significant impact or need for additional recycling facilities.

If the admin decides to engage more facilities based on the data observed, they can select an option to do so directly from the dashboard. This action prompts a form where the admin can input details about the engagement request. Upon submission, this information is stored in the Database, and a confirmation of the action is sent back to the admin, concluding the sequence with a success message indicating the engagement's initiation.

This diagram simplifies complex interactions into a sequence that aligns with the admin's goal to analyze and enhance the platform's effectiveness in promoting recycling activities across various neighborhoods.

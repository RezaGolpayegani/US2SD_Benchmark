Given your request, here's a Plant UML code snippet that represents a sequence diagram for the user story: "As a member, I want to read my borrowed books list, so that I can keep track of borrowed books." This sequence diagram outlines the interaction between the system components involved when a library member wishes to view their list of borrowed books.

```plaintext
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Member
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Application Server" as App
database "Database" as DB

== Member views list of borrowed books ==
Member -> Web : Requests borrowed books list
Web -> App : Fetch borrowed books request
App -> DB : Query borrowed books list for Member
DB --> App : Return borrowed'
App --> Web : Display list of borrowed books
Web --> Member : Shows borrowed books list

```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process as follows:

1. **Member Initiates Request:** The library member (user) requests to see their list of borrowed books, usually through a user interface on a library management system's website or app.
2. **Web Interface Forwards Request:** The request is sent from the web interface to the application server. This interaction indicates the beginning of a process in the backend system.
3. **Application Server Queries Database:** The application server receives the request and queries the database to retrieve the list of books borrowed by the specific member.
4. **Database Responds:** The database processes the request, fetching the details of all books currently borrowed by the member.
5. **Application Server Processes Data:** After receiving the data from the database, the application server processes it, potentially formatting or filtering the results as needed for display.
6. **Web Interface Displays Results:** Finally, the application server sends the data back to the web interface, which displays the list of borrowed books to the member.

This sequence is a simplified representation meant to depict the core interactions between a member, the front-end interface, the application logic on the server, and the database. Depending on the actual architecture of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), additional steps, services, or security checks (such as authentication and authorization) might be integrated into this process.

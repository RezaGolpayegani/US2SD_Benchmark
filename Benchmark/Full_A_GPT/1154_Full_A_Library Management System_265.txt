Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story in PlantUML format involves outlining the interactions between the system components and the user when a book search is initiated by title. Here's how the interactions might unfold in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Search Controller" as SC
participant "Database" as DB

M -> W : Enter book title\ninto search
W -> SC : Request search by title
activate SC
SC -> DB : Query books by title
activate DB
DB --> SC : Return book results
deactivate DB
SC --> W : Display book results
W --> M : Show book results
deactivate SC

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the following steps are illustrated:

1. The **Member** (M) initiates the search process by entering the book title into the search field within the **Web Interface** (W).
2. The **Web Interface** sends the search request to the **Search Controller** (SC).
3. The **Search Controller**, responsible for handling search requests, queries the **Database** (DB) for books that match the title.
4. The **Database** returns the search results to the **Search Controller**.
5. The **Search Controller** then sends the results back to the **Web Interface**.
6. Finally, the **Web Interface** displays the search results to the **Member**.

This diagram is a high-level overview focusing on the sequence of interactions without delving into the specific implementation details of each component. Each of these components can be further detailed in their own diagrams or descriptions to elaborate on their internal workings, data handling, and security measures.

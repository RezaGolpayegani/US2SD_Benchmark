Considering the provided project description and the specific user story, below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram visually represents the interaction between different system components when a user wants to view and update the inventory of equipment and consumables present in the center.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant WebInterface
participant AuthenticationModule
participant InventoryService
participant Database

User -> WebInterface: Request inventory page
WebInterface -> AuthenticationModule: Validate user session
AuthenticationModule --> WebInterface: Session valid

WebInterface -> InventoryService: Fetch inventory data
InventoryService -> Database: Query inventory items
Database --> InventoryService: Return inventory items
InventoryService --> WebInterface: Display inventory items
WebInterface --> User: Show inventory page with items

User -> WebInterface: Request edit item (Equipment/Consumable)
WebInterface -> AuthenticationModule: Check edit permissions
AuthenticationModule --> WebInterface: Permissions valid

WebInterface -> InventoryService: Request edit form for item
InventoryService --> WebInterface: Provide edit form
WebInterface --> User: Show edit form

User -> WebInterface: Submit updated item details
WebInterface -> InventoryService: Update item in inventory
InventoryService -> Database: Update item details
Database --> InventoryService: Confirm update
InventoryService --> WebInterface: Confirm update to user
WebInterface --> User: Show update confirmation

Explanation of the Steps:
1. **User requests to view the inventory:** The user accesses the Neurohub web interface and requests to view the inventory of equipment and consumables.
2. **Authentication check:** The web interface queries the authentication module to ensure the user is logged in and has a valid session.
3. **Fetching inventory data:** Upon successful authentication, the web interface requests the current inventory data from the Inventory Service.
4. **Querying the database:** The Inventory Service retrieves the equipment and consumable details from the database.
5. **Displaying the inventory:** The fetched inventory items are sent back to the web interface, which then displays them to the user.
6. **User requests to edit an item:** The user selects an item to edit, and the web interface checks with the Authentication Module to verify if the user has the necessary permissions.
7. **Providing the edit form:** If permissions are confirmed, the Inventory Service provides an edit form for the selected item.
8. **Submitting the updated details:** The user submits the updated item details through the web interface.
9. **Updating the database:** The Inventory Service updates the item details in the database and sends a confirmation back to the web interface.
10. **Confirmation to the user:** The web interface finally shows a confirmation message to the user indicating that the item has been successfully updated.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow for viewing and updating the inventory of equipment and consumables, fitting within the scope of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project.

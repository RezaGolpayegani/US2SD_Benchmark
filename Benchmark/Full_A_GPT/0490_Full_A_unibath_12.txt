To create a PlantUML sequence diagram for your user story, we will illustrate the interaction between the depositor, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform (referenced as ERDMP for brevity), and other University systems such as Pure and Opus, which are used to manage research outputs and publications. This sequence will focus on the process of depositing a dataset with automatic metadata filling and remembering previous inputs.

Please note, the actual implementation complexity and the systems involved might vary. This is a simplified representation based on the provided project description.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor
participant ERDMP
participant "Pure/Opus" as PureOpus
database "Metadata Store" as Metadata

== Deposit Process Initiation ==
Depositor -> ERDMP : Initiate Deposit
note right of ERDMP: Display deposit form

== Fetch Metadata from University Systems ==
ERDMP -> PureOpus : Request Metadata for Depositor
activate PureOpus
PureOpus --> ERDMP : Return Metadata
deactivate PureOpus
note right of ERDMP: Fill deposit form with Metadata

== Check for Previous Deposits ==
ERDMP -> Metadata : Query for previous deposits by Depositor
activate Metadata
Metadata --> ERDMP : Return Metadata of previous deposits
deactivate Metadata
note right of ERDMP: Pre-fill additional information\nfrom previous deposits

== Depositor Reviews Auto-filled Metadata ==
ERDMP -> Depositor : Present auto-filled form
Depositor -> ERDMP : Confirms/updates information
note right of Depositor: User may modify\nauto-filled data

== Finalize Deposit ==
Depositor -> ERDMP : Submit final data
ERDMP -> Metadata : Store final dataset metadata
activate Metadata
Metadata --> ERDMP : Confirm data stored
deactivate Metadata

note right of ERDMP: Generate DOI, apply licenses,\nand link to publication if applicable
ERDMP -> Depositor : Deposit confirmation & DOI

To use this PlantUML script:

1. You need a PlantUML environment, such as an online editor or an IDE with PlantUML integration.
2. Copy and paste the provided script into your PlantUML editing environment.
3. Generate the diagram. The script illustrates a sequence where the depositor initiates a dataset deposit, automatically fills the metadata from other systems like Pure and Opus, and possibly recalls metadata from previous deposits. This sequence ends with the dataset being successfully stored and confirmed to the depositor.

This diagram represents a high-level view and can be customized further as needed, such as adding more specific steps, error handling routines, or interactions with additional systems.

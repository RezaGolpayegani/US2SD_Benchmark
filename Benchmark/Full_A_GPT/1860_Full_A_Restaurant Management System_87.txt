Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a management user, I want to see the number of orders per month" involves illustrating how the different entities within the Restaurant Management and Operations System interact to fulfill this requirement. Given the text-based nature of our communication, I'll describe how the sequence diagram can be structured using PlantUML code, rather than providing an actual visual diagram.

The sequence diagram must include interactions between the management user, the system interface, potentially the reporting module (as a logical component of the system responsible for aggregating and processing data), and the database that stores orders along with their timestamps.

### PlantUML Code

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ManagementUser as Management
actor SystemInterface as Interface
entity ReportingModule as Report
database "RestaurantDB" as DB

Management -> Interface : Request monthly order count
Interface -> Report : Fetch order data for given month
Report -> DB : Query orders by date range
DB --> Report : Return order data
Report -> Report : Process order data to calculate total
Report --> Interface : Send monthly order count
Interface --> Management : Display monthly order total

### Description of the Sequence

1. **Management User Request**: The management user (Management) initiates the request for the number of orders for a specific month through the system interface (Interface). This step represents the user action of selecting a month and requesting data through a dashboard or a reporting feature within the system.

2. **Fetch Order Data**: The system interface forwards the request to the reporting module (Report), which is responsible for handling data queries and generating reports. 

3. **Database Query**: The reporting module constructs and executes a query against the restaurant's database (DB), specifically targeting the orders table or collection. The query filters orders by the selected month's date range.

4. **Return Order Data**: The database returns the filtered order data back to the reporting module. 

5. **Process Order Data**: Within the reporting module, the retrieved data is processed to count the total number of orders made during the specified month.

6. **Send Monthly Order Count**: The reporting module sends the calculated monthly order count back to the system interface.

7. **Display Monthly Order Total**: Finally, the system interface displays the total number of orders for the selected month to the management user.

This sequence diagram accurately represents the interactions between a management user and the system to retrieve and display the total number of orders within a given month, showcasing the flow of data and the processing steps involved in the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that represents the user story: "As a FABS user, I want to have my validations run in a reasonable amount of time". This diagram assumes an interaction across components like the FABS user interface, the back-end validation service, and a database for persisted data. This simplifies the process to focus primarily on validation time efficiency.

```
@startuml
participant "FABS User" as User
participant "FABS Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Validation Service" as Validator
participant "Database" as DB

activate User
User -> WebUI: Submit file for validation
activate WebUI
WebUI -> Validator: Request data validation
activate Validator

Validator -> DB: Fetch relevant validation rules
activate DB
DB --> Validator: Validation rules
deactivate DB

Validator -> Validator: Run validations against submission
note right of Validator: Optimized algorithms\nto ensure efficiency

Validator -> DB: Log validation results
activate DB
DB --> Validator: Acknowledge logging
deactivate DB

Validator --> WebUI: Validation results
deactivate Validator

WebUI --> User: Display validation results
deactivate WebUI

User -> WebUI: Request re-submission (if needed)
WebUI -> Validator: Request data re-validation
Validator -> DB: Log new submission
DB --> Validator: Acknowledge logging
Validator --> WebUI: New Validation results
WebUI --> User: Display new validation results

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified process where a FABS user submits a file for validation through the web interface, which then forwards the request to the back-end validation service. The validation service fetches the necessary rules from the database, performs the validation, logs the results back in the database, and finally, returns the outcome to the web interface for the user to view. If the validations do not pass, there is a pathway for re-submission highlighted, emphasizing the iterative nature of achieving acceptable validation times. 

This model supports scenarios where optimizations in the validation process are crucial to ensuring validations run within a reasonable timeframe, such as implementing optimized algorithms and ensuring effective communication with the database to fetch rules and log results efficiently.

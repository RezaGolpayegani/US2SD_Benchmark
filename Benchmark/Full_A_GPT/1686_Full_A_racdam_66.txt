To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates the user story "As an archivist, I want to have electronic versions of the collection files available for staff use, so that I increase accessibility and I do not lose the original files," we can break down the process involved in making electronic versions of collection files available for staff use. This could involve steps such as scanning physical documents, uploading digital files, applying appropriate metadata, storing the files securely, and ensuring they are accessible by staff based on their roles and permissions.

Below is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines this process. Please note, for a real-world application, the sequence might entail more steps and interactions depending on the specific digital archival system's requirements and capabilities.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant "ScanningSystem" as Scan
participant "DigitalArchiveSystem" as DAS
participant "MetadataApplication" as Metadata
participant "StorageService" as Storage
participant "AccessControl" as AC
participant "StaffUser" as Staff

Archivist -> Scan : Scan physical documents
Scan -> DAS : Upload scanned files
Archivist -> Metadata : Apply metadata to files
Metadata -> DAS : Update files with metadata
Archivist -> Storage : Store files securely
loop Each Staff User
    Archivist -> AC : Set file access permissions
    AC -> Staff : Grant access based on role
end
Staff -> DAS : Access electronic files for use

This sequence diagram starts with the Archivist scanning physical documents to create digital versions. These scanned files are then uploaded to the Digital Archive System (DAS). The Archivist applies metadata to these files using a Metadata Application, which updates the files in the DAS with this metadata. The Archivist then stores the files securely using a Storage Service. For each staff user who needs access, the Archivist sets file access permissions in the Access Control system, which grants access to the staff based on their roles. Finally, staff can access these electronic files for use as needed.

To render this PlantUML code:

1. You would need to use a PlantUML processor, which can be found online or through various development tools that support PlantUML.
   
2. Paste the code into the processor to generate the sequence diagram.

3. Adjust and expand the diagram as necessary to fit the unique requirements and system specifics of your digital archive management enhancement project. 

Remember, sequence diagrams can become complex quickly, so focus on the key interactions that are most relevant to the scenario you're diagramming.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for your specific user story in PlantUML syntax involves representing the various entities involved (such as the Inspection Supervisor, the Portal, and relevant backend systems) and the sequence of interactions that occur when an Inspection Supervisor manages inspector workloads. Below is an example sequence diagram that outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Inspection Supervisor" as supervisor
participant "Portal Interface" as portal
database "Workload Management System" as workloadSystem
entity "Inspector Profiles" as inspectors
entity "Service Level Agreements (SLA) Database" as sladb
entity "Inspection Scheduling System" as scheduling

== Manage Inspector Workload ==

supervisor -> portal : Access Workload Management
activate portal

portal -> workloadSystem : Fetch Current Workloads
activate workloadSystem
workloadSystem -> inspectors : Retrieve Inspector Data
activate inspectors
inspectors --> workloadSystem : Inspector Data
deactivate inspectors

workloadSystem --> portal : Display Current Workloads
deactivate workloadSystem
portal --> supervisor : Show Workloads and Inspectors
deactivate portal

supervisor -> portal : Select Inspector to Manage
activate portal

portal -> workloadSystem : Request Inspector Details
activate workloadSystem
workloadSystem -> inspectors : Query Selected Inspector
activate inspectors
inspectors --> workloadSystem : Inspector Details
deactivate inspectors

workloadSystem --> portal : Show Inspector Details
deactivate workloadSystem
portal --> supervisor : Display Details
deactivate portal

supervisor -> portal : Assign/Reassign Inspections
activate portal

portal -> scheduling : Update Inspection Assignments
activate scheduling
scheduling -> inspectors : Notify Inspector(s)
activate inspectors
inspectors --> scheduling : Acknowledge Notification
deactivate inspectors

scheduling -> sladb : Update SLA Compliance Status
activate sladb
sladb --> scheduling : SLA Status Updated
deactivate sladb

scheduling --> portal : Confirm Updated Assignments
deactivate scheduling
portal --> supervisor : Display Confirmation
deactivate portal

### Explanation:
- **Inspection Supervisor**: Initiates the process of managing inspector workloads by interacting with the Portal Interface.
- **Portal Interface**: The front-end interface through which the supervisor accesses the Workload Management System.
- **Workload Management System**: Back-end system responsible for handling inspector workloads, assignments, and details.
- **Inspector Profiles**: Database storing information about each inspector, including their skills, current workload, and availability.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLA) Database**: Contains information about service level requirements to ensure inspections meet predetermined quality and timeliness standards.
- **Inspection Scheduling System**: Manages the scheduling and assignment of inspections to inspectors, ensuring efficient workload distribution and SLA compliance.

### Note:
This sequence diagram serves as a conceptual outline based on the user story provided. Depending on the specific implementation details and requirements of the County Services & Property Information Portal, additional steps or systems may be involved (e.g., authentication processes, more detailed interactions for inspection assignment reevaluation, etc.).

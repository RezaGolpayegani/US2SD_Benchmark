To generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a library member, I want to get notifications about due dates so that I can remember the due date," let's depict the interactions between the system components involved in sending a due date notification to a library member.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant System as S
participant Database as DB
participant NotificationService as NS

M -> S : Log in
activate S
S -> DB : Fetch member details
activate DB
DB --> S : Member details
deactivate DB

S -> DB : Get loaned items and due dates
activate DB
DB --> S : Loaned items with due dates
deactivate DB
S --> M : Show loaned items & due dates
deactivate S

loop Daily check for due dates
    S -> DB : Check for due items
    activate DB
    DB --> S : List of due items and members
    deactivate DB
    S -> NS : Prepare notifications for due items
    activate NS
    NS -> M : Send due date notification
    deactivate NS
end
@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Member (M)** logs into the system first. This sequence diagram starts from the point where a library member engages with the system to review or borrow items.
   
2. **System (S)** then fetches the member details from the **Database (DB)**, a crucial step to ensure that notifications are sent to the right user.

3. **S** also retrieves a list of items the member has loaned out along with their due dates, enabling it to display this information to the member.

4. Separately, the system has a loop that represents a daily scheduled task where **S** checks the **DB** for any loaned items that are due soon.

5. For any found items, **S** then requests the **NotificationService (NS)** to prepare and send out due date notifications. 

6. **NS** being the service responsible for managing how notifications are sent, whether it be through email, SMS, or push notifications, then sends a due date notification to the **Member (M)**.

This sequence focuses on the interactions necessary for managing and sending notifications about due dates for loaned library items to members.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story: "As a researcher, I want to access tagged working through the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project", involves capturing the interaction between the researcher, the system's user interface (UI), server, database, and potentially other systems involved in delivering the tagged working papers. Below is a PlantUML script that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as researcher
participant "UI: Web Interface" as UI
participant "Server: Application Logic" as server
participant "Database" as db

researcher -> UI : Enter search criteria with specific tags
UI -> server : Request working papers with tags
server -> db : Query for tagged working papers
db --> server : Return search results
server --> UI : Display working papers
UI --> researcher : Show list of working papers with tags

alt Download Request
    researcher -> UI : Request to download selected working paper
    UI -> server : Verify access rights and request download
    server -> db : Check for restrictions
    db --> server : Restrictions status
    alt No Restrictions
        server -> db : Log download action
        db --> server : Log confirmed
        server -> UI : Initiate download
        UI --> researcher : Provide download link
    else Restrictions Found
        server --> UI : Display restriction message
        UI --> researcher : Show restriction message
    end
end

This PlantUML diagram describes the following process for a researcher wanting to access tagged working papers:

1. **Researcher Interaction**: The researcher interacts with the web interface to input search criteria including specific tags related to the working papers they are interested in.
2. **System Processing Request**: The server receives the request to find tagged working papers, queries the database, and retrieved papers are sent back to the web interface.
3. **Display Results**: The server sends the results to the UI, which then displays the list of working papers to the researcher.
4. **Downloading Process**: If the researcher decides to download a paper, the process checks for any access restrictions on the paper. If no restrictions are found, the download is logged, and the researcher is provided with a download link. If there are restrictions, a message is displayed to the researcher.

This script represents a basic interaction flow and can be expanded based on additional rules or functionalities related to the system's user access levels, specific database interaction details, or more complex operations related to downloading and accessing digital archival materials.

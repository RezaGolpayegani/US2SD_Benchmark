Given your request, here's a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that represents the user story: "As a staff, I want to delete book checkouts if the book is returned." This diagram assumes a scenario where the staff member interacts with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to remove a checkout record after verifying a book's return.

Please note, to convert this script into a visual sequence diagram, you'd need to use a PlantUML environment (like an online editor or a tool that supports PlantUML).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "System Backend" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

== Delete Book Checkout ==

Staff -> Web : Selects returned book
activate Web

Web -> Backend : Request to delete checkout (bookId, staffId)
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Verify book return status (bookId)
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return status: Returned
deactivate DB

Backend -> DB : Delete checkout record (bookId)
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Record deleted
deactivate DB

Backend --> Web : Checkout deletion success
deactivate Backend

Web --> Staff : Display success message
deactivate Web

```

This sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:
1. The staff member selects the returned book through the web interface to initiate the process of deleting a checkout record.
2. The web interface sends a request to the system backend with the required details (e.g., book ID and staff ID).
3. The system backend then verifies if the book's return status is marked as "Returned" by querying the database.
4. Upon confirming the book has indeed been returned, the backend sends another request to the database to delete the checkout record associated with the specified book ID.
5. The database confirms the deletion of the checkout record.
6. Finally, the system backend sends a confirmation of the checkout record deletion to the web interface, which then displays a success message to the staff member.

This scenario focuses on the specific user story of deleting book checkout records upon return and assumes that the book return status is accurately updated in the system when books are returned.

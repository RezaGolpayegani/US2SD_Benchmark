Creating a sequence diagram for the specific user story, "As a member, I want to look up books by publication above date," involves illustrating the interactions between the user (library member) and the components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This interaction primarily involves the Member Interface, Search System, and Database components. The flow can be depicted in PlantUML as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant MemberInterface as "Member Interface"
participant SearchSystem as "Search System"
database CLMSDB as "CLMS Database"

MemberInterface -> SearchSystem : enterSearchCriteria(publicationDate)
activate SearchSystem

SearchSystem -> CLMSDB : queryBooksByPublicationDate(publicationDate)
activate CLMSDB

CLMSDB --> SearchSystem : returnBookResults
deactivate CLMSDB

SearchSystem --> MemberInterface : displayResults(books)
deactivate SearchSystem
@enduml
```

Let's break down the steps illustrated in this sequence diagram:

1. **Member Interface to Search System:** The user (library member) interacts with the Member Interface by specifying the search criteria based on the publication date. This action triggers the Member Interface to send a message/request to the Search System to look up books by that publication date.

2. **Search System to CLMS Database:** The Search System processes this request and formulates a query to retrieve books that match the specified publication date from the CLMS Database.

3. **CLMS Database to Search System:** The CLMS Database executes the query, fetches the matching book records, and returns these results to the Search System.

4. **Search System to Member Interface:** Finally, the Search System receives the book results and sends them to the Member Interface, which displays the listing of book results to the user based on the specified publication date.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of how the main components of the Comprehensive Library Management System interact for this specific user story, focusing on the backend logic and data flow that enables members to search for books by publication date.

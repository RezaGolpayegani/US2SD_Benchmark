Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves representing the interactions between various objects or actors in delivering streaming media from the repository. This sequence diagram focuses on the main steps taken by a library staff member to deliver streaming media. Since the description does not specify the precise systems or interfaces involved, assumptions will be made based on common practices in digital repository management systems.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff" as staff
participant "Repository Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
database "Digital Repository" as Repo
participant "Media Server" as Media
participant "Content Delivery Network (CDN)" as CDN

staff -> UI: Selects media for streaming
alt Authentication Required
    UI -> Auth: Request access validation
    Auth --> UI: Confirm access
end

UI -> Repo: Retrieve media metadata
Repo --> UI: Media metadata
UI -> Media: Request media streaming setup
Media --> UI: Streaming configuration parameters
UI -> Repo: Log access and setup details
Repo --> UI: Log confirmation

UI -> CDN: Initiate streaming session
CDN -> Media: Request media content
Media --> CDN: Transfer media content
CDN -> UI: Provide streaming link
UI --> staff: Display streaming link

```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process based on the following assumptions and simplifications:

1. **Selection**: The library staff selects the desired media content for streaming through a repository interface.
2. **Authentication**: If required, the system checks for valid access through an authentication service.
3. **Metadata Retrieval**: The repository interface retrieves and displays the media's metadata from the digital repository.
4. **Streaming Setup**: The media server is requested to set up the streaming, returning the necessary configuration parameters.
5. **Logging**: The access and setup details are logged in the repository for record-keeping and audit purposes.
6. **Initiating Streaming**: The repository interface communicates with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to initiate the streaming session.
7. **Content Transfer and Delivery**: The CDN requests the media content from the media server, which transfers the requested content. The CDN then provides a streaming link to the repository interface, which is displayed to the library staff.

This diagram has simplified the flow to focus on the main steps and interactions relevant to the user story. The actual implementation may involve additional layers of interaction, especially related to security, error handling, and user notifications.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story requires understanding the interaction between different system components and the user. Below is a Plant UML code that represents the sequence diagram for the user story: "As an Older Person, I want to receive a wake-up call from ALFRED in the morning checking on me if I am ok."

The sequence involves ALFRED, the Older Person, and potentially a Caregiver or Emergency Services if the Older Person does not respond positively.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Older Person" as op
participant "ALFED Device" as ad
participant "Server" as s
participant "Caregiver/Emergency Services" as ces

alt Morning Time Reached
    ad -> s: "Trigger wake-up call event"
    s -> ad: "Send wake-up call command"
    ad -> op: "Initiate wake-up call\nCheck if Older Person is ok"
    op -> ad: "Response: I am ok"
    ad -> s: "Log response\nStatus: Ok"
else No Response or Help Needed
    ad -> op: "Second attempt wake-up call"
    alt No Response after Second Attempt
        ad -> s: "Log event: No Response"
        s -> ad: "Initiate emergency protocol"
        ad -> ces: "Notify Caregiver/Emergency Services"
        ces -> op: "Provide required assistance"
    else Positive Response On Second Attempt
        op -> ad: "Response: I am ok"
        ad -> s: "Log response\nStatus: Ok after 2nd attempt"
    end
end

This diagram illustrates the interactions starting from the ALFRED device, triggering a wake-up call event based on a predefined schedule (morning time). The sequence includes the possibility of the Older Person not responding to the first call, thereby making a second attempt. If there is still no response or if help is directly requested, the ALFRED device will initiate protocols to inform Caregivers or Emergency Services as necessary. 

In more comprehensive implementations, you might want to detail the communication protocols, include error handling, or expand on how ALFRED interacts with other services for emergency scenarios. The diagram keeps a focus on the core sequence to maintain clarity.

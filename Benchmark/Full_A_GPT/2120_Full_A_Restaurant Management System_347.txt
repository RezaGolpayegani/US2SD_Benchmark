To craft a sequence diagram for the given user story: "As an employee, I want to read the customer orders list, so that I can make preparations," we'll outline the flow of events involved in this process using PlantUML syntax. This will involve interactions between the employee, the system's front end, the server, and the database where customer orders are stored and retrieved from.

Here's a simple representation in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Server: Order Management Module" as Server
database "Database" as DB

== Reading Customer Orders List ==

Employee -> Frontend : Selects "View Orders"
Frontend -> Server : GET /orders
Server -> DB : Fetch Orders
DB --> Server : Return Orders List
Server --> Frontend : Display Orders List
Frontend --> Employee : Shows Orders List

### Explanation:
- **Employee**: The actor (employee), who initiates the process by wanting to view the customer orders list.
- **Frontend Interface**: This represents the graphical user interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, where the employee interacts.
- **Server: Order Management Module**: This part of the server handles requests related to order management, such as retrieving the orders list.
- **Database (DB)**: Where orders data is stored. The database returns the requested orders list back to the server upon request.

### Sequence of Events:
1. The **Employee** selects the option to "View Orders" on the frontend interface.
2. The **Frontend Interface** sends a request to the backend server, specifically to the Order Management Module, to fetch the orders list. This is typically done through an API endpoint like `GET /orders`.
3. The **Server**, upon receiving the request, queries the **Database** to fetch the list of customer orders.
4. The **Database** returns the orders list to the **Server**.
5. The **Server** then sends this data back to the **Frontend Interface**.
6. Finally, the **Frontend Interface** displays the orders list to the **Employee**.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved when an employee wants to read the customer orders list to make preparations. Depending on the complexity of the system and specific requirements, additional details and steps could be added. For example, steps for authenticating the employee or filtering the orders based on certain criteria could also be included.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As an admin, I want to automatically validate the ingested contents for copyright infringement" using PlantUML would involve defining the interactions between different system components involved in this process. Let's outline these components and their interactions.

**Components**:
- **Admin**: Initiates the content validation process.
- **Content Ingestion System**: Receives the content to be validated.
- **Content Validation Service**: Validates the content against a database of copyrighted materials.
- **Copyright Database**: Contains records of copyrighted materials.
- **Validation Result Handler**: Processes the outcome of the validation.
- **Notification Service**: Notifies the admin about the result of the content validation.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin
participant "Content Ingestion System" as CIS
participant "Content Validation Service" as CVS
database "Copyright Database" as CDB
participant "Validation Result Handler" as VRH
participant "Notification Service" as NS

Admin -> CIS : Upload content
CIS -> CVS : Request validation
CVS -> CDB : Check copyright
CDB --> CVS : Validation results
CVS --> VRH : Send results
alt Validation passed
    VRH -> NS : Inform Admin (Success)
    NS -> Admin : Content validated successfully
else Validation failed
    VRH -> NS : Inform Admin (Failure)
    NS -> Admin : Copyright infringement detected
end

This sequence diagram starts with the admin uploading content to the Content Ingestion System. The system then requests the Content Validation Service to validate the content, which in turn checks against the Copyright Database. Based on the results, the Content Validation Service reports back to the Validation Result Handler, which either informs the admin of success through the Notification Service if the content passed the validation or warns about a copyright infringement detection.

This high-level sequence diagram can be further detailed by incorporating specific technologies or methods for each step, such as the algorithms or APIs used for content validation and copyright checking.

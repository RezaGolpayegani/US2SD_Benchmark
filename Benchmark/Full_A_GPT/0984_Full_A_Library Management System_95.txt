Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see the locations of the books so that I can put them in the right places" involves detailing the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) when a librarian is trying to find book locations. This involves interactions mainly between the librarian, the system interface, and the database.

Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, depicting these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "Library Interface" as Interface
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

activate Librarian
Librarian -> Interface : search for book details
activate Interface
Interface -> Backend : request book details
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : query book locations
activate DB
DB --> Backend : return book locations
deactivate DB

Backend --> Interface : show book locations with details
deactivate Backend

Interface --> Librarian : display book locations
deactivate Interface

Librarian -> Librarian : uses information to place books

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows these steps:

1. **Initiation**: The librarian initiates the process by searching for book details through the Library Interface.
2. **Request Handling**: The interface receives the request and forwards it to the Backend System.
3. **Query Execution**: The Backend System queries the Database to find the requested book locations.
4. **Data Retrieval**: The Database returns the locations of the book(s) to the Backend System.
5. **Response Forwarding**: The Backend System then sends this information back to the Library Interface.
6. **Display Information**: The Library Interface displays the book locations to the Librarian.
7. **Action by Librarian**: With the locations known, the librarian uses this information to correctly place the books on the shelves.

This sequence of interactions ensures the librarian can efficiently locate books within the library, maintaining order and accessibility for library users.

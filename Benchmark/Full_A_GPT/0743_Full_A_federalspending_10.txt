Given your request to generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story about moving to round 2 of the Help page edits for UI designers seeking approvals from leadership, here's a structured sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "UI Designer" as Designer
participant "Design Software" as Software
participant "Review Team" as Review
participant "Approval System" as Approval
participant "Leadership" as Leadership

Designer -> Software: Make round 2 edits on Help page
note right of Software: Edits may include\nlayout changes, updated FAQs,\nand new user guidance content.
Software -> Designer: Confirm edits completion

Designer -> Review: Submit edits for review
Review -> Review: Review round 2 edits
alt Edits Approved by Review Team
    Review -> Approval: Forward approved edits
else Edits Not Approved
    Review -> Designer: Request additional changes
    Designer -> Software: Implement changes
    loop Until Approved
        Designer -> Review: Resubmit for review
    end
end

Approval -> Leadership: Submit edits for final approval
Leadership -> Leadership: Review submitted edits

### Explanation
- **UI Designer** begins the process by making the second round of edits on the Help page using their Design Software.
- Once the edits are completed, the UI Designer submits these edits for review to the Review Team.
- The Review Team reviews the edits. If the edits meet the Review Team's requirements, they forward the approved edits to the Approval System for final approval. If not, they request additional changes, and the designer must revise and resubmit the edits.
- Approved edits are then submitted to Leadership for final approval. Leadership reviews the submitted edits, and if approved, the UI Designer is notified and may proceed to implement the edits on the live Help page. If Leadership has additional feedback or rejects the edits, the feedback is provided to the designer, who then makes the requested changes. This process repeats until final approval is obtained.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction between different roles in the revision and approval process for UI design changes, specifically focusing on moving to the second round of Help page edits.

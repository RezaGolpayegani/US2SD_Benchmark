Given the user story and project description, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram illustrating the process an authenticated user follows to edit a session on the BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AuthenticatedUser as User
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "User Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Session Management" as SessionMgmt
participant "Database" as DB

User -> Auth: Access platform
activate Auth
Auth --> User: Authentication successful
deactivate Auth

User -> Dashboard: Navigate to My Schedule
activate Dashboard
Dashboard --> User: Display registered sessions
deactivate Dashboard

User -> SessionMgmt: Select Edit on session
activate SessionMgmt
SessionMgmt --> User: Display session details form
deactivate SessionMgmt

User -> SessionMgmt: Submit updated session details
activate SessionMgmt
SessionMgmt -> DB: Validate & update session details
activate DB
DB --> SessionMgmt: Update confirmation
deactivate DB
SessionMgmt --> User: Display success message
deactivate SessionMgmt

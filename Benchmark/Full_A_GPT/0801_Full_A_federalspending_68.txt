Given the project description and the specific requirement for a sequence diagram to illustrate the user story for FABS users encountering accurate representation of errors during submissions, the following is a PlantUML sequence diagram. This diagram outlines the interaction sequences between the FABS user, the Broker Platform, and other components involved in the process of submission and error feedback.

Please note that due to the constraints of this medium, you'll need to use the PlantUML tool or compatible software to visualize the diagram described in the code below.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FABSUser as User
participant "Broker UI" as UI
participant "Submission Process" as Submission
participant "Validation Engine" as Validation
participant "Error Handling Module" as ErrorModule
participant "Database" as DB

User -> UI : Submit file
UI -> Submission : Initiate submission process
activate Submission
Submission -> Validation : Validate file content
activate Validation
Validation -> DB : Retrieve validation rules
DB --> Validation : Validation rules
alt Validation Success
    Validation --> Submission : Success response
    Submission --> UI : Display success message
    UI --> User : Show success notification
else Validation Fails
    Validation --> ErrorModule : Generate error details
    ErrorModule -> Validation : Error message with specifics
    Validation --> Submission : Error response with specifics
    Submission --> UI : Display error message
    UI --> User : Show error notification with specifics
end
deactivate Validation
deactivate Submission

### Understanding the Diagram:

1. **FABS User (User):** Represents the action of a Federal Agency Broker Submission (FABS) user initiating a file submission.
2. **Broker UI (UI):** The interface through which the FABS user submits the file.
3. **Submission Process (Submission):** Internal Broker platform logic that handles the initiation and management of submissions.
4. **Validation Engine (Validation):** Dedicated component responsible for validating the submitted file against a set of pre-defined rules, ensuring data integrity and compliance.
5. **Error Handling Module (ErrorModule):** A special component responsible for generating understandable and actionable error messages based on the validation results.
6. **Database (DB):** The data repository where validation rules, historical data, and submission information are stored.

The sequence begins with the FABS user submitting a file through the Broker UI. The submission process is then initiated, which in turn passes the file to the validation engine. The validation engine checks the file against the rules stored in the Database. If the validation passes, a success message is displayed to the user. If the validation fails, the error handling module creates a specific and understandable error message, which is passed back through the submission process to the UI, and finally displayed to the FABS user.

This diagram is a simplified representation focusing on error handling from submission to feedback for the user. It's designed to show how accurate error messages are generated and returned to the user in case of submission failure.

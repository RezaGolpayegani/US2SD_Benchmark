Given the detailed project description of RecycleSmart, the user story provided focuses on an employee wanting to access the route planning system to be guided through the neighborhood. This scenario primarily involves interaction between the employee user, the web application, and possibly third-party mapping services for generating the route.

However, it's essential to note that PlantUML code cannot be directly executed or visualized in this text response. Still, I will provide the PlantUML sequence diagram source code, which you can run in a PlantUML environment or online editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

Here is the PlantUML code to generate the sequence diagram for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as emp
participant "RecycleSmart Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Route Planning System" as RoutePlan
participant "Mapping Service" as MapService

== Authentication Process ==
emp -> UI: Access RecycleSmart
UI -> Auth: Request Authentication
Auth -> UI: Authentication Successful

== Access Route Planning ==
emp -> UI: Select "Route Planning"
UI -> RoutePlan: Fetch Route Planning Tool
note over Routeplan: Determine User Location
RoutePlan -> MapService: Request Neighbourhood Routes
MapService -> RoutePlan: Provide Route Details
RoutePlan -> UI: Display Route Options
UI -> emp: Show Route Planning on Map

== Employee Selects a Route ==
emp -> UI: Select Desired Route
UI -> RoutePlan: Log Route Selection
RoutePlan -> emp: Confirm Route & Provide Navigation

This sequence diagram outlines the process an employee would follow to access the route planning system during work from the RecycleSmart platform. The steps include:

1. The employee accesses the RecycleSmart interface and is authenticated.
2. The employee selects the route planning feature.
3. The RecycleSmart interface interacts with the route planning system, which then communicates with an external mapping service to get the route options.
4. The route planning system provides the employee with route options displayed on the map through the RecycleSmart interface.
5. The employee selects the desired route, and the system confirms the route and provides navigation details.

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story using PlantUML, follow the structure below. This diagram represents the interaction between a Prospective Applicant and the County Services & Property Information Portal system, focusing specifically on the process of researching requirements and selecting a service through the online portal.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ProspectiveApplicant as PA
participant "Online Portal" as OP
participant "Service Database" as SD
participant "Requirements Database" as RD

PA -> OP : Access Portal
activate OP

OP -> OP : Display Services & Information Options
PA -> OP : Select "Research Services"
activate OP

OP -> SD : Fetch Services List
activate SD
SD --> OP : Return Services List
deactivate SD

OP --> PA : Display Available Services
PA -> OP : Choose Specific Service
activate OP

OP -> RD : Query Service Requirements
activate RD
RD --> OP : Return Requirements
deactivate RD

OP --> PA : Show Requirements & Application Information
PA -> OP : Confirm Selection
activate OP

OP -> PA : Provide Next Steps for Application Process
deactivate OP

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Prospective Applicant accessing the online portal and selecting to research services. The portal retrieves a list of services from the Service Database, which is then displayed to the applicant. Upon choosing a specific service, the portal queries the Requirements Database for that service's specific requirements and application information, which are presented to the user. Finally, the applicant confirms their selection, and the portal provides them with the next steps for initiating the application process.

Remember, to use this diagram, you'll need access to a PlantUML environment or editor that can parse and render PlantUML code. This could be a local setup or an online tool that supports PlantUML syntax.

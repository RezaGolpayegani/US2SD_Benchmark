Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story involves demonstrating the interactions between the user (researcher) and the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool), along with any ancillary components necessary to fulfill the request. Given your specific user story, let's construct a sequence diagram focusing on the actions initiated by the researcher with the goal of viewing roles submitted by other researchers in their department to explore potential data manager post sharing.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "DMPTool Backend" as Backend
participant Database

Researcher -> Interface: Access DMPTool
Interface -> Backend: Authenticate User
activate Backend
Backend -> Database: Query User Department and Role Information
activate Database
Database --> Backend: Return Role Information for Department
deactivate Database
Backend -> Database: Query Submitted Roles by Department Researchers
activate Database
Database --> Backend: Return Submitted Roles Data
deactivate Database
Backend --> Interface: Display Roles and Data Manager Posts in Department
deactivate Backend
Interface --> Researcher: Show Sections on Roles by Department Researchers

This sequence diagram outlines the essential interactions for the user story:

1. The **Researcher** accesses the DMPTool via its interface.
2. The **DMPTool Interface** requests user authentication from the **DMPTool Backend**.
3. Once authenticated, the **Backend** queries the **Database** to fetch the department and role information of the logged-in user.
4. The **Database** returns this information to the **Backend**.
5. The **Backend** then queries the **Database** again, this time for submitted roles and data manager posts by other researchers within the same department.
6. The **Database** provides this data back to the **Backend**.
7. The **Backend** sends this information to the **Interface**.
8. Finally, the **Interface** presents the sections on roles and data manager posts submitted by department researchers to the **Researcher**.

This scenario assumes the DMPTool supports features like role-based authentication, departmental segmentation, and role display, with data stored in a robust database that allows such granular queries. It's a simplified visualization focusing on the interaction flow and might need adjustments based on system architecture specifics, such as through the inclusion of APIs, detailed error handling, and user feedback mechanisms.

To translate the user story into a detailed sequence diagram using PlantUML, we need to break down the actions involved in setting start dates, old article dates, and stop publishing dates for articles.

Let's assume the workflow for a site editor to manage article publication dates involves several steps:

1. Logging into the editor panel.
2. Navigating to the content management section.
3. Selecting an article to edit.
4. Setting or updating the 'start publishing date', 'old article date', and 'stop publishing date'.
5. Saving the article settings.
6. System automatically managing article visibility based on the set dates.

The following represents how this sequence might be captured using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteEditor as editor
participant "EditorPanel" as panel
database "ContentManagementSystem" as cms
participant "Article" as article

editor -> panel : Login
editor -> panel : Navigate to Content Management
panel -> cms : Request Article List
cms --> panel : Display Articles
editor -> panel : Select Article to Edit
panel -> article : Load Article Details
editor -> article : Set Start Publishing Date
editor -> article : Set Old Article Date
editor -> article : Set Stop Publishing Date
editor -> article : Save Settings
article -> cms : Update Article Dates in DB
cms --> editor : Confirm Update

autonumber off
article -> cms : Each Day Check Dates
cms -> article : Hide/Show Based on Dates

**Explanation:**
- **SiteEditor (editor):** Represents the site editor performing actions.
- **EditorPanel (panel):** The interface through which the editor interacts with the article settings.
- **ContentManagementSystem (cms):** The backend system where articles and their metadata are stored and managed.
- **Article (article):** Represents an article entity that the editor is modifying.

This sequence diagram outlines the process from logging into the editor panel to the system automatically managing article visibility based on the configured dates. The final part, where the article's visibility is automatically managed by the system each day based on the dates set by the editor, demonstrates how articles will only appear during the appropriate periods, fulfilling the user story's requirements.

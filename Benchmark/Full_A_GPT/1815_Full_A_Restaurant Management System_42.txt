To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a cook, I want to display stock information, so that I can decide on restocking," using PlantUML, we need to diagram the interactions between the cook, the Restaurant Management and Operations System (particularly its inventory module), and potentially the supplier management subsystem if restocking actions are automated within the system. Below is an example of how this sequence might be represented in PlantUML code.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you would need to use a PlantUML interpreter or an online service that can process PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook
participant "Inventory System" as Inventory
participant "Supplier Management" as Supplier

Cook -> Inventory : Check stock levels
activate Inventory

Inventory -> Inventory : Retrieve stock information
Inventory --> Cook : Display stock levels

Cook -> Inventory : Determine low stock items
activate Cook
Cook --> Cook : Decide on restocking\nbased on stock levels and\nupcoming menu requirements
deactivate Cook

Cook -> Inventory : Initiate restock request for\nlow stock items
activate Inventory
Inventory -> Supplier : Order new stock
activate Supplier
Supplier --> Inventory : Confirm order and\ndelivery schedule
deactivate Supplier

Inventory --> Cook : Display restocking\nconfirmation and\ndelivery schedule
deactivate Inventory

```

This sequence diagram starts with the cook checking stock levels, which involves querying the inventory system. The inventory system then retrieves and displays the relevant stock information back to the cook. Based on this information, the cook decides on the necessary restocking for low-stock items. The cook initiates a restock request via the inventory system, which in turn places an order with the supplier management system. Finally, the inventory system confirms the restocking request and informs the cook of the confirmation along with the delivery schedule.

Keep in mind, this diagram can be expanded or modified based on more detailed requirements or specific system behaviors not outlined in the initial project description. For instance, interactions with a notification system could be added to alert cooks automatically when stock levels for high-usage ingredients fall below a certain threshold.

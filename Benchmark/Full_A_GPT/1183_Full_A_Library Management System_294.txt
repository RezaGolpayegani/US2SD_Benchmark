To fulfill the requested task of creating a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story: "As a member, I want to see my previous subscriptions so that I can check that I borrowed the same book before," the following is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines the process of a library member viewing their previous subscriptions in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Member
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Server" as Server
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Subscription Database" as SubDB

Member -> UI: Request to view previous subscriptions
UI -> Server: Validates request
Server -> Auth: Validates member session
Auth --> Server: Session valid
Server -> SubDB: Fetches previous subscription data
SubDB --> Server: Returns previous subscription data
Server --> UI: Displays previous subscriptions
UI --> Member: Shows list of previous subscriptions

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **Member initiates the request:** The member requests to view their previous book subscriptions via the user interface (UI), which could be a webpage or an app.
2. **UI forwards the request to the Server:** The UI receives the member's request and forwards it to the server for processing.
3. **Server requests session validation:** The server requests the authentication service to validate the member's session to ensure security and that the request is made by an authenticated user.
4. **Authentication Service validates the session:** The authentication service checks the session token provided by the member's UI and validates it.
5. **Server requests previous subscription data:** Once the session is validated, the server requests the subscription database for the member's previous subscription data.
6. **Subscription Database returns data:** The subscription database queries for the requested data and returns the member's previous subscription records to the server.
7. **Server sends data to UI:** The server processes the fetched data and forwards it to the UI.
8. **Member views their subscriptions:** Finally, the UI displays the list of previous subscriptions to the member, allowing them to check if they have borrowed the same book before.

This sequence diagram outlines a simplified flow focusing on the essential components and interactions required to achieve the user story's objective within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

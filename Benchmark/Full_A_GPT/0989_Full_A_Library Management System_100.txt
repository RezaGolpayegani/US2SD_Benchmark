To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story where a librarian wants to sort books by their unique identification numbers and related genres to facilitate easier searching, we can use PlantUML to define the interactions among various components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMSG). The scenario assumes the librarian interacts with the UI, which then communicates with the backend systems to perform the sorting and display the results.

Please note that this diagram assumes a basic understanding of how components like the user interface (UI), the controller, the database, and potentially other services interact within a typical web application.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "UI" as ui
participant "Controller" as controller
participant "Sorting Service" as sortingService
participant "Database" as database

librarian -> ui : Requests sorting of books by ID and genre
ui -> controller : SortBooksByIdAndGenre()
controller -> sortingService : PrepareSortQuery("ID", "Genre")
sortingService -> database : ExecuteSortQuery()
database --> sortingService : SortedBooks
sortingService --> controller : Return sorted list
controller --> ui : Display sorted books
ui --> librarian : Shows sorted books list
@enduml
```

This diagram describes the flow from the librarian's request down through the system to the database and back, illustrating how the sorting operation might be processed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Librarian**: Initiates the sorting request through the system's UI.
2. **UI (User Interface)**: Receives the librarian's input and forwards the request to the controller to sort books by their unique ID and genre.
3. **Controller**: Interprets the request, and calls the sorting service to prepare the appropriate query with sorting parameters (in this case, "ID" and "Genre").
4. **Sorting Service**: Constructs the SQL query (or a query relevant to the database in use) required to sort the books by their unique IDs and genres.
5. **Database**: Executes the sorting query and returns the sorted list of books.
6. **Sorting Service**: Receives the sorted list from the database.
7. **Controller**: Gets the sorted list from the sorting service.
8. **UI**: Presents the sorted list to the librarian.

This sequence ensures that the librarian can efficiently sort and search for books in the library's collection based on unique identification numbers and genres, streamlining their workflow and improving overall efficiency.

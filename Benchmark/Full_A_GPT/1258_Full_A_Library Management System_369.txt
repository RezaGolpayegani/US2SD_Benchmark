Certainly! Here's a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a student, I want to see shelf information of a book." This scenario involves several steps, including the student searching for the book, selecting it from the search results, and then viewing its shelf information.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Student
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Library System" as System
database "Book Database" as Database
participant "Book Info Page" as InfoPage

Student -> Search : enter(search terms)
Search -> System : searchRequest(search terms)
System -> Database : queryBooks(search terms)
Database --> System : returnBooks(resultsList)
System --> Search : displayResults(resultsList)
Student -> Search : selectBook(bookID)
Search -> System : requestBookInfo(bookID)
System -> Database : queryBookInfo(bookID)
Database --> System : bookInfo{title, author, shelf}
System --> InfoPage : displayBookInfo(bookInfo)
InfoPage --> Student : show(title, author, shelf)

#### Explanation:

1. **Student Enters Search Terms**: The student starts by entering search terms (like title, author) into the "Search Interface".
2. **Search Request**: The search interface then sends a search request to the Library System.
3. **Query Books**: The Library System queries the "Book Database" for books matching the search terms.
4. **Return Books to System**: The Book Database returns a list of books that match the search criteria to the Library System.
5. **Display Results**: The Library System sends the results list back to the Search Interface, which displays them to the student.
6. **Select Book**: The student selects a book from the search results, and the Search Interface requests detailed information for that book from the Library System.
7. **Query Book Information**: The Library System then queries the Book Database again, this time for detailed information of the selected book (e.g., shelf location).
8. **Display Book Information**: The detailed book information, including the shelf on which it can be found, is sent to the Book Info Page, which displays the information to the student.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions between the student, the library's digital interfaces (Search Interface and Book Info Page), the Library System's back-end, and the Book Database necessary for providing shelf information of a book.

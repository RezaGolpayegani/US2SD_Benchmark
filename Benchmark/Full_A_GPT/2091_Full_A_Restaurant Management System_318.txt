Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to view menu groups" involves illustrating the series of steps and interactions between different system components from the moment the waiter initiates the request to the point where they receive the menu group data. Although it's challenging to represent a graphical sequence diagram in text directly, below is a PlantUML code that outlines how this process might be captured:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter as waiter
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

waiter -> ui : Select "View Menu"
ui -> server : GET /menuGroups
server -> db : Fetch menu groups
db -> server : Return menu groups
server -> ui : Menu group data
ui -> waiter : Display menu groups

@enduml
```

This simple sequence diagram follows these steps:
1. **Waiter Initiates the Request**: The waiter selects the "View Menu" option on their device, signaling the intent to view the menu groups.
2. **UI Interface**: The action taken by the waiter is translated into a GET request by the UI interface (this might be a part of a web or mobile application running on React.js or Angular as suggested in the technology stack).
3. **Backend Server Interaction**: The UI interface sends the GET request to the backend server (developed with Node.js and Express), asking for the menu group data.
4. **Database Query**: Upon receiving the request from the server, the database (which could be MongoDB or PostgreSQL) is queried for the available menu groups.
5. **Data Retrieval**: The database returns the menu group data to the backend server.
6. **Server to UI Response**: The server processes the database response and sends the menu group data back to the UI interface.
7. **Display to Waiter**: Finally, the UI interface displays the menu groups to the waiter.

This diagram assumes a simplistic view where the waiter interacts directly with a UI interface that communicates with a backend system, which in turn fetches data from a database. Real-world implementations might involve more complex interactions, such as authentication and error handling, which are not depicted in this basic diagram.

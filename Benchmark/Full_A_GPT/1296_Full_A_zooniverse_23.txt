To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As an admin, I want to prefilter nudity content," we must outline the steps involved in the process of detecting and filtering nudity in media content. This involves the admin initiating a content check, the system scanning the media, evaluating content against nudity detection algorithms, and then taking appropriate action based on the results (e.g., flagging, removing, or approving the content).

Here's how this sequence might be represented in PlantUML code, considering a simplistic approach for clarity:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Nudity Detection Service" as NDS
participant Database as DB

== Prefilter Nudity in Content ==

Admin -> CMS : Upload content/Initiate check
CMS -> NDS : Send content for scanning
activate NDS
NDS -> NDS : Analyze content
alt Content contains nudity
  NDS -> CMS : Return result (nudity detected)
  deactivate NDS
  CMS -> DB : Flag content as inappropriate
  CMS --> Admin : Notify: Content flagged
else No nudity found
  NDS -> CMS : Return result (clean)
  deactivate NDS
  CMS -> DB : Mark content as verified
  CMS --> Admin : Notify: Content approved
end

This diagram illustrates the following steps in the prefiltering process for nudity content:
1. The admin uploads content or initiates a nudity check through the Content Management System (CMS).
2. The CMS sends the content to the Nudity Detection Service (NDS) for analysis.
3. The NDS analyzes the content to determine if it contains nudity.
4. If nudity is detected, the NDS returns the result to the CMS, which then flags the content as inappropriate in the database and notifies the admin that the content has been flagged.
5. If no nudity is found, the NDS returns a clean result to the CMS, which marks the content as verified in the database and notifies the admin that the content is approved.

Note: This sequence diagram assumes a basic process. The actual implementation might involve more sophisticated interactions, especially regarding the handling of content and the interpretation of analysis results. Adjustments might be needed depending on specific project requirements and technological capabilities.

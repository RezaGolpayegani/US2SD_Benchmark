Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story—where a depositor seeks guarantees about data integrity to ensure future usability and fulfill funding requirements—in the context of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform project involves representing the interaction between system components, the depositor, and other external systems that may play a role in ensuring data integrity. Below is a text representation of a PlantUML sequence diagram that captures these interactions.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you'll need to use a PlantUML editor or an online PlantUML rendering service.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor
participant WebInterface as "Simplified Data\nDeposit Interface"
participant DataManager as "Data Management\nSystem"
participant IntegrityChecker as "Data Integrity\nChecker"
participant StorageSystem as "Secure Storage\nSystem"
participant DOIService as "DOI Minting\nService"
participant FundingBodyAPI as "Funding Body\nAPI"

== Deposit Process ==
Depositor -> WebInterface : Submit dataset
note right: Depositor attaches metadata\nand specifies licenses
WebInterface -> DataManager : Initiate deposit
DataManager -> IntegrityChecker : Validate data integrity
IntegrityChecker -> DataManager : Confirm integrity
DataManager -> StorageSystem : Store dataset securely
StorageSystem -> DataManager : Confirm storage with integrity

== DOI Minting ==
DataManager -> DOIService : Request DOI for dataset
DOIService -> DataManager : Return DOI
DataManager -> WebInterface : Display DOI to Depositor

== Funding Body Notification ==
DataManager -> FundingBodyAPI : Send dataset and DOI info
FundingBodyAPI -> DataManager : Acknowledge reception

Depositor <-- WebInterface : Deposit confirmation and DOI

**Explanation:**
- **Depositor**: The user who submits the dataset.
- **Simplified Data Deposit Interface**: The web interface through which the depositor submits their dataset.
- **Data Management System**: Manages the deposit process, ensuring datasets are stored with integrity and necessary metadata.
- **Data Integrity Checker**: Validates the integrity of the data to ensure it hasn't been corrupted or altered.
- **Secure Storage System**: Where the data is securely stored, confirming the storage along with integrity checks.
- **DOI Minting Service**: Assigns a Digital Object Identifier to the dataset, ensuring it can be uniquely identified and cited.
- **Funding Body API**: Interface for notifying the funding body about the dataset and its DOI, essential for meeting funding requirements related to data archiving.

This sequence diagram illustrates a high-level overview and may require additional detail or adaptation based on specific project requirements, technical architecture, or stakeholder needs.

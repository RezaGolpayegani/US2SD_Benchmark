To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a repoadmin, I want to provide the server SLA to data contributors" using PlantUML, you would focus on illustrating the interaction between different entities (actors, systems, etc.) involved in the process of providing Server Level Agreement (SLA) details to data contributors. The interaction focuses on the repoadmin retrieving SLA details and delivering them to the data contributors. Below is a basic representation of how this process could be illustrated using PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Repoadmin as admin
participant "EDRMS Portal" as portal
database "SLA Database" as SLADB
participant "Data Contributor" as contributor

== Provide Server SLA to Data Contributors ==

admin -> portal : Access SLA management section
portal -> SLADB : Retrieve SLA details
SLADB --> portal : SLA Data
portal --> admin : Display SLA details
admin -> portal : Select SLA details to share
admin -> contributor : Provide SLA details
contributor --> admin : Acknowledge receipt

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Repoadmin accessing the SLA management section of the EDRMS Portal. The portal then retrieves the necessary SLA details from the SLA Database, and these details are displayed back to the Repoadin. The Repoadmin selects the relevant SLA details to be shared with the Data Contributor and then provides these details directly. Finally, the Data Contributor acknowledges the receipt of the SLA details. 

Note that the actual implementation details, such as the method of providing the SLA details (e.g., email, download link, direct message), are abstracted in this high-level depiction. Depending on the specifics of the EDRMS project and its technical architecture, additional details and steps might be warranted.

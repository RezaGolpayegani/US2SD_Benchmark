To fulfill your request, I'll provide a simple PlantUML code snippet for a sequence diagram that illustrates the process of a staff member searching for a book by its subject category in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This sequence diagram demonstrates the interactions between different components such as the User Interface (UI), Controller, and Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Staff UI" as StaffUI
participant "SearchController" as Controller
database "Library Database" as LibraryDB

StaffUI -> Controller : searchBySubject(category)
activate Controller

Controller -> LibraryDB : queryBooksByCategory(category)
activate LibraryDB

LibraryDB --> Controller : return booksList
deactivate LibraryDB

Controller --> StaffUI : showBooks(booksList)
deactivate Controller

@enduml
```

In this diagram:
- The "Staff UI" represents the user interface where the staff member interacts with the system.
- The "SearchController" is a simplified representation of the backend logic controller that processes search requests.
- The "Library Database" symbolizes the data storage system where all the book information is kept, including details on subject categories.

Sequence of Events:
1. The staff member uses the "Staff UI" to initiate a search for books by a specific subject category.
2. The "Staff UI" sends this request to the "SearchController".
3. The "SearchController" then queries the "Library Database" for books matching the provided subject category.
4. The "Library Database" processes this query and returns a list of books that match the category to the "SearchController".
5. Finally, the "SearchController" passes this list back to the "Staff UI", which presents the search results to the staff member.

Please note, this is a simplified diagram to illustrate the concept. Real-world applications might involve additional layers and interactions, such as authentication, error handling, and interaction with other microservices or APIs for a comprehensive system like the CLMS described in your project.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story described above using PlantUML, we would need to illustrate the interactions between the Inspection Staff Supervisor, the system (County Services & Property Information Portal), and the inspector(s). Here's an example of how this sequence might be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Inspection Staff Supervisor" as Supervisor
participant "County Portal" as Portal
participant "Inspection Assignment System" as AssignmentSystem
participant "Inspector" as Inspector

Supervisor -> Portal : Log in to portal
activate Portal

Portal --> Supervisor : Authentication successful
Supervisor -> Portal : Navigate to inspection assignment section
activate AssignmentSystem

Portal -> AssignmentSystem : Retrieve pending inspections
AssignmentSystem --> Portal : List of pending inspections

Portal --> Supervisor : Display pending inspections
Supervisor -> Portal : Select inspection to assign
activate Inspector

Supervisor -> Portal : Select Inspector for assignment
Portal -> AssignmentSystem : Assign inspection to Inspector
AssignmentSystem -> Inspector : Notification of new inspection assignment
Inspector --> AssignmentSystem : Acknowledge assignment

AssignmentSystem --> Portal : Update assignment status
Portal --> Supervisor : Confirm inspection assignment
deactivate AssignmentSystem
deactivate Inspector

Supervisor -> Portal : Log out
deactivate Portal

@enduml
```

This PlantUML code describes the following steps in the sequence:

1. The Inspection Staff Supervisor logs in to the County Services & Property Information Portal.
2. The portal authenticates the Supervisor and shows them the inspection assignment section.
3. The Supervisor selects an inspection to assign and chooses an Inspector for the job.
4. The portal communicates with the Inspection Assignment System to assign the selected inspection to the chosen Inspector.
5. The Assignment System notifies the Inspector of their new assignment.
6. The Inspector acknowledges the assignment.
7. The Assignment System updates the inspection's assignment status and confirms the assignment to the Supervisor through the portal.
8. The Supervisor logs out of the portal.

This sequence diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions involved in assigning inspections to inspectors within the County Services & Property Information Portal, specifically from the perspective of an Inspection Staff Supervisor.

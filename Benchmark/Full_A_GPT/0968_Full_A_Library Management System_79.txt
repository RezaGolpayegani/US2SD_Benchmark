Writing a PlantUML sequence diagram requires you to consider various components that interact in the user story where a librarian wants to search for places of books. Given the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS)'s outline, a simplified version could involve interactions between the Librarian (as the user), Web Interface, Application Logic (Backend), and Database.

Before diving into PlantUML code, it's essential to understand the basic flow of this operation:

1. **Librarian Initiates Search**: The librarian uses the web interface to initiate a search for a book's location.
2. **Web Interface Forwards Query**: The query is sent to the backend system to be processed.
3. **Backend Processes Search**: The backend logic formulates the search query based on the provided criteria.
4. **Database Search**: The backend communicates with the database to find the book's location.
5. **Results Returned**: The database returns the search results to the backend.
6. **Backend Processes Results**: The backend may further process these results.
7. **Display Results**: Finally, the results are sent back to the web interface, displaying the book's location to the librarian.

Now, let's create a sequence diagram in PlantUML to represent the above process:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Application Logic" as backend
database "Database" as db

librarian -> web : Input search criteria\nfor book's location
web -> backend : Forward search query

activate web
  activate backend
    backend -> db : Fetch book location\nbased on criteria
    activate db
    db --> backend : Return book\nlocation details
    deactivate db

    backend --> web : Process and forward\nlocation details
  deactivate backend

web --> librarian : Display book\nlocation details
deactivate web

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the interactions among different components from the moment a librarian initiates a search for a book's place until the information is displayed. Keep in mind that the complexity can increase based on additional requirements, such as handling multiple databases, integrating external libraries for search efficiency, or considering error handling mechanisms. The narrative provided is a simplification to demonstrate a sequence diagram creation process for a specific functionality in the Comprehensive Library Management System.

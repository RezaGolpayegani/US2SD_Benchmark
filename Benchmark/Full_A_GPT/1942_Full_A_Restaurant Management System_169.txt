Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story **"As a manager, I want to save the menu each month"** involves illustrating the interaction between the system components (e.g. the manager interface, the menu management system, and the database) when a manager saves monthly menu updates. Below is a PlantUML code that outlines how these components interact in this scenario.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Menu Management System" as MMS
participant Database as DB

M -> MI : Accesses menu management
activate MI

MI -> MMS : Request current month's menu
activate MMS

MMS -> DB : Retrieve current menu
activate DB

DB --> MMS : Current menu data
deactivate DB

MMS --> MI : Show current menu
deactivate MMS

M -> MI : Initiates "Save Menu" for the month
activate MI

MI -> MMS : Save current menu as monthly snapshot
activate MMS

MMS -> DB : Store monthly menu snapshot
activate DB

DB --> MMS : Confirmation of saved menu
deactivate DB

MMS --> MI : Confirmation message to Manager
deactivate MMS

MI --> M : Display save confirmation
deactivate MI

This sequence diagram starts with the manager accessing the menu management through the management interface. The system then retrieves the current month's menu from the database, presents it to the manager, and upon the manager's request to save the menu for the month, it stores a snapshot of the menu in the database as a monthly record. The process ends with a confirmation message to the manager that the current menu has been successfully saved for the month.

Given your request for a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story where a librarian wants to find the bookshelf for books requested by visitors, below is a basic example of how you might represent this process. This diagram outlines the interactions between the librarian, the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the database to fulfill this specific task.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
database "CLMS Database" as Database

Librarian -> Interface : Search for book (Enter title/author)
Interface -> Database : Query for book details
activate Database
Database --> Interface : Return book information (incl. location)
deactivate Database
Interface -> Librarian : Display book information (incl. shelf number)

note right of Librarian
  The Librarian can now guide
  the visitor to the correct bookshelf
  based on the displayed information.
end note

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken when a librarian uses the Comprehensive Library Management System to locate a book for a visitor. The process starts with the librarian entering the search query (book title or author) into the CLMS interface. The system then queries the database for details about the requested book, including its location. The database responds with the necessary information, which is passed back to the librarian through the CLMS interface, including the shelf number where the book can be found.

Keep in mind, this diagram provides a high-level overview focused on the interaction flow for this specific task. Depending on the complexity of the CLMS and the technological stack, you might need to expand the details to include error handling, user authentication, and other relevant interactions.

Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate the process flow for the user story: "As a member, I want to search the books by author so that I can borrow the books of my favorite author."

This sequence diagram depicts the interactions between the system components and the user for searching books by an author.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "CLMS Database" as DB
participant "Search Controller" as Controller

Member -> Web : Enter search query (author name)
Web -> Controller : Search request (author name)
activate Controller
Controller -> DB : Query books by author
activate DB
DB --> Controller : Return search results
deactivate DB
Controller --> Web : Display search results
Web --> Member : Show books by specified author
deactivate Controller

@enduml
```

Explanation of the flow:

1. The **Member** accesses the **Web Interface** to input their search query, searching books by a specific author.
2. The **Web Interface** forwards this search request, including the author name, to the **Search Controller**.
3. The **Search Controller** processes this request and queries the **CLMS Database** for books that match the given author name.
4. The **CLMS Database** returns the search results to the **Search Controller**.
5. Finally, the **Search Controller** sends the book search results back to the **Web Interface**, which displays the list of books by the specified author to the **Member**.

This sequence diagram is line with the user story requirements and shows a straightforward process for fulfilling the book search by the author.

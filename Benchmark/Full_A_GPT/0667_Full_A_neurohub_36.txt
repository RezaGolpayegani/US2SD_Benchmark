To visualize the process of linking experimental runs to build an experiment as described in the user story from the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project, we'll outline a PlantUML sequence diagram. This sequence diagram will illustrate the interactions between the user and the system components involved in linking these experimental runs.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as u
participant "Web Interface" as w
participant "Experiment Management" as e
participant "Database" as d

u -> w : Request to link experimental runs
activate w

w -> e : Initiate link process
activate e

e -> d : Fetch available experimental runs
activate d
d --> e : List of experimental runs
deactivate d

e --> w : Display experimental runs
deactivate e

w --> u : Show experimental runs
u -> w : Selects runs to link & submit
activate w

w -> e : Link selected experimental runs
activate e

e -> d : Update experiment data with linked runs
activate d
d --> e : Confirmation of link
deactivate d

e --> w : Confirm successful link
deactivate e

w --> u : Notify success
deactivate w
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the user requesting to link experimental runs together to build an experiment, proceeding through the system's response to fetch available runs, displaying these to the user, and updating the database with the newly linked runs following the user's selections. Finally, it concludes with notifying the user of the successful linkage. 

This diagram only provides an overview and the actual implementation could include more detailed steps, especially concerning error handling, security checks, user authentication, and more specific interactions between system components.

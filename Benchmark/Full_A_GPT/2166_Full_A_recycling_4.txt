To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to be able to get the hours of each recycling facility, so that I can arrange drop-offs on my off days or during after-work hours," you can use PlantUML notation. Below is a detailed example that outlines the interactions between the user, the RecycleSmart platform, and the recycling facility database. 

You'll note that this sequence involves the user selecting a facility, requesting operating hours, and the system processing this request to return the desired information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "RecycleSmart Server" as Server
database "Recycling Facility DB" as DB

User -> UI : Enter/Select zip code
UI -> Server : Request facilities near the zip code
Server -> DB : Query facilities info
DB -> Server : Return facilities info
Server -> UI : Display facilities
User -> UI : Select a facility
UI -> Server : Request selected facility's operating hours
Server -> DB : Query operating hours
DB -> Server : Return operating hours
Server -> UI : Display operating hours
UI -> User : Show facility's operating hours

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the user entering or selecting a zip code to find nearby recycling facilities. The request is sent from the user interface (UI) to the RecycleSmart server, which then queries the Recycling Facility Database (DB) for information. Once the facilities information is returned and displayed, the user selects one facility to know its operating hours. Following this selection, the RecycleSmart server queries the operating hours for the selected facility, the database returns this information, and finally, the operating hours are displayed to the user through the interface.

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps and interactions involved for a user to retrieve a recycling facility's hours through the RecycleSmart platform. It provides a clear representation of the flow from the user's request to the delivery of the required information. 

Keep in mind that this is a simplified model. Actual implementation might include additional layers or systems such as authentication, error handling, and data caching for optimization purposes.

Given the request, let's break down the user story into interactions between entities (actors, systems, and components) that would be part of this scenario, shaping it into a sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax.

For the scope of this user story — "As a workshop attendee, I want to have a summary of what we learned, so that I can understand our next projects and how they apply to me" — we'll imagine a sequence involving the workshop attendee, the workshop facilitator, a CMS (Content Management System), and possibly a tool or process for generating or accessing the summary. 

Here's how it might look:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant WorkshopAttendee as attendee
participant WorkshopFacilitator as facilitator
participant CMS
participant "SummaryTool" as tool

note over attendee, facilitator: Workshop Ends

facilitator -> CMS : Update content with workshop details
activate CMS
CMS --> facilitator : Confirm update
deactivate CMS

group Optional: Generate Summary
    facilitator -> tool : Initiate summary generation
    activate tool
    tool -> CMS : Fetch content
    activate CMS
    CMS --> tool : Provide content
    deactivate CMS
    tool -> tool : Generate summary
    tool --> facilitator : Provide summary link
    deactivate tool
end

facilitator -> attendee : Provide access to workshop summary
note over attendee: Reviews summary

@enduml
```

Explanation:
- **Workshop Ends**: This marks the point where the actual learning or collaborative session has concluded.
- **Update content with workshop details**: The facilitator updates the CMS with information or outcomes from the workshop.
- **Optional: Generate Summary**: This is an optional process depicted to cater to the generation of a summary, which could be automated or semi-automated. The facilitator initiates this process which involves fetching workshop-related content from the CMS, generating a summary, and then providing a link or direct access to this summary back to the facilitator.
- **Provide access to workshop summary**: Finally, the facilitator shares this summary or its access link with the workshop attendees, fulfilling the user story.

This sequence diagram in PlantUML format represents a simplified view aligning with the requirements. Depending on the depth of your project's details or the specific technologies used (for example, if there's a specific API or tool for summary generation), you may need to adjust or expand upon this diagram.

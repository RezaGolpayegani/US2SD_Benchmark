Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to know who borrowed the book" involves illustrating the interactions between the librarian, the system (Comprehensive Library Management System - CLMS), and the database. Here's a representation in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant "CLMS Interface" as CI
participant "Business Logic Layer" as BLL
participant "Database" as DB

L -> CI: Requests book borrower details
activate CI
CI -> BLL: Fetch borrower details
activate BLL
BLL -> DB: Query borrower info based on book ID
activate DB
DB --> BLL: Return borrower details
deactivate DB
BLL --> CI: Provide borrower information
deactivate BLL
CI --> L: Display borrower details
deactivate CI
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows these steps:

1. **Initiation**: The librarian requests the borrower details for a specific book from the CLMS Interface.
2. **Request Processing**: The CLMS Interface then translates this request into a service call to the Business Logic Layer to fetch the required information.
3. **Query Execution**: The Business Logic Layer sends a query to the database to retrieve information about who borrowed the book, using the book's identification.
4. **Data Retrieval and Response**: The database processes the query and sends the borrower's information back to the Business Logic Layer.
5. **Information Delivery**: The Business Logic Layer passes this information back to the CLMS Interface.
6. **User Notification**: Finally, the CLMS Interface displays the borrower details to the librarian.

This sequence effectively documents the process flows required for a librarian to identify who has borrowed a particular book from the library.

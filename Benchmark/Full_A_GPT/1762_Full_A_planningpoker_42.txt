Creating a detailed sequence diagram for displaying thumbnail photos near where cards are played in the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool involves several components interacting with each backend service and frontend UI. Let's outline a sequence diagram to capture these interactions using PlantUML syntax.

We assume the following steps:
1. The participant uploads or selects a thumbnail photo.
2. The system processes the photo.
3. The photo is associated with the participant's user profile.
4. During an estimation game, when the participant plays a card, their thumbnail photo is displayed near the card.

Here's a basic representation in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Participant" as participant
participant "Frontend UI" as ui
participant "Profile Service" as profile
participant "Game Service" as game
database "Database" as db

participant -> ui: Select/Upload Thumbnail Photo
ui -> profile: UpdateProfileWithPhoto()
activate profile
profile -> db: SavePhotoInfo()
activate db
db -> db: StorePhoto()
db --> profile: PhotoStored()
deactivate db
profile --> ui: Confirmation()
deactivate profile
ui --> participant: DisplayConfirmation()

participant -> ui: PlayCard()
ui -> game: DisplayCardWithThumbnail()
activate game
game -> db: GetParticipantThumbnail()
activate db
db -> db: RetrievePhotoInfo()
db --> game: PhotoInfo()
deactivate db
game --> ui: RenderCardAndPhoto()
ui --> participant: ShowCardWithThumbnail()
deactivate game

This sequence diagram starts with the participant choosing to select or upload a thumbnail photo via the Frontend UI, which then communicates with the Profile Service to update the participant's profile with the new photo information. The Profile Service interacts with the Database to save this photo information. Once the photo is stored, the Profile Service sends a confirmation back to the Frontend UI, which in turn notifies the participant.

Later, when the participant plays a card in an estimation game, the Frontend UI requests the Game Service to display the card along with the participant's thumbnail photo. The Game Service retrieves the participant's thumbnail photo information from the Database and instructs the Frontend UI to render the card and photo together, which is then displayed to the participant.

Note that this is a simplified diagram; the actual implementation may involve additional steps or services, especially regarding security, data validation, and error handling. Also, considering the compatibility requirements mentioned in the project description, the implementation would need to ensure support for the various browsers and possibly adjust how images are processed and displayed based on those compatibilities.

Given the complex nature of integrating Active Directory (AD) authentication into an archival digital management system, a PlantUML sequence diagram can help visualize the interactions between components. The following sequence illustrates how an administrator configures the system to authenticate a user via Active Directory credentials.

```
@startuml
participant User
participant Browser
participant WebClient
participant AuthenticationModule
participant ActiveDirectory

User -> Browser : Enter username and password
Browser -> WebClient : Send login credentials
WebClient -> AuthenticationModule : Request authentication
AuthenticationAPIView -> ActiveDirectory : Validate credentials
alt Successful Authentication
    ActiveDirectory -> AuthenticationModule : Return Success + User Details
    AuthenticationModule -> WebClient : Generate session/token
    WebClient -> Browser : Display successful login message
else Failed Authentication
    ActiveDirectory -> AuthenticationModule : Return Failure
    AuthenticationModule -> WebClient : Error message
    WebClient -> Browser : Display login error
end
Browser -> User : Show result
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram
- **User**: Initiates the login process by entering their Active Directory username and password into the browser interface.
- **Browser**: Acts as the medium through which the user interacts with the web client, forwarding the login credentials.
- **WebClient**: Represents the front-end component of the archival digital management system, which sends authentication requests.
- **AuthenticationModule**: Serves as the back-end logic that processes login requests. It receives credentials from the WebClient and interacts with Active Directory.
- **ActiveDirectory**: The directory service that validates usernames and passwords against its stored credentials.

### Steps Illustrated in the Sequence:
1. **User Authentication Initiation**: The user submits their credentials via the web browser.
2. **Credentials Forwarding**: The browser forwards these credentials to the WebClient.
3. **Authentication Request**: The WebClient, in turn, sends the authentication request to the AuthenticationModule.
4. **Active Directory Validation**: The AuthenticationModule contacts Active Directory to validate the submitted credentials.
5. **Authentication Response**:
    - **Successful Authentication**: If the credentials are valid, Active Directory informs the AuthenticationModule, which then instructs the WebClient to generate a session or token for the user, ultimately displaying a success message to the user through the browser.
    - **Failed Authentication**: If authentication fails, the AuthenticationModule sends an error message back through the chain, leading to the display of a login error to the user.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the authentication process with Active Directory within an enhanced digital archive management system configuration. It simplifies several complex background processes, including security and session management, which are critical for protecting the system and its archived materials.

Certainly! Below is an example of a PlantUML sequence diagram for the scenario where a Publisher wishes to undelete a previously deleted data package, making it visible again. This sequence demonstrates the interaction between different components within the system to accomplish the undelete operation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "API Gateway" as API
participant "Data Management Service" as DataManagement
participant "Data Storage" as DataStorage
control "Authorization Service" as Auth
database "Audit Log" as Audit

Publisher -> UI: Select undelete option
UI -> API: Request to undelete data package (package_id)
API -> Auth: Verify Publisher's identity & permissions
Auth --> API: Verification successful
API -> DataManagement: Request undeletion (package_id)
DataManagement -> DataStorage: Retrieve deleted package metadata (package_id)
DataStorage --> DataManagement: Deleted package metadata
DataManagement -> DataStorage: Update package status (visible)
DataStorage --> DataManagement: Undeletion confirmation
DataManagement -> Audit: Log undeletion action (package_id, Publisher)
Audit --> DataManagement: Log successful
DataManagement --> API: Undeletion success response
API --> UI: Display undeletion success message
UI --> Publisher: Confirmation of data package visibility

This diagram illustrates the sequence of actions initiated by a Publisher who wants to revert the deletion of a data package. After selecting the undelete option:

1. The Publisher's request is captured by the UI interface and forwarded to the API Gateway.
2. The API Gateway then verifies the Publisher's identity and permissions through the Authorization Service.
3. Once verified, the request to undelete the data package is sent to the Data Management Service.
4. This service retrieves the deleted package's metadata from the Data Storage and then updates its status back to visible.
5. An undeletion action is logged in the Audit Log.
6. Finally, a success message is fed back to the Publisher through the UI interface.

This simplified sequence diagram covers the main interactions without detailing specific UI elements or API endpoint URLs, which would be necessary for a fully implemented solution.

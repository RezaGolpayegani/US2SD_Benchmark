Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story you provided. This diagram assumes the presence of a web-based interface for the researcher to interact with, a backend server to process requests, and a database system for storing experiment metadata and inputs. It illustrates the process of a researcher logging into Neurohub, navigating to the experiment section, and uploading inputs for an experiment, thereby ensuring the provenance of the results.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

actor Researcher as researcher
participant "Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Experiment Database" as database

== Authentication ==
researcher -> webInterface : Access Neurohub
webInterface -> backend : Request authentication
backend -> database : Validate user credentials
database -> backend : Credentials valid
backend -> webSecret Window: Access granted
webInterface -> researcher : Display dashboard

== Navigating to Experiment Section ==
researcher -> webInterface : Navigate to 'My Experiments'
webInterface -> backend : Request user's experiments
backend -> database : Fetch experiments list
database -> backend : Return experiments
backend -> webInterface : Display experiments list
webInterface -> researcher : Show 'My Experiments' section

== Uploading Experiment Inputs ==
researcher -> webInterface : Select 'Upload Inputs'
webInterface -> researcher : Show upload form
researcher -> webInterface : Submit input files and metadata
webInterface -> backend : Submit input files and experiment metadata
backend -> database : Store input files and metadata
database -> backend : Confirm storage
backend -> webInterface : Upload successful
webInterface -> researcher : Display success message

== Verifying Upload and Provenance ==
researcher -> webInterface : Request input files list
webInterface -> backend : Fetch uploaded inputs for experiment
backend -> database : Retrieve input details
database -> backend : Return input details
backend -> webInterface : Display inputs list
webInterface -> researcher : Show experiment inputs with metadata

This sequence diagram outlines the vital steps a researcher would take to store all inputs for an experiment via the Neurohub platform. Starting from authentication, navigating through the interface to the experiment section, uploading the input files along with their metadata, and finally verifying the upload to ensure the provenance of the results can be confirmed at any later point.

To visualize this PlantUML diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML syntax. This provides a visual representation of the interactions and can be a valuable part of the project documentation, offering insight into the specific use case of storing experiment inputs within the Neurohub platform.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As an owner, I want to see comments of employees for each order so that I can learn comments of customers about the products in the menu" involves several actors and components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This sequence diagram will outline the flow of interactions from the moment the owner requests to view comments until the comments are displayed.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Owner
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Owner -> UI : Request to view comments
UI -> Server : Fetch comments for orders
Server -> DB : Query comments and related orders
DB --> Server : Return comments data
Server --> UI : Provide comments and orders information
UI --> Owner : Display comments

### Description of the Sequence:

1. **Owner Requests to View Comments**: The owner initiates the process by requesting to view comments on the UI Interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **UI Interface Processes Request**: The UI Interface takes this request and sends it to the Backend Server to fetch the necessary comments for each order.

3. **Backend Server Queries the Database**: The Backend Server processes this request and queries the Database for comments linked with customer orders.

4. **Database Retrieves Comments**: The Database searches for the requested data (comments related to each order) and retrieves this information, sending it back to the Backend Server.

5. **Backend Server Processes Data**: Upon receiving the comments data from the Database, the Backend Server processes and structures the information to be easily understandable and viewable.

6. **UI Interface Displays Comments**: Finally, the UI Interface receives the processed comments and orders information from the Backend Server and displays it to the owner, fulfilling the request.

### Notes:
- **Security and Privacy**: It's important to implement access control and data protection mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users (in this case, the owner and perhaps some management-level employees) can view these customer comments.
- **Scalability**: As the system grows, both the Backend Server and Database should be designed to efficiently handle an increasing volume of comments and orders data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Fetching and displaying the comments should be optimized for performance to ensure that the process is smooth and does not cause delays in the UI Interface.

This diagram represents a high-level overview of the process. Implementations may vary depending on specific project requirements, technical specifications, and the detailed design of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

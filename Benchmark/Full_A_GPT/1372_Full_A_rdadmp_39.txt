Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the researcher, the DMPTool, and other components involved in the process of storing agreements related to third-party data. Below is an example of how this sequence might look. Note that for brevity and clarity, some steps might be simplified.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "DMPTool Interface" as DMP
database "Metadata Repository" as MetaRepo
participant "External Metadata Tool" as ExtMeta
participant "Legal Compliance Module" as LegalModule

Researcher -> DMP: Access DMPTool
activate DMP

DMP -> DMP: Authenticate Researcher
DMP -> Researcher: Display Dashboard

Researcher -> DMP: Select Project
DMP -> Researcher: Request Agreement Details
Researcher -> DMP: Inputs Agreement Information\n(Including Third-Party Data References)

DMP -> ExtMeta: Fetch External Metadata
activate ExtMeta
ExtMeta -> MetaRepo: Query Metadata
activate MetaRepo
MetaRepo -> ExtMeta: Return Metadata
deactivate MetaRepo
ExtMeta -> DMP: Return Metadata
deactivate ExtMeta

DMP -> LegalModule: Validate Agreement Compliance
activate LegalModule
LegalModule -> LegalModule: Check Legal Requirements\n and Data Usage Policies
LegalModule -> DMP: Compliance Status
deactivate LegalModule

alt If Agreement is Compliant
    DMP -> MetaRepo: Store Agreement Metadata
    activate MetaRepo
    MetaRepo -> DMP: Confirmation
    deactivate MetaRepo
    DMP -> Researcher: Display Success Message\n(Agreement Stored & Compliant)
else If Agreement not Compliant
    DMP -> Researcher: Display Error Message\n(Non-Compliance Issues)
end

deactivate DMP

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

1. **Researcher Accesses DMPTool:** The researcher logs into the DMPTool to initiate the process.
2. **Authentication and Dashboard Display:** The DMPTool authenticates the researcher and displays the project dashboard.
3. **Select Project and Input Agreement Details:** The researcher selects the relevant project and inputs details related to the agreement for third-party data, including references to the data.
4. **Fetch and Return External Metadata:** The DMPTool communicates with an external metadata tool to fetch metadata related to the third-party data. This information is retrieved and used to enrich the agreement details.
5. **Validate Agreement Compliance:** The legal compliance module checks the agreement against legal requirements and data usage policies to ensure compliance.
6. **Store Agreement Metadata:** If the agreement meets all compliance standards, its details are stored in the metadata repository, and the researcher is notified of the successful storage and compliance. If not compliant, the researcher is informed of the issues to address.

This sequence diagram outlines the key steps involved when a researcher wants to store agreements relating to third party data in a project using the DMPTool, highlighting the system's interactions and the flow of information.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves mapping out the interactions between different components of the system and the Agency User when they aim to understand file-level errors better. Below is a representation of how these interactions could be diagrammed in PlantUML format. Note that this is a blueprint and might need adjustments based on the specific implementation details of the Broker platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AgencyUser as user
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Validation Module" as Validator
participant "Error Handling Module" as ErrorHandler
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Error Log" as ErrorLog

user -> UI : Request Error Details
UI -> Validator : Trigger Error Check
activate Validator

Validator -> DB : Fetch Submission Data
activate DB
DB --> Validator : Submission Data
deactivate DB

Validator -> ErrorHandler : Validate Data
activate ErrorHandler

ErrorHandler -> DB : Query Error Details
activate DB
DB --> ErrorHandler : Error Metadata
deactivate DB

ErrorHandler -> ErrorLog : Log Errors/details
activate ErrorLog
ErrorLog --> ErrorHandler : Logging Confirmation
deactivate ErrorLog

ErrorHandler --> Validator : Error Info
deactivate ErrorHandler

Validator --> UI : Validation Results with Errors
UI --> user : Display Error Details
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Agency User requesting the details of file-level errors through the UI Interface. The UI Interface then triggers a process in the Validation Module to check for errors. The Validation Module fetches the submission data from the Database and validates this data through the Error Handling Module.

The Error Handling Module performs a series of actions: it queries the Database for detailed error metadata, logs these errors/details in an Error Log system, and returns the error information back to the Validation Module. Finally, the Validation Module sends the validation results, including any identified errors, back to the UI Interface, which then displays these details to the Agency User.

Adjustments and more specific sequences might be necessary depending on actual system architectures, the complexity of the errors, and the level of detail required by users.

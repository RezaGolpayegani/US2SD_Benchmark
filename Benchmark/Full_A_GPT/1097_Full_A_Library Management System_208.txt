Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story – where a library manager wants to filter delayed returns to contact related members for the books' return – involves illustrating the interaction between the system components, the library manager, and possibly the database where the delayed returns are tracked. 

The PlantUML code below represents such a scenario, focusing on the process flow from the moment the library manager initiates the action to filter delayed returns up to receiving the list of delayed items and the related member details.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Back-end System" as Backend
database "Library Database" as DB

Manager -> Interface : Request to filter delayed returns
Interface -> Backend : Query to retrieve delayed returns
Backend -> DB : Select delayed items with member details
DB -> Backend : Return result set
Backend -> Interface : Display delayed returns with members
Interface -> Manager : Show delayed returns and member contacts

note right of Manager: Manager decides to \ncontact members directly

This diagram starts with the manager making a request through the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) interface to filter out the delayed returns. The sequence proceeds with the system's back-end sending a query to the library's database to fetch the information about delayed items and their respective borrower's details. This information is then returned to the back-end system, which passes it on to be displayed to the manager through the interface. 

Please note, the actual implementation could vary based on the database schema, the programming languages used, and the specific technologies involved in the back-end and front-end of the CLMS. This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interaction flow for the specified user story.

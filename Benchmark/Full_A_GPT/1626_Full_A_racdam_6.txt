Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided in PlantUML format involves understanding the interaction between different entities (objects) for the specific task of setting a future date for restriction removal on a digital file within an archival system. Here is how such a sequence might be described in PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "File Management System" as FMS
participant "Database" as DB

A -> UI : Select file(s) for update
activate UI
UI -> FMS : Request file details
activate FMS
FMS -> DB : Query file details
activate DB
DB --> FMS : Return file details
deactivate DB
FMS --> UI : Display file details
deactivate FMS
UI --> A : Show file details
deactivate UI
A -> UI : Set removal date for restrictions
activate UI
UI -> FMS : Update file with removal date
activate FMS
FMS -> DB: Update file details
activate DB
DB --> FMS : Confirm update
deactivate DB
FMS --> UI : Update confirmation
deactivate FMS
UI --> A : Display confirmation message
deactivate UI
@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram demonstrates the flow starting from the archivist's action to select files for updating restriction details, through interactions with the system's user interface (UI), the file management system (FMS), and the database (DB) to finally receiving a confirmation of the update. Please note that for simplicity, authentication and authorization steps before performing actions are not explicitly shown but can be assumed to be part of the interactions with the UI and the FMS.

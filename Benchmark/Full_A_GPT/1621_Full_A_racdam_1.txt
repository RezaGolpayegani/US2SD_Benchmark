For your request to create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of an archivist wanting to apply a license or rights statement to a file, here's a representation in PlantUML format. This example assumes a basic interaction between the archivist and the digital archive management system, focusing on the licensing part of the process. Adjust and expand the diagram based on more specific requirements or technologies involved in your project.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Licensing Module" as L
participant "Database" as D

A -> W : Select file(s) for licensing
activate W

W -> L : Request licensing options
activate L

L -> D : Retrieve available licenses
activate D
D --> L : Return licenses
deactivate D

L --> W : Show licenses
deactivate L

A -> W : Choose specific license/rights statement
activate W

W -> L : Apply chosen license to file(s)
activate L

L -> D : Update file(s) with chosen license
activate D
D --> L : Confirm license update
deactivate D

L --> W : Confirm successful application
deactivate L
W --> A : Show success message
deactivate W

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Archivist selecting files to apply a license or rights statement. The web interface then interacts with the Licensing Module to fetch available licenses stored in the database. Once the options are presented, and the Archivist makes a selection, the Licensing Module updates the chosen file(s) in the database with the new license information. The process ends with the Archivist being notified of the successful application of the license/rights statement.

Keep in mind that depending on the complexity of your digital archive management system, interactions with other modules or systems (like authentication, logging, or audit trails for legal compliance) might also be necessary but are not included here to keep the sequence understandable and focused on the primary action of applying a license.

Generating a full-fledged and detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story ("As an employee, I want to see the current stock") in a comprehensive system like a Restaurant Management and Operations System involves understanding the flow of messages between different parts of the system. Here is a simplified Plant UML representation of how an employee could check the current stock within such a system. This scenario assumes the employee interacts through a user interface, the request is processed by the backend server, and finally, data is fetched from the database.

Please note, this example focuses on the sequence of actions and interactions, and actual implementations can vary significantly depending on specific project requirements, system architecture, and technology stack.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "UI Layer" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

== Check Current Stock Flow ==

Employee -> UI : Selects option to view current stock
UI -> Server : GET request /currentStock
Server -> DB : Query current stock information
DB --> Server : Return stock data
Server --> UI : Current stock response
UI --> Employee : Display stock information

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes the following steps in the process:

1. **Employee Interaction**: The employee initiates the process by selecting an option to view the current stock levels through the user interface (UI) of the system. This could be on a dashboard or through a specific section of the application dedicated to inventory management.

2. **UI to Server Request**: Following the employee's action, the UI layer sends a GET request to the backend server, specifically targeting an endpoint (e.g., `/currentStock`) designed to handle stock inquiries.

3. **Server Processing**: Upon receiving the request, the backend server processes it and makes a query to the database to retrieve current stock information. This query is formulated based on the system's database schema and the specific data required (e.g., product IDs, quantities).

4. **Database Interaction**: The database processes the server's query and returns the requested stock data. This includes detailed information about each item's current quantity, possible re-order levels, and any other relevant stock-related data.

5. **Server Response**: With the stock information retrieved from the database, the backend server then formats a response to be understandable and usable by the UI layer, which might include converting raw data into a structured format (e.g., JSON).

6. **UI Presentation**: Finally, the UI layer receives the server's response and presents the current stock information to the employee in an easily digestible format, which could involve tabular displays, graphs, or other visualizations that aid in understanding the stock levels.

Keep in mind, this example is simplified to illustrate the process of an employee checking the current stock levels. In a real-world scenario, additional steps like authentication, error handling, and data caching might be necessary to ensure the system's security, efficiency, and resilience.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided involves illustrating how different system components and actors interact over time to fulfill the requirement of scheduling more coworking slots. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that captures the process from the perspective of a team member requesting more coworking slots, and the system components involved in handling this request.

Please, note that to render this PlantUML code, you would need to use a PlantUML processor or an online tool that supports PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant TeamMember
participant CollaborationPlatform
participant CalendarService
participant NotificationService

TeamMember -> CollaborationPlatform: RequestIncreasedCoworkingSlots()
activate CollaborationPlatform

CollaborationPlatform -> CalendarService: CheckForAvailableSlots()
activate CalendarService
CalendarService --> CollaborationPlatform: AvailableSlotsDetails
deactivate CalendarService

CollaborationPlatform -> TeamMember: DisplayAvailableSlots(AvailableSlotsDetails)
TeamMember -> CollaborationPlatform: SelectDesiredSlots(SelectedSlots)
CollaborationPlatform -> CalendarService: ScheduleSlots(SelectedSlots)
activate CalendarService
CalendarService --> CollaborationPlatform: Confirmation(ScheduledSlots)
deactivate CalendarService

CollaborationPlatform -> NotificationService: SendConfirmationToTeam(ScheduledSlots)
activate NotificationService
NotificationService --> TeamMember: ConfirmationNotification(ScheduledSlots)
deactivate NotificationTService

deactivate CollaborationPlatform
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Diagram Steps:

1. **TeamMember -> CollaborationPlatform**: The team member initiates the process by requesting more coworking slots through the collaboration platform.

2. **CollaborationPlatform -> CalendarService**: The collaboration platform checks with the calendar service to identify available coworking slots.

3. **CalendarService --> CollaborationPlatform**: The calendar service returns details of available slots to the collaboration platform.

4. **CollaborationPlatform -> TeamMember**: The available slots are displayed to the team member through the collaboration platform.

5. **TeamMember -> CollaborationPlatform**: The team member selects desired slots from the available options.

6. **CollaborationPlatform -> CalendarService**: The selected slots are scheduled with the calendar service by the collaboration platform.

7. **CalendarService --> CollaborationPlatform**: The calendar service confirms the scheduled slots and sends a confirmation back to the collaboration platform.

8. **CollaborationPlatform -> NotificationService**: The collaboration platform instructs the notification service to send a confirmation to the team regarding the newly scheduled slots.

9. **NotificationService --> TeamMember**: The team member receives a confirmation notification about the scheduled coworking slots.

This sequence diagram captures the basic interactions involved in scheduling more coworking slots based on the user story provided. Adjustments and additions may be required based on the specific implementation details of the system components (Collaboration Platform, Calendar Service, Notification Service) and their capabilities.

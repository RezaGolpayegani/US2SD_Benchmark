Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interactions between the archivist, the system (Digital Archive Management System), and possibly external systems or databases in a sequential order. Given the complexity of such systems, the diagram will simplify interactions focusing on the key steps involved in determining if a photo has already been scanned and then licensing it to a researcher.

Below is a simplified PlantUML code that represents these interactions in a sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as DAMS
database "Archival Collection\nDatabase" as DB
participant "Licensing Module" as LM

A -> DAMS : Searches for photo
DAMS -> DB : Query photo records
DB --> DAMS : Return photo records
DAMS --> A : Display search results

alt Photo has been scanned
    A -> DAMS : Select photo
    DAMS -> DB : Retrieve photo details
    DB --> DAMS : Photo details
    DAMS --> A : Display photo details\n(Scanned status: Yes)
    
    A -> LM : Request to license photo
    LM -> DB : Check licensing conditions
    DB --> LM : Licensing conditions met
    LM --> A : Generate license agreement
    
    A -> DAMS : License photo to researcher
    DAMS -> DB : Update photo record\n(Add license details)
    DB --> DAMS : Confirm update
    DAMS --> A : Confirm photo licensed
    
else Photo not scanned
    DAMS --> A : Display message\n(Photo not scanned)
end

This code outlines the following process:
1. **Photo Search**: The archivist searches for a photo in the Digital Archive Management System.
2. **Query Database**: The system queries the Archival Collection Database for photo records.
3. **Display Results**: Search results are displayed to the archivist.
4. **Photo Scanned?**: If the photo has already been scanned, its details are retrieved and displayed. If not, a message indicating the photo hasn't been scanned is shown.
5. **Licensing Request**: The archivist requests to license the scanned photo.
6. **Check Licensing Conditions**: The system checks if licensing conditions are met.
7. **Generate License**: A license agreement is generated and displayed to the archivist.
8. **License Photo**: The archivist licenses the photo to the researcher, and the system updates the photo record with license details.

Remember, this is a high-level representation. Real-world scenarios might involve additional steps or systems, such as digital rights management, user authentication, detailed metadata management, or integration with external content management systems.

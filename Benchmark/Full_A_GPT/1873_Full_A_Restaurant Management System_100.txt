Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to change prices" involves outlining the interactions between the manager and the different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This sequence diagram will illustrate the process from the manager deciding to change a menu item's price to the system updating and reflecting this change across the platform.

Please note, sequence diagrams are textual descriptions in PlantUML, and converting this to a visual diagram would require running the code through a PlantUML processor or compatible tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Server/Backend" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> MI : Initiate price change
activate MI

MI -> Backend : Request price update (itemID, newPrice)
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Update item price
activate DB

DB -> Backend : Confirm price update
deactivate DB

Backend -> MI : Price update successful
deactivated Backend

MI -> Manager : Display success message
deactivate MI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Manager initiating a price change through the Management Interface. The Management Interface sends a request to the Backend/Server to update the price of a specific menu item (identified by `itemID`) to a `newPrice`. The server then processes this request and updates the item price in the Database. Upon successful update, the database confirms the price update to the Backend, which in turn notifies the Management Interface. Finally, the Management Interface displays a success message to the Manager, confirming that the price has been changed.

This is a simplified version focusing on the primary flow of changing an item's price. Depending on the system's complexity, error handling, authentication, authorization, and more detailed interactions may also be part of the sequence but are not included here to maintain clarity and focus on the main goal of the user story.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a cook, I want to inform waiters after the food is ready, so that the waiter can serve the food" involves several actors and components within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Here is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines the interactions involved in this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook
participant "Kitchen Management Module" as KMM
participant "Order Tracking System" as OTS
participant NotificationService
participant Waiter

Cook -> KMM: Update dish status to 'Ready'
KMM -> OTS: Notify dish is ready
OTS -> NotificationService: Trigger notification for Waiter
NotificationService -> Waiter: Display 'Food Ready' notification

alt Food Pickup Acknowledgement
    Waiter -> NotificationService: Acknowledge 'Food Ready' notification
    NotificationService -> OTS: Update order status to 'Serving'
    OTS -> Cook: Notify Waiter is serving the food
else No Acknowledgement
    NotificationService -> NotificationService: Retry notification
end

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Cook**: The cook updates the status of the dish to 'Ready' in the Kitchen Management Module, indicating the meal has been prepared.

2. **Kitchen Management Module (KMM)**: This module receives the update from the cook and then notifies the Order Tracking System (OTS) that the dish is ready.

3. **Order Tracking System (OTS)**: Upon receiving the update from the KMM, the OTS communicates with the NotificationService to trigger a notification for the assigned waiter.

4. **NotificationService**: This service handles sending a 'Food Ready' notification to the specific waiter responsible for serving the food.

5. **alt Food Pickup Acknowledgement**: This is a decision point where if the waiter acknowledges the 'Food Ready' notification (for example, by accepting it on a device), the NotificationService will update the OTS about the acknowledgement, and the OTS will then notify the Cook that the Waiter is on the way to serve the food.

6. **else No Acknowledgement**: If there is no acknowledgement from the waiter (within a predefined time frame), the NotificationService will attempt to resend the notification, ensuring the waiter is informed.

This sequence diagram visualizes the detailed interactions between the cook, the system modules, and the waiter for the process of informing the waiter when food is ready, emphasizing the importance of efficient communication within the restaurant operations to ensure a smooth dining experience for the customers.

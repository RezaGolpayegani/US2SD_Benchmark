Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to view genres of books so that I can find some materials for my research" involves illustrating the interactions between the system's components from the user initiating the action to the system responding with the relevant information. Here's how this can be laid out in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "CLMS System" as CLMS
participant "Database" as DB

== View Book Genres for Research ==
member -> UI : Selects "View Genres"
UI -> CLMS : Request to list book genres
CLMS -> DB : Query genres
DB -> CLMS : Return list of genres
CLMS -> UI : Display genres
UI -> member : Shows list of book genres
@enduml
```

This PlantUML code snippet visually represents the sequence of actions when a library member wants to view the genres of books available in the library to aid their research. The sequence flows as follows:

1. **Member Interaction:** The member initiates the process by selecting the option to view book genres through the user interface (UI), commonly implemented as a button or link on the library system's webpage or mobile app.

2. **UI to System Request:** This action triggers a request from the UI to the backend Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to retrieve a list of available book genres.

3. **Database Query:** The CLMS, upon receiving the request, queries the database to fetch the available genres. This process involves executing a database operation that selects distinct book genres from the stored book details.

4. **Data Retrieval:** The database responds to the CLMS query with a list of the different book genres it has records for.

5. **Display Information:** The CLMS system then sends the list of genres back to the UI, which in turn displays them to the member.

6. **Member View:** The member is presented with a list of genres, helping them to narrow down their search for materials relevant to their research.

This diagram captures the essential steps and interactions for the described user story, providing a clear overview of the process flow within the system for viewing book genres.

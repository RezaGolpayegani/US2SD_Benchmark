Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of an archivist wanting to assign a unique identifier to a resource component in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interaction between different system components and actors to achieve that feature. Below is a simplified representation of how this process could be reflected in a UML sequence diagram.

Please note, this sequence diagram assumes a basic understanding of how archival management systems like this might operate and simplifies the interaction for clarity. Your actual system may involve more detailed or different steps, depending on its architecture and functionalities.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as archivist
participant FrontendInterface as ui
participant AuthenticationModule as auth
participant ComponentManagement as compMan
participant Database as db

archivist -> ui : Select "Edit Resource Component"
ui -> auth : Verify access rights
auth -> ui : Access granted

ui -> compMan : Request unique ID assignment form
compMan -> ui : Display form on UI

archivist -> ui : Enter unique ID and submit
ui -> compMan : Validate input & process assignment
compMan -> db : Update resource component with unique ID
db -> compMan : Confirm update
compMan -> ui : Confirm unique ID assignment
ui -> archivist : Display success message

```

This diagram is a basic flow and doesn't account for all possible checks and balances (like validation of the unique ID to ensure it doesn't already exist, error handling, etc.). 

### Explanation of Steps:
1. **Archivist Interaction**: The archivist initiates the process by selecting the option to edit a Resource Component in the frontend interface.
2. **Access Verification**: The system verifies the archivist's access rights to edit resource components.
3. **Unique ID Assignment Form**: Upon access verification, the Component Management system provides a form for entering a new unique ID.
4. **Unique ID Submission**: The archivist enters the desired unique ID into the form and submits it.
5. **Validation and Processing**: The Component Management system validates the input to ensure it meets the criteria (not shown for simplicity) and then processes the assignment.
6. **Database Update**: The new unique ID is stored in the database, associating it with the specified resource component.
7. **Confirmation**: Once the database confirms the update, the Component Management system sends a success message to the UI, which in turn informs the archivist of the successful ID assignment.

### Adaptation:
- Details like authentication and specific validation steps can be more elaborate depending on the system's complexity.
- The actual database operation might involve multiple steps, especially if transactional integrity is critical (not shown here for simplicity).
- Advanced scenarios, such as handling concurrent edits or validating the uniqueness of the ID across a distributed system, are not covered in this outline. 

This diagram can be a starting point, and based on your project's specific requirements and architecture, it might need adjustments or expansions.

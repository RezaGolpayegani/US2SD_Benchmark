Given your request, I’ve created a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate the steps a staff member would undertake during the staff review process for an application's compliance with the Zoning Ordinance. This sequence diagram assumes interaction among the staff member, the portal system, an application database, and potentially an external GIS system for spatial compliance checks.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as Staff
participant "Portal System" as Portal
database "Application Database" as Database
participant "GIS System" for spatial compliance checks(optional) as GIS

== Perform Staff Review to Validate Zoning Compliance ==

Staff -> Portal : Request Application for Review
Portal -> Database : Query Application Details
Database --> Portal : Return Application Details
Portal --> Staff : Show Application Details

Staff -> Portal : Request Zoning Ordinance Compliance Check
Portal -> Database : Retrieve Zoning Requirements
Database --> Portal : Return Zoning Requirements

Portal -> GIS : Request Spatial Compliance Check(optional)
GIS --> Portal : Return Spatial Compliance Result

Portal -> Portal : Assess Compliance with Zoning Ordinance
Portal --> Staff : Display Compliance Assessment

alt Compliance Satisfied
    Staff -> Portal : Approve Application
    Portal -> Database : Update Application Status to Approved
    Database --> Portal : Confirm Status Update
    Portal --> Staff : Display Approval Confirmation
else Compliance Not Satisfied
    Staff -> Portal : Request Additional Information/Reject Application
    alt Request Additional Information
        Portal -> Database : Update Application Status to Additional Information Requested
        Database --> Portal : Confirm Status Update
        Portal --> Staff : Display Request Confirmation
    else Reject Application
        Portal -> Database : Update Application Status to Denied
        Database --> Portal : Confirm Status Update
        Portal --> Staff : Display Denial Confirmation
    end
end

To use this diagram, you'll need a PlantUML environment or tool that can render PlantUML syntax into a visual sequence diagram. The sequence starts with the staff member requesting an application for review and ends with the application being either approved, denied, or marked as needing additional information based on the compliance check with the Zoning Ordinance. Optional steps, like spatial compliance checks using a GIS system, are included and can be adapted based on the specific requirements and capabilities of the county’s system infrastructure.

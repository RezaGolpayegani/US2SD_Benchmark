Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating how different system components interact for the "historical FPDS data loader" feature, focusing on including both extracted historical data and FPDS feed data. Please note that to fully customize this to your system's architecture, you might need to adjust component names and interactions based on your actual implementation.

This sequence diagram is a simple representation and may require adjustments to fit the detailed workings of your platform:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant "Broker Platform" as Broker
database "Historical FPDS Data" as HistoricalFPDS
database "FPDS Feed" as FPDSFeed
database "Data Loader" as DataLoader

Developer -> Broker: Request data loading process
Broker -> HistoricalFPDS: Retrieve historical data
HistoricalFPDS --> Broker: Return historical data
Broker -> FPDSFeed: Access current FPDS feed data
FPDSFeed --> Broker: Return FPDS feed data
Broker -> DataLoader: Initiate data merge process
DataLoader -> DataLoader: Merge historical and feed data
DataLoader --> Broker: Confirm data loading completion
Broker --> Developer: Notify data loading success

### Explanation:

1. **Developer initiates the process:** The sequence starts with the Developer requesting the data loading process on the Broker platform.

2. **Retrieving historical data:** The Broker then retrieves historical FPDS data from the respective database or storage.

3. **Accessing current FPDS feed data:** Simultaneously, the Broker platform accesses the current FPDS feed data from its source.

4. **Data merge process:** With both sets of data retrieved, the Broker platform instructs the Data Loader to begin the merging process, integrating historical data and current FPDS feed data.

5. **Completion and notification:** Once the merge process is successfully completed, the Data Loader notifies the Broker platform, which in turn, informs the Developer of the successful data loading.

Remember, this representation is a simplified model meant to illustrate the core interactions based on the provided user story. Depending on the complexity of your actual data processing and validation logic, additional steps and participants (such as specific data validation services, additional databases, or error handling mechanisms) might be necessary to include for a more accurate depiction.

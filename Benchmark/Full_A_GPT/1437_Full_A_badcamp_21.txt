Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves outlining the interactions between the authenticated user, the website front-end, and the back-end systems, including the database and payment gateway.

Given your user story, "As an authenticated user, I want to find a link on the sponsorships page to become a $350 level sponsor, so that I can pay for and become a sponsor role," here's a basic PlantUML sequence diagram to represent the process:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor AuthenticatedUser as "Authenticated User"
participant SponsorshipsPage as "Sponsorships Page"
participant BackendAPI as "Backend API"
database DB as "Database"
participant PaymentGateway as "Payment Gateway"

== Find Sponsorship Link ==
AuthenticatedUser -> SponsorshipsPage: Visit Sponsorships Page
SponsorshipsPage -> BackendAPI: Request Sponsorship Levels
BackendAPI -> DB: Query Sponsorship Options
DB -> BackendAPI: Sponsorship Details
BackendAPI -> SponsorshipsPage: $350 Sponsorship Link
SponsorshipsPage -> AuthenticatedUser: Display Sponsorship Options

== Initiate Sponsorship ==
AuthenticatedUser -> SponsorshipsPage: Select $350 Sponsorship
SponsorshipsPage -> BackendAPI: Select $350 Level
BackendAPI -> PaymentGateway: Initiate Payment Process
PaymentGateway -> BackendAPI: Payment Page URL
BackendAPI -> SponsorshipsPage: Redirect to Payment
SponsorshipsStart -> AuthenticatedUser: Redirect to Payment Gateway

== Complete Payment ==
AuthenticatedUser -> PaymentGateway: Complete Payment
PaymentGateway -> AuthenticatedUser: Payment Confirmation
PaymentGateway -> BackendAPI: Notify Payment Success
BackendAPI -> DB: Update Sponsorship Status
DB -> BackendAPI: Confirmation
BackendAPI -> SponsorshipsPage: Update User Role to Sponsor
SponsorshipsPage -> AuthenticatedUser: Display Sponsor Confirmation

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. The authenticated user visits the sponsorships page.
2. The sponsorships page requests sponsorship levels from the backend API.
3. The backend fetches sponsorship options from the database and returns them to the sponsorships page.
4. The sponsorships page displays sponsorship options to the user.
5. The authenticated user selects the $350 sponsorship level.
6. The backend initiates the payment process with the payment gateway, which provides a URL for the payment page.
7. The user is redirected to the payment gateway to complete the payment.
8. Once payment is confirmed, the payment gateway notifies the backend.
9. The backend updates the sponsorship status and the userâ€™s role to sponsor in the database.
10. The user is shown a confirmation of their sponsor status.

This sequence diagram can be expanded or modified to include error handling, timeframes, or specific interactions with other website features as needed.

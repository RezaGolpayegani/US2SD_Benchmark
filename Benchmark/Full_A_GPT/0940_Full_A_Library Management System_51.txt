To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on the user story "As a librarian, I want to edit current books' shelf information," you need to illustrate how different parts of the system interact with each other during this process. Below is a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML language that outlines this interaction.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant WebInterface
participant AuthenticationServer
participant Database
participant BookManagementSystem

Librarian -> WebInterface : Access Book Management Section
WebInterface -> AuthenticationServer : Validate Librarian Credentials
note right of AuthenticationServer : Authentication is necessary\nto ensure only authorized\nusers edit book information.
Authenticationserver --> WebInterface : Verification Response

alt Successful Verification
    WebInterface --> Librarian : Display Edit Book Shelf Page
    Librarian -> WebInterface : Search for Book to Edit
    WebInterface -> Database : Fetch Book Details
    Database --> WebInterface : Book Details
    WebInterface --> Librarian : Show Book Details
    Librarian -> WebInterface : Enter New Shelf Information
    WebInterface -> BookManagementSystem : Update Shelf Information Request
    BookManagementSystem -> Database : Update Shelf Info in Record
    Database --> BookManagementSystem : Confirmation of Update
    BookManagementSystem --> WebInterface : Update Successful Message
    WebInterface --> Librarian : Display Success Notification

### Explanation:
- **Librarian**: This is the user initiating the sequence to edit a book's shelf information.
- **WebInterface**: Represents the frontend part of the CLMS where the librarian interacts.
- **AuthenticationServer**: This component is responsible for verifying the identity of the librarian to ensure that they are authorized to make changes.
- **Database**: The central system where all data related to books and their shelving information are stored.
- **BookManagementSystem**: A backend service responsible for handling operations related to managing books, which in this case includes updating book shelf information.

### Sequence Flow:
1. **Access and Verification**: The librarian accesses the book management section and is verified by the authentication server.
2. **Search and Select Book**: After passing the verification, the librarian searches for and selects the book they wish to edit shelf information for.
3. **Fetch and Display Book Details**: The system fetches and displays the details of the selected book.
4. **Edit Shelf Information**: The librarian enters new shelf information for the book.
5. **Update and Confirmation**: The updated information is processed and saved in the database, with a success message shown to the librarian.

This sequence assumes a successful authentication process. In case of failure, an error message is displayed. The illustrated interaction is a high-level overview, focusing on significant steps from the librarian's intention through system components interaction to the final goal.

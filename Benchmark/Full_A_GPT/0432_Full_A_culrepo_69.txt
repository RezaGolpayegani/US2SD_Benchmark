Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story you provided requires a sequence of interaction between the student, the digital repository system, and potentially other systems involved in the process like the DMP (Data Management Plan) compliance checker or NSF (National Science Foundation) systems. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines a potential interaction flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student
participant "Repository Interface" as Repo
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "DMP Compliance Checker" as DMP
participant "NSF System" as NSF

Student -> Repo : Accesses repository via secure login
activate Repo

Repo -> Student : Presents upload interface
activate Student

Student -> Repo : Submits dissertation data with embargo details
activate Repo

Repo -> CMS : Checks content format and requirements
activate CMS

CMS -> CMS : Validates content
CMS -> Repo : Confirms content is valid
deactivate CMS

Repo -> DMP : Verifies DMP requirements
activate DMP

DMP -> DMP : Matches data with DMP
DMP -> Repo : Confirms compliance
deallocate DMP

Repo -> CMS : Stores data with embargo settings
activate CMS

CMS -> Student : Sends confirmation & DMP compliance notice
activate Student
deactivate CMS

Student -> Repo : Requests submission to NSF DDIG
activate Repo

Repo -> NSF : Submits data and DMP compliance for DDIG
activate NSF

NSF -> NSF : Processes submission
NSF -> Repo : Confirms acceptance
deactivate NSF

Repo -> Student : Notifies success of NFS DDIG submission
deactivate Repo

This sequence diagram includes the following steps:

1. The student accesses the digital repository through a secure login.
2. The repository interface presents the upload interface to the student.
3. The student submits their dissertation data along with embargo details.
4. The content management system checks the content format and requirements.
5. The CMS validates the content and confirms that it's in a valid format.
6. The repository system verifies compliance with the DMP requirements.
7. The DMP compliance checker matches the submitted data against the DMP and confirms compliance.
8. The CMS stores the data with the specified embargo settings.
9. The student receives a confirmation message including a notice of DMP compliance.
10. At the student's request, the repository submits the data and DMP compliance information to the NSF DDIG.
11. The NSF system processes the submission and confirms acceptance.
12. Finally, the repository notifies the student of the successful NSF DDIG submission.

This sequence provides a generalized interaction flow based on the project description you provided. Depending on the specific requirements and existing systems at Cornell University, additional steps or systems might be involved in this process.

Generating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story, "As a manager, I want to see the remaining items," involves laying out the interactions between the system components that would enable a manager to query and receive the information on remaining items in inventory. 

Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines how this interaction might occur within the context of the Restaurant Management and Operations System:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Backend System" as BS
participant "Inventory Management Module" as IMM
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> MI: Request remaining items
MI -> BS: Fetch remaining inventory
BS -> IMM: Query remaining items
IMM -> DB: Select items with current stock levels
DB --> IMM: Return stock data
IMM --> BS: Return remaining items list
BS --> MI: Display remaining items
MI --> Manager: Show remaining items data

@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Sequence:**

1. **Manager**: Initiates the process by requesting to see the remaining items through the management interface of the system.
2. **Management Interface (MI)**: Receives the request and forwards it to the backend system to fetch the required inventory data.
3. **Backend System (BS)**: Upon receiving the request from the management interface, it asks the Inventory Management Module to query the remaining items.
4. **Inventory Management Module (IMM)**: This module interacts with the database to select the items and their current stock levels.
5. **Database (DB)**: Stores all data regarding inventory, including each item's current stock levels. It returns this information back to the IMM upon request.
6. **Inventory Management Module (IMM)**: After receiving the stock data from the database, it formats the data (if necessary) and sends it back to the Backend System.
7. **Backend System (BS)**: Receives the list of remaining items from the IMM and passes this information back to the Management Interface.
8. **Management Interface (MI)**: Displays the remaining items data to the manager, completing the request.

This sequence diagram assumes a seamless flow of information through modern software architectural components, focusing on the interaction required for the manager to visualize inventory levels. Remember, adjustments might be needed based on the specific implementation details of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

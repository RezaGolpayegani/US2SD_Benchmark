To fulfill your request for generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a researcher, I want to share reports I've written, so that it is available to staff and researchers" using PlantUML, below is a representation of how this interaction could be modeled. This sequence diagram outlines the processes involved from a researcher's perspective to share reports, including interactions with the system and how the system processes this action to make the reports available to staff and researchers.

Please note, this is a textual representation that should be converted to a visual sequence diagram using a PlantUML environment or any tool that supports PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "Upload Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
database "Digital Archive Database" as DB
participant "Access Control" as AC
participant "Notification Service" as NS

res -> UI : Navigate to Report Upload Page
UI -> Auth : Request Authentication
Auth --> res : Authenticate and Authorize
res -> UI : Upload Report
UI -> DB : Store Report Details\n(Set metadata, permissions)
activate DB
DB --> UI : Confirm Upload Success
deactivate DB
UI --> res : Display Upload Success Message

UI -> AC : Update Access Permissions
AC -> DB : Apply Access Rules
activate AC
AC --> UI : Permissions Updated
deactivate AC

UI -> NS : Trigger Notifications
NS -> DB : Retrieve Subscriber List
activate NS
DB --> NS : Provide Subscriber List
NS -> res : Send Confirmation Email
NS -> DB : Retrieve Staff and Researchers Emails
DB --> NS : Provide Emails
NS -> DB : Send Notifications to Staff and Researchers
DB --> NS : Notifications Sent

In this sequence diagram:

1. **Researcher Navigates**: The researcher navigates to the report upload page on the upload interface.
2. **Authentication**: Before uploading, the researcher is authenticated and authorized by the authentication system.
3. **Report Upload**: The researcher uploads the report, which then gets stored in the digital archive database with appropriate metadata and permissions.
4. **Confirmation**: The upload interface confirms the upload success back to the researcher.
5. **Access Control Update**: Access permissions for the report are updated, so it becomes available to staff and researchers.
6. **Notification Triggering**: The notification service is triggered to inform relevant parties (e.g., subscribers, staff, and researchers) about the new report.

This interaction overview encapsulates the essential steps involved from the perspective of uploading and sharing research reports within a digital archive system, following the specifications of the project description provided.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram based on the provided user story requires outlining the interactions between various system components and the server as the primary actor. The interaction to focus on is the server clocking in and out of their shifts and accessing their data. Given the technology stack and operational needs, the sequence diagram will incorporate entities like the User Interface (UI), Backend Server, Authentication Service, Employee Database, and possibly an Employee Schedule Manager for the sake of demonstrating employee scheduling and time tracking.

For the context of this solution, PlantUML code will represent these interactions. Here's an example:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ServerUI as "Server UI"
participant AuthService as "Authentication Service"
participant BackendServer as "Backend Server"
participant EmployeeDB as "Employee Database"
participant ScheduleManager as "Schedule Manager"

title Server Clock-In and Clock-Out Sequence

== Clock In ==
ServerUI -> AuthService: Authenticate(ServerID, Password)
AuthService -> ServerUI: AuthToken
note right: Authentication confirms server's identity

ServerUI -> BackendServer: ClockIn(AuthToken, ServerID, Timestamp)
activate BackendServer
BackendServer -> EmployeeDB: LogStartTime(ServerID, Timestamp)
activate EmployeeDB
EmployeeDB -> EmployeeDB: UpdateStatus(ServerID, "Clocked In")
deactivate EmployeeDB
BackendServer -> ScheduleManager: UpdateSchedule(ServerID, ClockInTime)
activate ScheduleManager
ScheduleManager -> ScheduleManager: ConfirmShiftStart(ServerID)
ScheduleManager -> BackendServer: ShiftStarted(ServerID)
deactivate ScheduleManager
BackendEndpoint -> ServerUI: ClockInConfirmed
deactivate BackendServer

== Clock Out ==
ServerUI -> BackendServer: ClockOut(AuthToken, ServerID, Timestamp)
activate BackendServer
BackendServer -> EmployeeDB: LogEndTime(ServerID, Timestamp)
activate EmployeeDB
EmployeeDB -> EmployeeDB: UpdateStatus(ServerID, "Clocked Out")
deactivate EmployeeDB
BackendServer -> ScheduleManager: UpdateSchedule(ServerID, ClockOutTime)
activate ScheduleManager
ScheduleManager -> ScheduleManager: ConfirmShiftEnd(ServerID)
ScheduleManager -> BackendServer: ShiftEnded(ServerID)
deactivate ScheduleManager
BackendServer -> ServerUI: ClockOutConfirmed
deactivate BackendServer

### Explanation:

1. **Authentication**: The server (employee) interacts with the user interface (Server UI) to authenticate themselves using the AuthService. This step is crucial to ensure the system's security and to verify the identity of the server before allowing access to sensitive operations such as clocking in and out.

2. **Clocking In**: Upon successful authentication, the server is allowed to clock in through the Backend Server, which logs the start time in the Employee Database and updates the server's status to "Clocked In". Additionally, the Backend Server communicates with the Schedule Manager to confirm the start of the shift.

3. **Clocking Out**: The process to clock out is similar to clocking in. The server initiates the clock out process through the Server UI, which then communicates with the Backend Server. The Backend Server logs the end time in the Employee Database, updates the status to "Clocked Out", and informs the Schedule Manager to confirm the end of the shift.

4. **Data Logging and Shift Management**: The Employee Database tracks clock-in and clock-out times alongside employee statuses, while the Schedule Manager ensures that shifts are accurately recorded to manage schedules effectively.

By illustrating these steps in a sequence diagram, stakeholders can visualize and understand the flow of interactions required for a server to clock in and out of the system. This visualization aids in identifying necessary system components and their relationships, facilitating a smoother implementation process.

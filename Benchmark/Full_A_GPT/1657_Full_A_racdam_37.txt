To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format, we will illustrate the interactions between a researcher and the digital archive management system, focusing on retrieving clear citation information for accurate publication citation.

The sequence will involve the following steps:
1. The researcher searches for a document.
2. The system displays the search results.
3. The researcher selects a document.
4. The system retrieves and displays the document along with its citation information.
5. The researcher copies or exports the citation information.

Below is a basic PlantUML script that outlines this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Document Management System" as DMS
participant "Citation Generator" as CG

Researcher -> Search: Enter search query
Search -> DMS: Retrieve matching documents
DMS -> Search: Return search results
Search -> Researcher: Display search results

Researcher -> DMS: Select document
DMS -> CG: Retrieve citation information for selected document
CG -> DMS: Citation information
DMS -> Researcher: Display document and citation information

Researcher -> DMS: Copy/Export citation information
note right of Researcher: Uses citation information for accurate publication citation.

This script visualizes the process from searching for a document to exporting citation information. This scenario assumes that the digital archive management system includes an automated citation generator (or equivalent functionality) that provides the citation information needed for publications. Each step represents a point of interaction between the researcher and the system components designed to fulfill the user story's need for clear and accessible citation information.

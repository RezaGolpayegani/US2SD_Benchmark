Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that encompasses a user story for having ALFRED on all computers, tablets, and phones involves outlining the interactions among different components such as the user, device interfaces, and the ALFRED system's backend services. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram example that demonstrates these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as user
participant "Device Interface \n(Computer/Tablet/Phone)" as device
participant "ALFRED Installation Service" as installService
participant "User Account Service" as accountService
participant "Device Synchronization Service" as syncService
database "ALFRED Database" as alfredDB

user -> device : Request ALFRED installation
device -> installService : Invoke installation
installService -> alfredDB : Check user account
alfredDB --> installService : Account details
installTimer -left-> accountService : Create/Verify account
accountService --> user : Account setup/confirmation
installTimer --> installService : Download ALFRED\nfor specific device
installService --> device : Install ALFRED
device --> user : Confirm installation

== Synchronization across devices ==
user -> device : Login to ALFRE
device -> accountService : Authenticate user
accountService --> user : Authentication success

user -> device : Request sync with other devices
device -> syncService : Initiate synchronization
syncService -> alfredDB : Fetch user's settings\nand preferences
alfredDB --> syncService : User settings\nand preferences
syncService --> device : Apply settings\nand preferences
device --> user : Synchronization complete

This sequence diagram starts with the older person (user) initiating the request to install ALFRED on their device (which could be a computer, tablet, or phone). The device then communicates with the ALFRED Installation Service to start the installation process. The Installation Service checks the user's account in the ALFRED Database and proceeds with the account setup or confirmation with the User Account Service. Once the account is set up, ALFRED is downloaded for the specific device type and installed.

After installation, the user logs in to ALFRED, and the device authenticates the user with the User Account Service. Then, the user requests synchronization across all their devices, which is managed by the Device Synchronization Service. This service fetches the user's settings and preferences from the ALFRED Database and applies them to the device, completing the synchronization process.

This diagram illustrates a high-level interaction flow and can be adapted or detailed further based on specific project requirements or system architecture aspects.

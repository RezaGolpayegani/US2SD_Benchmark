Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story you've provided, focusing on a library staff member creating metadata for items within the repository, involves several steps and participants within the system. Below is a representation of this process using PlantUML syntax. Note that this is a simplified version and actual implementations may require more details based on the project's specifications.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "LibraryStaff" as staff
participant "WebInterface" as web
database "DigitalRepository" as repo

staff -> web : LogIn()
activate web

web -> web : Authenticate()
web -> staff: ShowDashboard()

staff -> web : SelectCreateMetadata()
activate web

web -> staff: DisplayMetadataForm()

staff -> web : SubmitMetadataForm(title, description, author, documentType, status, fileLocations, subscribableFlag, subjectArea, releaseFrequency, keywords)
activate web

web -> repo : CreateMetadata(title, description, author, documentType, status, fileLocations, subscribableFlag, subjectArea, releaseFrequency, keywords)
activate repo

repo -> repo : ValidateMetadata()
repo -> repo : SaveMetadata()

repo --> web : MetadataCreatedSuccess()
deactivate repo

web --> staff : ConfirmMetadataCreation()
deactivate web

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the 'Library Staff' logging into the system through a 'Web Interface', then moving to select the option to create metadata for a new repository item. The 'Web Interface' displays a form for entering metadata details. After the library staff submits the completed form, the system validates and saves this metadata in the 'Digital Repository'. Finally, a confirmation of the metadata creation is sent back to the library staff.

Please adjust the granularity of the sequence diagram based on further details or specific functionalities of your project. This should serve as a foundational framework that highlights key steps in the process from the perspective of a library staff member uploading new metadata.

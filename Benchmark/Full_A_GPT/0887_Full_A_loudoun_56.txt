Below, you will find a PlantUML sequence diagram code that outlines the sequence of interactions between a staff member and the county's Property Information Portal system for the specific user story of creating condo units and associating them with a child parcel and address after the condominiums are recorded in the system.

Please note, this example assumes a basic flow and may be expanded based on the system's complexity, including error handling, authentication, and other necessary steps not explicitly mentioned but important for real-world applications.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as staff
participant "Portal Interface" as portal
participant "Database" as db

staff -> portal : Log in
portal -> db : Validate credentials
db -> portal : Authentication Response
portal <- staff : Select "Create Condo Unit"
portal -> staff : Display Condo Unit Form
staff -> portal : Submit Condo Unit Form(details)
portal -> db : Create Condo Unit Record
db -> portal : Condo Unit Creation Confirmation
portal -> staff : Display Success Message & Condo Unit Details
staff -> portal : Select "Associate with Child Parcel"
portal -> staff : Display Parcel Association Form
staff -> portal : Submit Parcel & Address Details
portal -> db : Update Condo Unit Record with Parcel & Address
db -> portal : Record Update Confirmation
portal -> staff : Display Success Message & Updated Condo Unit Details

This diagram starts with the staff member logging into the portal, proceeding through to creating a condo unit record, and ending with associating that condo unit with a child parcel and address. Each step in the process is delineated, showing interactions between the staff member, the portal interface, and the underlying database where records are created and updated.

For execution, make sure you have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor to visualize this sequence diagram. Remember, based on your specific project requirements or technical architecture, additional steps or alternative flows might be necessary for an accurate representation.

Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story involves visualizing the interactions between different system components and users (in this case, the cook) when editing product availability. Below is a PlantUML representation of such a sequence.

This diagram assumes the cook has already logged into the system and is in the process of updating the availability of a product (or dish). The process involves the cook, the system's UI, backend services, and the database where product data is stored.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook as cook
participant "UI" as ui
participant "Backend Service" as backend
participant "Database" as db

cook -> ui : Selects "Edit Product Availability"
ui -> backend : Request to fetch current product data
backend -> db : Query product availability
db -> backend : Return product data
backend -> ui : Display current availability
ui -> cook : Show current product availability

cook -> ui : Updates availability
ui -> backend : Submit updated availability
backend -> db : Update product availability in database
db -> backend : Confirm update success
backend -> ui : Confirm update to cook
ui -> cook : Show success message

### Explaining the Diagram:
1. **Cook Selects "Edit Product Availability"**: The cook starts the process by selecting the option to edit product availability through the system interface.
2. **UI Requests Current Product Data**: The system's user interface sends a request to the backend service to fetch the current availability status of the chosen product.
3. **Query Database**: The backend service queries the database for the current product data, including its availability status.
4. **Database Returns Product Data**: The database returns the requested data back to the backend service.
5. **Display Current Availability**: The backend service sends the current product availability data to the UI, which displays it to the cook.
6. **Cook Updates Availability**: The cook inputs the new availability status for the product.
7. **Submit Updated Availability**: The updated data is submitted from the UI to the backend service.
8. **Update Database**: The backend service updates the product's availability status in the database based on the cookâ€™s input.
9. **Confirm Update**: Once the update is successfully made, the database sends a confirmation to the backend service, which in turn confirms the update to the UI.
10. **Show Success Message**: The UI shows a message to the cook indicating that the product's availability status has been successfully updated.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in editing product availability within a Restaurant Management and Operations System.

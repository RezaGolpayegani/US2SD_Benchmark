Given the scope of your request, below is a simplified version of a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: _"As a data manager, I want to know which kind of data types will be produced or collected, so that I can ensure that the necessary technical resources and technical know-how is available."_

Please note that the complexity and specifics of a sequence diagram can vary widely based on the exact processes and integrations within your DMPTool project. The given example focuses on the data manager initiating a request to identify data types within a project and processing that information to assess technical resource requirements. Adjustments and expansions may be necessary to accurately depict the full details of interactions, especially in a complex system like DMPTool.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant DataManager as DM
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "Metadata Repository" as Metadata
participant "IT Resource Planner" as ITPlanner

DM -> Interface : request data type information for project
Interface -> Metadata : query for project data types
Metadata -> Interface : return data type details
Interface -> DM : display data type information
DM -> ITPlanner : assess technical requirements for data types
ITPlanner -> DM : provide technical resource requirements

@enduml
```

To use this PlantUML code:

1. You'll need to have PlantUML installed or access to an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy the provided code snippet.
3. Paste it into the PlantUML editor or your local setup to generate the sequence diagram.

This diagram illustrates the basic flow of interactions: the Data Manager requests information on data types within a project via the DMPTool's interface, which then queries a metadata repository. The repository provides details back to the interface, which are shown to the Data Manager. Based on this information, the Data Manager then engages with the IT Resource Planner to ensure the necessary technical resources and know-how are available to handle the identified data types.

Bear in mind, this sequence is simplified and might not cover all steps or entities involved in your specific project scenario. For instance, interactions with external metadata tools, the specifics of querying the metadata repository, and how IT resource assessments are made (which could include more detailed steps like assessing existing resources, identifying gaps, and planning acquisitions) would need more detailed flows and potentially more participants or systems in the diagram.

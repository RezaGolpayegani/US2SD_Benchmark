Creating a sequence diagram for the specified user story involves detailing the interactions between system components, the database/information retrieval (DB/IR) administrator, and the digital repository system for searching and tracking patron accounts. Below is a PlantUML code that outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DB/IR Administrator" as admin
participant "Repository Interface" as ui
participant "Search and Track Module" as stm
participant "Database" as db

== Search for Existing Patron Accounts ==
admin -> ui : Access search functionality
ui -> stm : Initiate search request
stm -> db : Query patron accounts
db -> stm : Return search results
stm -> ui : Display search results
ui -> admin : Show existing patron accounts

== Track Newly Created Patron Accounts ==
admin -> ui : Access tracking functionality
ui -> stm : Initiate tracking request
stm -> db : Query new patron accounts
db -> stm : Return new account data
stm -> ui : Display new accounts
ui -> admin : Show newly created accounts

### Explanation:

1. **DB/IR Administrator**: This is the user initiating the search and tracking requests.

2. **Repository Interface (ui)**: The front-end interface through which the DB/IR administrator interacts with the system. It serves as the entry point for submitting search and track requests.

3. **Search and Track Module (stm)**: A dedicated module or service within the digital repository system that handles searching and tracking of patron accounts. It processes the requests received from the repository interface.

4. **Database (db)**: This stores all information regarding patron accounts, both existing and newly created. It responds to queries from the search and track module with the relevant data.

### Sequence of Operations:

- **Searching for Existing Patron Accounts**:
  1. The DB/IR administrator accesses the repository interface and uses it to initiate a search for existing patron accounts.
  2. The search request is processed by the search and track module, which then queries the database for information on patron accounts.
  3. The database returns the relevant search results to the search and track module.
  4. The search and track module sends these results back to the repository interface.
  5. Finally, the repository interface displays these search results to the DB/IR administrator.

- **Tracking Newly Created Patron Accounts**:
  1. The process begins similarly with the DB/IR administrator accessing the tracking functionality through the repository interface.
  2. The tracking request is sent to the search and track module.
  3. The module then queries the database for newly created patron accounts.
  4. Upon retrieving this data, the database sends it back to the search and track module.
  5. The module processes and sends this information to be displayed on the repository interface, where the DB/IR administrator can review it.

This sequence diagram sketches out the high-level interactions without going into the specifics of the user interface or database schematic, focusing instead on the system's logical flow to fulfill the user story requirements.

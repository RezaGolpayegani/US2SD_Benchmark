For generating a sequence diagram based on the given project description for a librarian checking the number of books available for borrowing, we'll break down the steps into interactions among the system components. Please note, the sequence diagram represents a high-level flow and assumes familiarity with the basic syntax of PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as LMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Check Number of Books Available for Borrowing ==

Librarian -> LMS: Request available books count
activate LMS

LMS -> DB: Query available books
activate DB

DB --> LMS: Number of available books
deactivate DB

LMS --> Librarian: Display available books count
deactivate LMS

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the `Librarian` actor initiating a request to check the number of available books for borrowing. It involves interactions primarily between two system components: the `Library Management System` (LMS) acting as an intermediary and the `Database` that holds the actual data regarding books' availability statuses. Here are the high-level steps illustrated in the sequence diagram:

1. **Initiate Request:** The `Librarian` initiates the process by requesting the count of available books from the LMS.
2. **Query Database:** The LMS then queries the `Database` to retrieve the current number of books that are marked as available for borrowing.
3. **Return Data:** The `Database` responds with the number of available books to the LMS.
4. **Display Result:** Finally, the LMS communicates the count of available books back to the `Librarian`.

Remember, this diagram focuses on the basics of the interaction. Depending on the implementation details, additional steps like authentication checks, logging, or error handling might also be incorporated into the real sequence of operations. Furthermore, the backend might consist of more layers like a business logic layer, which was simplified here for clarity.

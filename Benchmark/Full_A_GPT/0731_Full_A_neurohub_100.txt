Given the request, I'll provide a high-level PlantUML representation of a sequence diagram for the user story: "As a researcher, I want to secure remote access to the Neurohub node when working away from the laboratory." This example focuses on a simplified workflow where a researcher authenticates and initiates a secure session to access the Neurohub node from a remote location.

Please note, specific implementation details will depend on the Neurohub architecture, and this diagram provides a conceptual overview rather than a detailed technical blueprint.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
boundary "Remote Access System" as RAS
boundary "Authentication Server" as Auth
entity "Neurohub Node" as Node

Researcher -> RAS: Request Access
RAS -> Auth: Authenticate User
Auth -> RAS: Authentication Success

activate RAS

RAS -> Node: Open Secure Session
Node --> RAS: Session Established

RAS --> Researcher: Access Granted
deactivate RAS

Researcher -> Node: Perform Operations
Node -> Researcher: Operation Results

Researcher -> Node: Terminate Session
Node --> Researcher: Confirm Termination

### Explanation:

1. **Researcher Requests Access:** The sequence begins with the researcher requesting access to the Neurohub node via a remote access system. This request can be made through a VPN, a web portal, or a secure shell (SSH), depending on the project's specific remote access setup.

2. **Authentication:** The remote access system then communicates with an authentication server to verify the identity of the researcher. This step is crucial for ensuring that only authorized users can access the Neurohub node remotely.

3. **Authentication Success:** Upon successful authentication, the authentication server notifies the remote access system that the researcher is authorized.

4. **Open Secure Session:** The remote access system initiates a secure session with the Neurohub node. This could involve establishing a VPN connection, starting a secure web session, or opening an SSH tunnel.

5. **Session Established:** The Neurohub node confirms that a secure session has been established, and the remote access system grants access to the researcher.

6. **Perform Operations:** The researcher is now able to perform their intended operations on the Neurohub node, such as accessing data, running analyses, or uploading new data sets.

7. **Terminate Session:** Once the researcher has completed their tasks, they request to terminate the session.

8. **Confirm Termination:** The Neurohub node confirms that the session has been terminated, completing the secure remote access process.

This sequence diagram represents a simplified overview of securing remote access to the Neurohub node. Depending on the specific technologies and protocols used (e.g., VPN, SSH), additional steps or components might be involved in the process.

Given the complexity of the scenario described in the project description, the following PlantUML sequence diagram represents the flow of actions a Director of Research Integrity might take to access reports detailing projects with sensitive or highly sensitive data and confirm the application of security protocols.

This sequence diagram assumes the existence of several system components as described in the project, such as the DMPTool system interface, a reporting module, a data classification system, a security protocols verification subsystem, and potentially other systems involved in handling sensitive data. Here is how the sequence might look in PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Director of Research Integrity" as director
participant "DMPTool Interface" as dmptool
participant "Reporting Module" as reportModule
participant "Data Classification System" as classificationSystem
participant "Security Protocols Verification" as securityVerification
participant "Sensitive Data Report" as report

director -> dmptool : Request to access specified reports
dmptool -> reportModule : Query for reports on sensitive data
reportModule -> classificationSystem : Request list of projects with sensitive \n or highly sensitive data
classificationSystem -> reportModule : Return list of projects
reportModule -> securityVerification : Verify security protocols for each project
securityVerification -> reportModule : Return verification results
reportModule -> report : Compile detailed report
report -> director : Display report

This diagram outlines the sequence of interactions starting from the Director of Research Integrity's request. The Director requests access to specific reports through the DMPTool interface. The tool then communicates with the Reporting Module to query for reports on projects that have been classified as containing sensitive or highly sensitive data. The Reporting Module requests and retrieves a list of such projects from the Data Classification System.

Subsequently, the Reporting Module checks with the Security Protocols Verification subsystem to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place for each project listed. The verification results are then used to compile a detailed report on the projects, with particular attention to their data sensitivity classifications and the security protocols applied.

Finally, the report is presented back to the Director of Research Integrity through the DMPTool interface. This sequence ensures that the Director can efficiently confirm that all research projects involving sensitive data adhere to the required security measures, fulfilling their role in oversight and compliance.

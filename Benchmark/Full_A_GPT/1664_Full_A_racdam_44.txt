To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story provided, we will outline the interactions between the researcher, the digital archive system, and the notification system when a researcher requests an item that is already digitized. This scenario assumes the system checks if items are digitized and notifies the researcher accordingly.

Below is the PlantUML code depicting this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as researcher
participant "Digital Archive System" as DAS
participant "Notification System" as NS

researcher -> DAS: Request item in reading room / for duplication
activate DAS
DAS -> DAS: Check if item is digitized
alt item is digitized
    DAS -> NS : Trigger notification to Researcher
    activate NS
    NS -> researcher: Send "Item Already Digitized" notification
    deactivate NS
else item not digitized
    DAS -> DAS: Proceed with request
end
deactivate DAS
@enduml
```

### How to Read the Sequence Diagram

1. **Researcher Requests Item**: The process begins with the researcher requesting an item in the reading room or for duplication.

2. **Digital Archive System Checks Digitization**: The Digital Archive System (DAS) checks if the requested item is already digitized.

3. **Notification Path**: If the item is digitized,
    - DAS triggers the Notification System (NS).
    - NS then sends a notification to the researcher informing them that the requested item is already digitized, thus advising them there's no need to proceed with the physical request.

4. **Alternative Path**: If the item is not digitized, the DAS simply proceeds with the request without involving the Notification System.

This sequence diagram aims to streamline the request process for researchers and improve efficiency by leveraging digitized resources when available.

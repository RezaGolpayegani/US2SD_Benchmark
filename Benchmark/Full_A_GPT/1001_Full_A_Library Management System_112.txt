Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a library employee, I want to see a member’s book reservation history" involves illustrating the flow of messages between objects within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to fulfill this request. The diagram will include objects such as the LibraryEmployee, UserInterface, BackendSystem, Database, and possibly others to depict the process.

Please note, the sequence diagram syntax for PlantUML begins with `@startuml` and ends with `@enduml`. Here’s a simplified version to depict the mentioned user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryEmployee as Employee
participant UserInterface as UI
participant BackendSystem as Backend
database Database

Employee -> UI : Selects Member's Profile
UI -> Backend : Request Reservation History(MemberID)
Backend -> Database : Query ReservationHistory WHERE MemberID
Database -> Backend : Return HistoryData
Backend -> UI : Display Reservation History
UI -> Employee : Show Reservation History

@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. **LibraryEmployee (Employee):** This represents the library employee who wants to access a member's book reservation history.
2. **UserInterface (UI):** The front-end interface through which the library employee interacts with the system. This could be a web page or an application.
3. **BackendSystem (Backend):** This logical component processes the request from the UI and communicates with the database to fetch the required information.
4. **Database:** The storage system where all reservation histories are kept. It responds to queries from the BackendSystem.

Step-by-step Flow:
- The library employee selects the member's profile through the User Interface (UI).
- The UI sends a request to the BackendSystem to fetch the member's book reservation history, identifying the member by their MemberID.
- The BackendSystem formulates a query to the Database to retrieve the reservation history specifically for the member in question, using their MemberID.
- The Database returns the reservation history data to the BackendSystem.
- The BackendSystem processes this data if necessary, and then sends it back to the UI.
- The UI presents the reservation history to the library employee, completing the request.

This simplified sequence diagram captures the essential interactions for the user story. Depending on the complexity of the Comprehensive Library Management System and specific requirements, additional steps or elements might be necessary, such as error handling, authentication, and authorization checks, or more detailed interactions with the backend systems and database queries.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story, “As a camp worker, I'm able to report a camper to the manager with inappropriate behavior,” involves representing the interactions between entities such as the Camp Worker, System (which might represent the Camp Management & Communication Platform), and the Manager. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram script to illustrate these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CampWorker as worker
entity "Camp Management\n& Communication Platform" as system
actor Manager as manager

worker -> system : Select "Report Behavior"
system -> system : Display Behavior Reporting Form
worker -> system : Fill out and Submit Form\n[Details of the Inappropriate Behavior]
system -> system : Log Report\n[Store in Database]
system -> manager : Notify of Behavior Report
manager -> system : View Report Details
system -> manager : Display Report\n[Camper Info & Behavior Details]
manager -> system : Acknowledge Report
system -> worker : Confirm Report Received by Manager
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Camp Worker initiates the process:** The sequence starts with the Camp Worker (CampWorker) selecting the option to report a camper's behavior through the system interface (e.g., choosing "Report Behavior").

2. **Behavior Reporting Form:** The system then presents a form for reporting the behavior, which the Camp Worker fills out with specific details about the incident and the camper involved.

3. **Submission and Logging:** Upon submitting the form, the system logs the report in the database for future reference and action.

4. **Notification to Manager:** Next, the system notifies a Manager of the reported behavior, ensuring that high-level staff are informed and can take appropriate actions.

5. **Manager Views the Report:** The Manager then requests to view the details of the report through the system, which responds by displaying all pertinent information, such as camper info and the behavior reported.

6. **Acknowledgment:** The Manager acknowledges the receipt and review of the report, which triggers the system to send a confirmation to the Camp Worker, closing the loop and ensuring the Camp Worker knows the report is being addressed.

This sequence diagram models the workflow and interaction between a camp worker, the camp management & communication platform, and a manager when reporting a camper's inappropriate behavior. It outlines the steps from reporting to acknowledgment, ensuring transparency and action on reported issues.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story involves illustrating the interactions between different system components and actors to realize the functionality of displaying overdue books to the librarian. Below is an example of a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: "As a librarian, I want to see books that are overdue so that I can warn library members."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as LMS
database BooksDB
participant "Notification\nService" as NS

Librarian -> LMS : request overdue books list
activate LMS
LMS -> BooksDB : query overdue books
activate BooksDB
BooksDB --> LMS : overdue books data
deactivate BooksDB
LMS --> Librarian : display overdue books
deactivate LMS
loop for each overdue book
    Librarian -> LMS : select book/member to warn
    activate LNS
    LMS -> NS : prepare warning notice
    activate NS
    NS -> NS : format email/SMS
    NS -> Librarian : send warning to member (email/SMS)
    deactivate NS
    Librarian --> LMS : confirmation of warning sent
    deactivate LNS
end
@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the following steps:
1. The librarian requests a list of overdue books from the Library Management System (LMS).
2. The LMS queries the Books Database (BooksDB) for books that are overdue.
3. The BooksDB returns the data of overdue books to the LMS.
4. The LMS displays the list of overdue books to the Librarian.
5. For each overdue book, the librarian decides to warn the associated library member.
6. The librarian instructs the LMS to send a warning.
7. The LMS communicates with the Notification Service (NS) to prepare the warning notice.
8. The Notification Service formats the warning notice into an email or SMS.
9. The Notification Service sends the warning to the library member.
10. The librarian receives a confirmation that the warning has been sent.

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions involved in the process of identifying overdue books and sending warnings to library members from the perspective of the librarian.

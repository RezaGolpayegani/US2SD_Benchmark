This sequence diagram illustrates the process a staff member would follow to perform a completeness review, ensuring that an application is complete and eligible for further technical review.

This diagram follows these steps:
1. **Staff Login and Application Selection**: The staff member logs into their account on the Customer Portal. They select from pending applications, for which the details are then fetched and displayed.
2. **Review Process**: The staff member reviews the application's details, including checking for the required documents and validating the information provided.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If all necessary information and documents are submitted, the application is marked as "Complete," updating the application's status in the database.
   - If there is missing or incomplete information, the application is marked as "Incomplete," and the database is updated accordingly. A request for additional information is generated, and the staff member communicates with the applicant for submission of the required details.

This sequence diagram adequately covers the steps a staff member would take to perform a completeness review on an application using the County Services & Property Information Portal.

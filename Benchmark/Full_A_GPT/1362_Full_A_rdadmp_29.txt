Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the project description and the user story you provided involves outlining the interactions between the metadata manager and the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) system, focusing on retrieving a short description of the project. Below is a simplified representation of how such a sequence might be designed. This example assumes a platform allowing users to query and retrieve project descriptions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Metadata Manager" as manager
participant "DMPTool Interface" as interface
participant "Metadata Service" as service
participant "Database" as db

manager -> interface : Request short project description
interface -> service : Fetch short project description
service -> db : Query project metadata
db -> service : Return metadata
service -> interface : Return short project description
interface -> manager : Display project description

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Metadata Manager (manager):** This participant initiates the process by requesting a short description of the project. This represents the user's action in the system - in this scenario, the metadata manager's role.

2. **DMPTool Interface (interface):** Acts as the intermediary between the metadata manager and the backend services. It receives the request for a short project description and forwards it for processing.

3. **Metadata Service (service):** This component is responsible for handling requests related to project metadata. Upon receiving a request from the interface, it queries the database for the necessary information.

4. **Database (db):** Stores all data related to research projects, including metadata. It processes the query from the metadata service and returns the relevant project metadata, which includes the short description sought by the metadata manager.

5. **Data Flow:** Arrows represent the direction of data flow, starting from the metadata manager's request to the final display of the project description.

This sequence diagram is simplified and designed to showcase the basic interactions for the specified user story. Depending on the complexity of the DMPTool and its architecture, there could be additional layers or services involved, such as authentication services, data validation, or logging services, which are not depicted in this high-level overview.

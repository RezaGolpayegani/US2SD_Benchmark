To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided, you'll need to outline the interactions between the assistant archivist, the digital archive management system, potentially other systems such as a database or a file storage system, and users like staff or researchers who will access the uploaded documents. Here's an example of how you can structure this in PlantUML language. 

Please note that to keep this example clear, some simplifications were made. Depending on the complexity of your actual system, you might need to add more details or steps.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Assistant Archivist" as AA
participant "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as DAMS
database "Archive Database" as DB
participant "File Storage" as FS
participant "Staff/Researchers" as SR

== Upload Process ==
AA -> DAMS : Select working papers
AA -> DAMS : Enter metadata and tags
loop For each document
   DAMS -> FS : Store working paper
   activate FS
      FS -> FS : Assign unique ID
      FS --> DAMS : Confirm storage and ID
   deactivate FS
   DAMS -> DB : Save metadata, tags, and ID
   activate DB
      DB --> DAMS : Confirm saved
   deactivate DB
end
DAMS --> AA : Confirm upload and tagging

== Access Process ==
SR -> DAMS : Search/Browse working papers
DAMS -> DB : Query metadata/tags
activate DB
   DB --> DAMS : Return results
deactivate DB
DAMS -> SR : Display search results
SR -> DAMS : Select working paper
DAMS -> FS : Retrieve document by ID
activate FS
   FS --> DAMS : Serve working paper
deactivate FS
DAMS --> SR : Display/Download working paper

This diagram represents the process as follows:

1. **Upload Process:**
   - The assistant archivist selects and provides the digital archive management system (DAMS) with working papers, along with their metadata and tags.
   - For each document, DAMS stores the file in a File Storage system, which assigns a unique ID to the document. The File Storage system confirms the storage and ID back to DAMS.
   - DAMs then save the metadata, tags, and unique ID in the Archive Database, which confirms that the information has been saved.

2. **Access Process:**
   - Staff or researchers search or browse for working papers through DAMS, which queries the Archive Database for metadata or tags.
   - The database returns the results to DAMS, which then displays the search results to the staff or researchers.
   - Upon selecting a working paper, DAMS retrieves the document from the File Storage by its unique ID and serves the paper to the requestor for viewing or downloading.

This sequence diagram outlines the basic flows for uploading and accessing staff-generated working papers in a digital archive, addressing the key elements of the user story. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific technical architecture and requirements of your project.

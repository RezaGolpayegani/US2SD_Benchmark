Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story of a manager wanting to see the number of reservations perbook on a year basis in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the user (Manager), the system components (like the front-end UI, the backend server, and the database), and any other entities involved in the process. Below is a PlantUML code snippet to represent these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> UI : Accesses Report Section
UI -> Backend : Request Yearly Reservation Stats
Backend -> DB : Query Number of Reservations per Book (Yearly)
DB -> Backend : Return Stats Data
Backend -> UI : Show Yearly Reservation Stats
UI -> Manager : Display Number of Reservations per Book (Yearly)

```

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Manager to UI Dashboard:** The interaction begins with the manager accessing the report section on the CLMS dashboard, indicating an intent to fetch reservation statistics.

2. **UI Dashboard to Backend Server:** Once the manager selects the specific report type (yearly reservations per book), this selection is communicated from the UI to the backend server as a request for yearly reservation statistics.

3. **Backend Server to Database:** The backend server processes this request and formulates a database query to fetch the number of reservations per book on a yearly basis.

4. **Database to Backend Server:** The database processes the query and returns the statistics data (the number of reservations each book has received within the year) back to the backend server.

5. **Backend Server to UI Dashboard:** With the data retrieved, the backend server then sends the statistics to the front-end UI to be displayed.

6. **UI Dashboard to Manager:** Finally, the UI dashboard processes this data into a readable format (such as tables or charts) and displays it to the manager, effectively providing them with the information they sought regarding booking reservations on a yearly basis.

This sequence diagram is simplified to focus on the main interactions and may not cover all error handling and security checks (like authentication and authorization checks) that a real implementation would require. Additionally, depending on the system architecture, there might be additional layers or services involved, such as caching systems or analytics services.

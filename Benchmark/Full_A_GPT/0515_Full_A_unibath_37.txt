To create a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story "As a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to approve scheduled disposal of data, so that data which is still required is not destroyed," follow the PlantUML syntax as detailed below:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Data Archive\nAdministrator" as admin
participant "Disposal\nScheduler" as scheduler
participant "Data Repository" as repository
participant "Notification\nSystem" as notification

admin -> scheduler : Review scheduled disposal list
scheduler -> repository : Fetch scheduled disposals
repository -> scheduler : Return disposals list
scheduler -> admin : Display disposals list
admin -> scheduler : Select disposals to approve
scheduler -> repository : Mark selected disposals as approved
repository -> scheduler : Update status
scheduler -> notification : Trigger approval notifications
notification -> admin : Confirm approval sent

### Explanation of Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Review scheduled disposal list**: The Data Archive Administrator initiates the process by reviewing the list of data scheduled for disposal.

2. **Fetch scheduled disposals**: The Disposal Scheduler queries the Data Repository to fetch the scheduled disposals.

3. **Return disposals list**: The Data Repository returns the list of scheduled disposals to the Disposal Scheduler.

4. **Display disposals list**: The Disposal Scheduler presents the list of disposals to the Data Archive Administrator for review.

5. **Select disposals to approve**: The Data Archive Administrator selects which data disposals to approve, ensuring that data still required is not marked for deletion.

6. **Mark selected disposals as approved**: The selected data disposals are marked as approved by the Disposal Scheduler in the Data Repository.

7. **Update status**: The Data Repository updates the status of the selected disposals to reflect their approved state.

8. **Trigger approval notifications**: The Disposal Scheduler triggers the Notification System to send out approval notifications.

9. **Confirm approval sent**: The Notification System confirms to the Data Archive Administrator that the approval notifications have been sent.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the Data Archive Administrator, Disposal Scheduler, Data Repository, and Notification System to ensure that data scheduled for disposal is accurately reviewed and approved, safeguarding against the destruction of valuable data.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story, "As a restaurant manager, I want to organize menu items depending on stored inventory to increase menu efficiency," involves several key components of the system interacting with each other. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines the sequence of interactions.

This PlantUML sequence diagram represents the steps a restaurant manager would take to organize menu items based on the current inventory to increase menu efficiency. Here's a breakdown of the process illustrated in the diagram:

1. **Manager Accesses Menu Management**: The restaurant manager accesses the Management Interface to manage the menu.
2. **Fetch Current Menu**: The Management Interface requests the current menu data from the database.
3. **Display Menu to Manager**: The Management Interface shows the current menu to the manager.
4. **Request Inventory Data**: The manager requests current inventory data to decide on menu adjustments.
5. **Query Inventory Levels**: The Management Interface requests inventory levels from the Inventory System.
6. **Inventory System Fetches Data**: The Inventory System retrieves inventory details from the database.
7. **Display Inventory to Manager**: The Management Interface shows current inventory levels to the manager.
8. **Manager Organizes Menu Based on Inventory**: The manager decides how to organize menu items based on the inventory data provided.
9. **Adjust Menu Items**: The Management Interface communicates the manager's decisions to adjust menu items to the Menu Management System.
10. **Menu Management System Updates Menu**: The Menu Management System updates the menu based on inventory levels in the database.
11. **Confirmation of Updated Menu**: The Menu Management System confirms the successful menu update to the Management Interface, which then informs the manager.

This diagram and process help ensure that menu offerings are always aligned with the restaurant's current inventory, thus increasing menu efficiency and reducing waste.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interaction between different parts of the system when an administrator assigns a room to a time slot and location to populate the schedule. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin as A
participant "Administration Interface" as AI
participant "Database" as DB

A -> AI: Login to administration portal
activate AI
AI --> A: Authentication successful

A -> AI: Navigate to 'Schedule Management'
activate AI

A -> AI: Select 'Assign Room'
activate AI
AI -> DB: Fetch available rooms and time slots
DB --> AI: Return available rooms and time slots

A -> AI: Select Room, Time Slot, and Location
AI -> DB: Update schedule with new assignment
DB --> AI: Confirmation of Update

AI --> A: Display success message
deactivate AI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the administrator logging into the administration interface and being authenticated successfully. Then, the administrator navigates to "Schedule Management" and selects the option to 'Assign Room'. The system fetches available rooms and time slots from the database and returns that data to the interface. The administrator then selects the desired room, time slot, and location for the event. The system updates the schedule with the new assignment in the database and confirms the update to the administration interface. Finally, a success message is displayed to the administrator.

This diagram assumes a basic flow and may need adjustments based on specific requirements or additional features of the system not described in the original project description.

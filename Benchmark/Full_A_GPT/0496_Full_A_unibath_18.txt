Given your request, here's a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML syntax to visualize the process outlined in the user story: "As a depositor, I want to attach subject-specific discoverability metadata to records, so that researchers in my discipline can find my data more easily."

Please note, this diagram assumes a high-level interaction sequence with the system components and actors involved in attaching subject-specific discoverability metadata to dataset records.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Metadata Service" as Meta
database "Data Archive" as Archive

Depositor -> Web : Navigate to dataset management
Web -> Depositor : Display dataset list

Depositor -> Web : Select dataset for metadata addition
Web -> Depositor : Present metadata form

Depositor -> Web : Input subject-specific metadata
Web -> Meta : Validate metadata format

Meta --> Web : Metadata validation result
alt Metadata is Valid
    Web -> Archive : Attach metadata to dataset
    Archive --> Web : Confirmation of metadata attachment
    Web -> Depositor : Display success message
else Metadata is Invalid
    Web -> Depositor : Display error message
    Depositor -> Web : Correct metadata input
    Web -> Meta : Re-validate metadata
    [-> Archive : Metadata attachment process repeats
end

### Explaining the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Depositor Interaction**: The depositor starts by navigating to the dataset management section through the web interface.
2. **Dataset Selection**: The web interface displays a list of datasets managed by the depositor, from which the depositor selects the specific dataset they want to add metadata to.
3. **Metadata Input**: The depositor is presented with a form to input the subject-specific discoverability metadata.
4. **Validation Process**: The inputted metadata is then validated by a metadata service component to ensure it meets certain format criteria.
5. **Conditional Flow**: 
   - If the metadata is valid, it's attached to the dataset record in the Data Archive with a confirmation sent back to the web interface and subsequently to the depositor.
   - If the metadata is invalid, an error message is displayed to the depositor prompting correction. The depositor corrects the input, and the validation process repeats until successful metadata attachment.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions and steps a depositor would take to attach subject-specific metadata to their dataset records within the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific implementation details and system architecture.

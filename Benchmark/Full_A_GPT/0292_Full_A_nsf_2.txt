Below is a detailed PlantUML code to illustrate the sequence diagram for the user story: "As a developer, I want to have the subdomain beta.nsf.gov be set up, so that I can deploy a beta site to it." This sequence outlines the steps from the request for subdomain setup to the deployment of the beta site.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "DNS Configuration" as DNS
participant "Cloud.gov Platform" as Cloud
participant "Web Infrastructure Team" as WebTeam
participant "Content Management System (CMS)" as CMS

Developer -> DNS : Request setup for beta.nsf.gov
activate DNS
DNS -> WebTeam : Verify subdomain setup requirements
activate WebTeam
WebTeam -> DNS : Confirm subdomain setup guidelines
DNS -> DNS : Configure beta.nsf.gov subdomain
DNS -> Developer : Confirm subdomain setup completion
deactivate DNS

Developer -> Cloud : Initiate beta site deployment
activate Cloud
Cloud -> WebTeam : Request deployment permissions for beta.nsf.gov
WebTeam -> Cloud : Grant deployment permissions
Cloud -> Developer : Provide deployment details and access
deactivate Cloud

Developer -> CMS : Prepare site content and features for deployment
activate CMS
CMS -> Developer : Provide content management capabilities
Developer -> Cloud : Deploy beta site to beta.nsf.gov
Cloud -> Cloud : Validate deployment and security settings
Cloud -> Developer : Confirm successful deployment

Developer -> WebTeam : Request final review of deployed beta site
WebTeam -> WebTeam : Conduct review and compliance check
WebTeam -> Developer : Provide approval and feedback

So, this diagram illustrates the following steps in the deployment process:

1. The developer requests the setup of the subdomain beta.nsf.gov.
2. The DNS Configuration system interacts with the Web Infrastructure Team to verify and then configure the subdomain.
3. The developer initiates the beta site deployment on the Cloud.gov Platform, which includes security and operation settings.
4. The Cloud.gov Platform liaises with the Web Infrastructure Team to ensure necessary permissions for deployment.
5. The developer prepares site content and features for deployment through the Content Management System (CMS).
6. The developer deploys the beta site to beta.nsf.gov utilizing Cloud.gov.
7. Finally, the developer requests a final review of the deployed beta site from the Web Infrastructure Team, which conducts a review and compliance check before providing approval.

This diagram is a high-level sequence of operations focusing on the developer's perspective in setting up and deploying a beta site to the newly configured subdomain.

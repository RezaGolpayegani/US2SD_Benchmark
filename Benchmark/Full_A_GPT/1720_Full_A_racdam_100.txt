The following is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, focusing on the user story: "As an administrator, I want to limit who can see certain metadata fields, so that I can show or hide things from display based on user groups." This scenario involves interactions among several components like the Administrator, the User Management System, Metadata Management, and the Database.

The sequence diagram describes the process in which an administrator configures the system to restrict visibility of specific metadata fields based on user group memberships. It assumes the use of a web-based interface for the administrative tasks and a backend system handling the metadata and user group configurations.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator
participant "Admin Interface" as AdminInterface
participant "User Management System" as UserManagement
participant "Metadata Management" as MetadataManagement
participant "Database" as DB

== Restrict Metadata Field Visibility ==
Administrator -> AdminInterface: Access Metadata Field Settings
AdminInterface -> MetadataManagement: Request Current Settings
MetadataManagement -> DB: Fetch Current Metadata Settings
DB -> MetadataManagement: Return Metadata Settings
MetadataManagement -> AdminInterface: Show Current Settings
AdminInterface -> Administrator: Display Current Metadata Settings

Administrator -> AdminInterface: Specify Field Visibility Restrictions
AdminInterface -> MetadataManagement: Update Visibility Settings
MetadataManagement -> DB: Validate User Group Exists
DB -> MetadataManagement: User Group Validation Response

alt If User Group Exists
    MetadataManagement -> DB: Update Field Visibility Based on User Group
    DB -> MetadataManagement: Confirmation of Update
    MetadataManagement -> AdminInterface: Display Update Success Message
    AdminInterface -> Administrator: Notify Update Success
else If User Group Does Not Exist
    MetadataManagement -> AdminInterface: Error Message (User Group Not Found)
    AdminInterface -> Administrator: Display Error Message
end

This sequence diagram illustrates the critical steps for an administrator to limit visibility of certain metadata fields based on user group permissions. Starting from the admin's decision to access and modify metadata field settings, the process includes validation of user group existence and the subsequent update of the metadata visibility settings in the database, culminating in a success or error message being displayed to the administrator depending on whether the specified user group exists or not.

To represent the user story "As a waiter, I want to see ingredients of order items" as a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, you will need to think about the steps involved in this process from the perspective of the waiter querying the system for ingredient information about a specific order item. The sequence might involve the waiter, the system's UI, the backend server, and the database where the menu items and their ingredients are stored.

Below is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram representing this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "UI\nRestaurant Management System" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Menu Database" as Database

Waiter -> UI : Select order item
UI -> Backend : Request ingredients of the selected item
Backend -> Database : Query ingredients of the item
Database --> Backend : Return ingredients information
Backend --> UI : Display ingredients information
UI --> Waiter : Show ingredients to the waiter

@enduml
```

This PlantUML code snippet illustrates a basic interaction flow where:
- The **Waiter** selects an order item for which he wants to see the ingredients.
- The **UI** (User Interface) of the Restaurant Management System takes this action and sends a request to the **Backend Server**.
- The **Backend Server** then queries the **Menu Database** to fetch the ingredients associated with the selected order item.
- The **Menu Database** returns the ingredients information to the Backend Server.
- The Backend Server sends this information back to the UI.
- Finally, the UI displays the ingredients of the order item to the Waiter.

Remember, the actual implementation details and the systems involved might vary depending on the specific requirements, and this illustration is based on a simplified version of the described process in your project description.

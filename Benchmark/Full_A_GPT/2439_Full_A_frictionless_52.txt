Creating a comprehensive sequence diagram to reflect the user story where a publisher wants to embed a preview button on their site for data preview involves outlining the interactions between various actors and systems provided by the DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer (DPIE) project. Below is a simplified PlantUML code representation of this process, focused on the key steps from embedding a preview button to displaying the data preview to the user.

Note: Since the original project description covers a broad range of integrations and functionalities, this sequence diagram will focus primarily on the components relevant to embedding a preview button and previewing data. This sequence does not cover all potential technical nuances and external service interactions in depth but gives an overview suitable for the DPIE scope.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant PublisherWebsite as PW "Publisher's Website"
participant DPIEEmbeddableComponent as DE "DPIE Embeddable\nComponent"
participant DPIEAPI as API "DPIE API"
participant DataPackageService as DPS "Data Package\nService"
participant UserBrowser as UB "User's Browser"

PW -> DE : Embed Preview Button
DE -> API : Request Data Package ID/URL
API -> DPS : Lookup Data Package
DPS --> API : Data Package Details
API --> DE : Generate Preview URL
PW -> UB : Display Preview Button

note over UB : User clicks Preview Button
UB -> DE : Request Preview
DE -> API : Fetch Preview Data
API -> DPS : Retrieve Data Package Preview
DPS --> API : Preview Content
API --> DE : Format Preview
DE --> UB : Display Data Preview

This diagram starts with the publisher embedding the DPIE Embeddable Component (which includes the preview button) onto their website. When a user interacts with this button, the sequence involves communication with the DPIE API to retrieve and format the data preview, ultimately displaying it to the user. 

Please adjust or extend the diagram based on detailed project specs or specific technical implementations used by DPIE, especially if more direct interactions with databases, file storage systems, or specific formatting requirements are involved.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story — "As a researcher, I want to request analog versions of digital objects, so that I can view them in the reading room" — you need to consider several actors and systems that would interact in the process. This includes the researcher, the digital archive management system (DAMS), the archivist, and possibly an inventory or repository system where information about the physical location of analog versions is stored. Below is a simplified example of how this could be represented in PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "DAMS Interface" as DAMS
participant "Archivist" as Archivist
database "Physical Inventory" as Inventory

Researcher -> DAMS : Search for Digital Object
DAMS -> Researcher : Display Search Results
Researcher -> DAMS : Select Digital Object for Request
DAMS -> Researcher : Show Request Form

Researcher -> DAMS : Submit Request with Details
DAMS -> Archivist : Notify of Analog Request

alt Exists in Physical Form
    Archivist -> Inventory : Check Availability
    Inventory -> Archivist : Confirm Availability
    Archivist -> DAMS : Update Request Status to 'Available'
    DAMS -> Researcher : Notify 'Request Approved'
else Not Available
    Archivist -> DAMS : Update Request Status to 'Not Available'
    DAMS -> Research' : Notify 'Request Denied'
end

Researcher -> DAMS : Acknowledge Notification
DAMS -> Archivist : Schedule Appointment for Researcher
Archivist -> Researcher : Confirm Appointment Details

This sequence diagram starts with a researcher searching for digital objects in the DAMS interface and ends with arranging an appointment to view the analog versions in the reading room. The process includes decision points, such as checking the availability of the analog version in the physical inventory.

Please note, this example assumes a basic workflow and may need adjustments to fit specific project requirements or technological capabilities. For instance, the interactions with the inventory database could be more complex, or there might be additional steps for user authentication and access permissions, which are not detailed in this diagram.

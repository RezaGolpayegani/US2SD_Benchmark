Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML requires a structured approach to illustrate the interactions between different system components and actors to achieve the user story's goal. Below is a PlantUML code representation of the sequence diagram for the described scenario where a camp administrator wants to delete campers from the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
database "Camp Database" as db

admin -> dashboard : Select Camper Records
dashboard -> db : Query Camper List
db -> dashboard : Display Camper List
admin -> dashboard : Choose "Delete" next to Camper's Name
dashboard -> db : Delete Camper Record
db -> dashboard : Confirm Deletion
dashboard -> admin : Show Confirmation Message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the camp administrator (Admin) interacting with the Admin Dashboard. The administrator selects the option to view camper records, prompting the dashboard to query the Camp Database for a list of campers. Once the database returns this information, the dashboard displays the list of campers to the administrator.

The administrator then chooses the "Delete" option next to the camper's name they wish to remove. This action triggers the dashboard to send a delete request for that specific camper record to the Camp Database. After the database has successfully deleted the record, it sends a confirmation of the deletion back to the dashboard.

Finally, the dashboard shows a confirmation message to the administrator, indicating that the camper has been successfully deleted from the database. This interaction concludes the process of keeping the pages free of clutter by removing unnecessary camper records as desired by the camp administrator.

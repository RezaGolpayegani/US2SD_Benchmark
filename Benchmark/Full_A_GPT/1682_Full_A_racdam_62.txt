Here is a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML format, which depicts the actions involved when an archivist wants to upload inventories to simplify the process for donor representatives to request their material. This diagram follows the steps that might be involved in the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project's system:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as A
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Upload Interface" as UI
participant "Database" as DB
participant "File Storage" as FS
participant "Notification System" as NS
database "Archival Collections" as AC

activate A
A -> Auth: Sign In
activate Auth
Auth --> A: Authentication Success
deactivate Auth

A -> UI: Access Upload Interface
activate UI

A -> UI: Choose Inventory File(s)
A -> UI: Provide Metadata
A -> UI: Define Access Rights
UI -> DB: Save Metadata & Access Rights
activate DB
DB --> UI: Confirmation
deactivate DB

A -> UI: Upload File(s)
UI -> FS: Store Files in Archive
activate FS
FS --> UI: Upload Success
deactivate FS

UI -> DB: Update Inventory List
activate DB
DB -> AC: Add New Entries
activate AC
AC --> DB: Update Successful
deactivate AC
DB --> UI: Inventory Updated
deactivate DB

UI --> A: Display Upload Success Message
deactivate UI

A -> NS: Send Notification to Donor Representatives
activate NS
NS -> A: Notification Sent
deactivate NS
deactivate A

Explanation:

1. **Archivist Authentication**: The process begins with the archivist signing into the authentication system to access the upload interface.

2. **Access Upload Interface**: Once authenticated, the archivist accesses the upload interface to start the process.

3. **Inventory File Upload**: The archivist chooses the inventory file(s), provides metadata, and defines the access rights for the files.

4. **Save Metadata & Rights, and Upload Files**: The system saves the metadata and access rights in the database and then stores the actual files in the file storage.

5. **Update Inventory List**: After successful upload, the system updates the inventory list in the archival collections database.

6. **Notification to Donor Representatives**: Finally, the archivist can send a notification to donor representatives about the new uploads, making them aware that new materials are available for request.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the steps involved from an archivist's perspective in uploading inventories to facilitate easier access for donor representatives. It covers the key touchpoints, including authentication, metadata entry, file storage, and notifications, while ensuring that each action is logically connected to enhance the understanding of the overall process.

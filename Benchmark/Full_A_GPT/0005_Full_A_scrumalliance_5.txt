Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you provided involves depicting the interaction and flow between different components involved in the process of a Trainer including additional details on their profile page.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing a sequence diagram for the specified user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Trainer as trainer
participant "Trainer Profile Page" as profilePage
participant "Profile Management System" as profileSystem
participant "Database" as db

== Trainer Updates Profile Details ==

trainer -> profilePage : Navigate to Edit Profile
profilePage -> trainer : Display Edit Profile Form

trainer -> profilePage : Input Additional Details
profilePage -> profileSystem : Submit Additional Details

activate profileSystem
profileSystem -> db : Update Trainer Profile
activate db
db --> profileSystem : Confirm Update
deactivate db

profileSystem --> profilePage : Display Update Success Message
deactivate profileSystem

profilePage --> trainer : Show Updated Profile

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the "Trainer" intending to update their profile with additional details. Here's a breakdown of the steps illustrated:

1. The "Trainer" navigates to their profile page and chooses to edit their profile.
2. The "Trainer Profile Page" displays an edit form to the "Trainer".
3. The "Trainer" fills in the additional details into the provided edit form.
4. The "Trainer Profile Page" submits these details to the "Profile Management System".
5. The "Profile Management System" processes the submission and updates the profile information in the "Database".
6. The "Database" confirms the update to the "Profile Management System".
7. The "Profile Management System" then signals the profile page to display a success message.
8. Finally, the "Trainer Profile Page" shows the updated profile to the "Trainer".

To visualize this sequence, you'll need to run this PlantUML code in a compatible viewer or editor. This serves as a simplistic model focusing on the crucial components involved in the process and can be further detailed based on the project's technicalities and specific requirements.

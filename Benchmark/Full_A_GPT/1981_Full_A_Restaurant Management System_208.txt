Creating a detailed sequence diagram requires specifying interactions between various components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System as they process a manager's request to see daily orders. We'll define the sequence from the manager initiating the request to receiving the data.

Below is a PlantUML format sequence diagram that outlines how the Restaurant Management and Operations System could handle the manager's use case.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant WebInterface as WI
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

M -> WI : Requests daily orders overview
activate WI

WI -> BS : Fetch daily orders
activate BS

BS -> DB : Query daily orders data
activate DB

DB --> BS : Return orders data
deactivate DB

BS --> WI : Daily orders data
deactivate BS

WI --> M : Display daily orders overview
deactivate WI

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Manager (M)**: Initiates the process by requesting an overview of daily orders through the Web Interface (possibly through a dashboard or a specific report page within the system).

2. **Web Interface (WI)**: Acts as the middleman between the manager and the backend server, receiving the request and forwarding it to the backend server to fetch the required data.

3. **Backend Server (BS)**: Handles the logic of fetching data by making a query to the database. It processes the request from the web interface, querying the Database for daily orders.

4. **Database (DB)**: Stores all the order information and processes queries from the backend server. It retrieves and returns the daily orders data based on the query.

5. **Data Flow Back to Manager**: The data flows back from the Database to the Backend Server, from the Backend Server to the Web Interface, and finally from the Web Interface to the Manager, where the daily orders overview is displayed.

This diagram is a simplified representation focusing on the main interactions for the manager's need to view daily orders. Depending on the complexity and specific implementation of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, additional steps or components (like authentication, logging, or error handling) might be involved.

To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story you provided, using PlantUML, we outline the essential steps that illustrate the process of a recycling facility (or representative) communicating directly with the site admin to convey issues or concerns. This description presumes the existence of a messaging or ticketing system within the RecycleSmart platform where facilities can report issues, which then are addressed by the platform admin.

This sequence diagram starts with the recycling facility accessing the issue report feature on the RecycleSmart platform and ends with the admin updating the issue status as resolved after necessary communication and actions taken. Intermediate steps include interactions with the platform's database for fetching and storing data related to the report, as well as direct communication between the facility and the admin. 

This flow assumes an authenticated session for both the facility representative and the admin, ensuring secure and authorized interactions within the platform. The optional steps represent potential back-and-forth communication for clarification or additional information as needed.

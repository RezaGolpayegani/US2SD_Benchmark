To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format based on the given user story, we will break down the process into key interactions between the Zooniverse admin, the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) system, any involved databases, and services that handle the classification and experience assessment of volunteers. The goal here is to model the process of how a Zooniverse admin might assess the weight of a volunteer's classification depending on their experience level.

Please note, the sequence diagram syntax for PlantUML is straightforward but does require understanding its basic structure and syntax rules. The following diagram is a conceptual representation and may require adjustments to fit into actual software architecture and specific implementation details.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ZooniverseAdmin as admin
participant "AMIDP System" as system
database "Volunteer Database" as volDB
participant "Experience Assessment Service" as expService
participant "Classification Weight Calculator" as calcService

admin -> system : request volunteer classification assessment
system -> volDB : fetch volunteer data
activate volDB
return volunteer data
deactivate volDB
system -> expService : assess volunteer experience(volunteer data)
activate expDto
expService -> volDB : retrieve historical classifications
return historical data
expService -> expService : calculate experience level(historical data)
return experience level
deactivate expService
system -> calcService : calculate classification weight(experience level)
calcService -> calcService : apply weight algorithm
return classification weight
system -> admin : return assessment result (classification weight)
deactivate system

This PlantUML sequence diagram describes the following process:
- The Zooniverse admin requests an assessment of the weight of a volunteer's classification from the AMIDP System.
- The system fetches the volunteer's data from the Volunteer Database.
- With the volunteer data, the system then requests the Experience Assessment Service to assess the volunteer's experience level.
- The Experience Assessment Service retrieves the volunteer's historical classification data from the database and calculates the experience level.
- Once the experience level is calculated, the system asks the Classification Weight Calculator to calculate the classification weight based on the volunteer's experience level.
- The Classification Weight Calculator uses a specific algorithm to determine the weight and returns this information to the system.
- Finally, the system returns the assessment result, which includes the classification weight, back to the Zooniverse admin. 

This diagram assumes a simplified process and focuses on showcasing interaction between components rather than detailing specific data structures or algorithms, which would require additional context and specifications.

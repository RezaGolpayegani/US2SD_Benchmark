Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story, "As a repository manager, I want to specify the remote replication policy for each collection," involves illustrating the interaction between the repository manager, the EDRMS system, and possibly external storage solutions or systems involved in the replication process.

Given the complexity and the abstract nature of sequence diagrams, the following PlantUML code represents a foundational approach to visualizing these interactions. This example assumes a simplistic process where the repository manager interacts with the EDRMS interface to set or update the replication policy which then gets enforced across specified collections, including interactions with remote storage.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as manager
participant "EDRMS Interface" as interface
participant "Replication Policy Module" as policyModule
participant "Collection Management" as collectionMgmt
database "EDRMS Database" as database
participant "Remote Storage Service" as remoteStorage

== Specify Remote Replication Policy for a Collection ==

manager -> interface : Access Replication Policy Settings
activate interface

interface -> policyModule : Retrieve Current Policy Settings
activate policyModule

policyModule -> database : Query Existing Policies
activate database

database -> policyModule : Return Policies
deactivate database

policyModule -> interface : Show Current Policies
deactivate policyModule

interface -> manager : Display Policies
deactivate interface

manager -> interface : Define/Update Policy for Collection
activate interface

interface -> policyPatch : Process Policy Specifications
activate policyPatch

policyPatch -> database : Update Policy in DB
activate database

database -> policyPatch : Confirm Update
deactivate database

policyPatch -> remoteStorage : Initiate Policy Replication Update
activate remoteStorage

remoteStorage -> policyPatch : Acknowledge Replication Policy Update
deactivate remoteStorage

policyPatch -> interface : Confirm Policy Update
deactivate policyPatch

interface -> manager : Show Update Confirmation
deactivate interface

### Explanation:
1. **Repository Manager Accesses Interface**: The sequence begins with the repository manager accessing the replication policy settings through the EDRMS interface.
2. **Retrieve Current Policy Settings**: The interface requests current policy settings from the Replication Policy Module, which queries the database and returns any existing policies.
3. **Define/Update Policy for Collection**: The repository manager defines or updates the replication policy for a specific collection using the interface.
4. **Process Policy Specifications**: These new or updated policy specifications are processed and then recorded in the database.
5. **Initiate Policy Replication Update at Remote Storage**: The new policy settings are sent to the remote storage service to initiate the update to replication policies.
6. **Confirmation**: The EDRMS interface provides the repository manager with a confirmation that the replication policy has been updated.

### Notes:
- Given the high-level nature of this user story, some assumptions were made about the interactions between components.
- The "Replication Policy Module" is a conceptual part of the EDRMS tasked with managing replication policies. Depending on the actual system architecture, this could be several services or modules.
- The "Remote Storage Service" acknowledges the update to ensure that replication policies are consistent across systems.
- Actual implementations can be more complex, depending on system requirements, the need for error handling, rollback mechanisms, and interactions with other system components not detailed here.

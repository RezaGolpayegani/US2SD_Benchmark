To execute your request, I'll first outline a simplified sequence of operations required to realize the user story, then represent this flow in PlantUML format. The actions should revolve around the Publisher using the CLI to issue a command that interacts with the platform's backend to restore the deleted data package. Let's detail the necessary steps and then convert it into a PlantUML diagram.

#### Simplified Sequence of Operations:
1. Publisher decides to restore a deleted data package.
2. Publisher opens the command-line interface (CLI).
3. Publisher runs a specific command to restore the deleted package, including the package's identifier or name.
4. CLI validates the command and asks for confirmation.
5. Publisher confirms the action.
6. CLI sends a request to the Platform's API to restore the deleted package.
7. The Platform’s backend system verifies the Publisher's identity and permissions.
8. The Platform’s backend system processes the request and restores the data package.
9. The Platform’s backend system sends a success response back to the CLI.
10. CLI displays a success message to the Publisher.

#### PlantUML Representation:
The following PlantUML code snippet represents the sequence diagram for the outlined operations. You can use this code in a PlantUML editor or integrator to generate the visual diagram.

```
@startuml
participant Publisher
participant CLI
participant PlatformAPI as "Platform API"
participant Backend

Publisher -> CLI: Run restore command with package ID
CLI -> CLI: Validate command
CLI -> Publisher: Request action confirmation
Publisher -> CLI: Confirm action
CLI -> PlatformAPI: Request to restore package
PlatformAPI -> Backend: Verify Publisher & permissions
Backend -> Backend: Restore data package
Backend -> PlatformAPI: Confirm restoration
PlatformAPI -> CLI: Success response
CLI -> Publisher: Display success message

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and doesn't delve into specifics like authentication processes or error handling, which would add complexity. For actual implementation, consider expanding the sequence to include these considerations.

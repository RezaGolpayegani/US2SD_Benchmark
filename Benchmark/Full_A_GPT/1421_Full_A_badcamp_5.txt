Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that demonstrates the process of a trainer editing their training node themselves. This includes authentication, accessing the edit form, making changes (including adding links to slides), and submitting the changes. 

This sequence assumes the trainer is already authenticated but walks through the important steps from the moment they decide to edit their training information to the system updating the records.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Trainer
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Trainer Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Training Edit Form" as EditForm
participant "Database" as DB

Trainer -> Auth: Access Platform
Auth -> Trainer: Authentication Success

Trainer -> Dashboard: Select My Trainings
Dashboard -> Trainer: Display List of Trainings

Trainer -> EditForm: Select Edit on Training Node
EditForm -> Trainer: Display Edit Form with Training Details

Trainer -> EditForm: Modify Training Information\nAdd Links to Slides
EditForm -> Trainer: Display Updated Information Preview

Trainer -> EditForm: Submit Updated Training Information
EditForm -> DB: Update Training Node Information
DB -> EditForm: Confirm Update
EditForm -> Trainer: Display Update Successful Message

This diagram breaks down the steps involved in a trainer editing their training node, which encompasses interactions with various components of the system, including the authentication system, the trainer's dashboard, the edit form for the training node, and the database where the training information is stored and updated.

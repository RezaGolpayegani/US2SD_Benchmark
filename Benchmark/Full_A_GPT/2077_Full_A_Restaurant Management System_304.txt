Given the scope of the project and focusing on the specific user story ("As a waiter, I want to see the orders"), hereâ€™s how you might express the interaction for viewing orders in a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax. This scenario will involve the waiter querying the system to view current orders.

Please note, to keep this example focused and relatively simple, it only covers the interaction from the waiter's perspective, engaging with the interface (UI), and the backend processes. You can expand this with more details based on the system's intricacies.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant ":UI/Waiter Interface" as UI
participant ":Order Management System" as OMS
participant ":Database" as DB

== View Orders Sequence ==

Waiter -> UI: Select "View Orders"
UI -> OMS: Request to View Orders
activate OMS

OMS -> DB: Query for Current Orders
activate DB
DB --> OMS: Return Orders
deactivate DB

OMS --> UI: Show Current Orders
deactivate OMS

UI --> Waiter: Display Orders
@enduml
```

Explanation of the diagram steps:
1. **Waiter -> UI**: The waiter interacts with the UI (possibly on a terminal or a mobile device) by selecting the option to "View Orders".
2. **UI -> OMS**: The Waiter Interface then sends a request to the Order Management System (OMS) to retrieve the current orders.
3. **OMS -> DB**: The OMS queries the database to get the current list of orders.
4. **DB -> OMS**: The database returns the list of current orders back to the OMS.
5. **OMS -> UI**: The OMS processes the orders, perhaps formatting them or filtering based on the waiter's needs, then sends this information back to the UI.
6. **UI -> Waiter**: Finally, the UI presents the orders to the waiter, completing the request.

This diagram can be expanded or modified based on additional requirements such as showing specific order details, filtering by table number, or integrating with real-time updates for order status changes. Remember, the details and components involved can vary based on the specific architecture and technologies used in your project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As an agency user, I want to map the FederalActionObligation properly to the Atom Feed" involves detailing the interactions between the agency user and the system components to achieve the desired outcome. Since this is a text format, please see below for a PlantUML representation of the sequence diagram. This assumes a process where the agency user interacts with the Broker Platform to ensure that the FederalActionObligation data is correctly mapped and transmitted to the Atom Feed.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AgencyUser as User
participant "Broker UI" as UI
participant "Validation Service" as Validation
participant "Mapping Engine" as Mapper
participant "Data Processing" as Processor
participant "Atom Feed Generator" as AtomGen
participant "Atom Feed" as AtomFeed

User -> UI: Navigate to Data Submission
UI -> Validation: Initiate Data Precheck
activate Validation
Validation -> Validation: Validate FederalActionObligation Format
Validation --> UI: Validation Results
deactivate Validation

alt If Validation Fails
    UI -> User: Show Error Messages
    User -> UI: Correct Data Format
    UI -> Validation: Re-validate Data
    Validation -> Validation: Validate FederalActionObligation Format
    Validation --> UI: Validation Passed
    deactivate Validation
end

UI -> User: Validation Success Confirmation
User -> UI: Confirm Submission
UI -> Mapper: Map User Data to Internal Schema
activate Mapper
Mapper -> Processor: Process & Map FederalActionObligation to Atom
deactivate Mapper

Processor -> AtomGen: Generate Atom Feed Entry
activate AtomGen
AtomGen -> AtomFeed: Update Atom Feed with New Data
deactivate AtomGen

AtomFeed -> User: Notify Feed Update

This diagram starts with the agency user navigating to the appropriate section for data submission within the Broker UI. It involves a pre-validation step to ensure the format of the FederalActionObligation meets the system's requirements. If the validation fails, the user is prompted to correct the data and resubmit. Once validation passes, the user confirms the submission, and the data goes through various system components like a mapping engine and data processor to ensure it is correctly formatted and mapped to the internal schema. Finally, the Atom Feed Generator updates the Atom Feed with the new data, and the agency user is notified of the feed update.

This sequence diagram specifies a simplistic view of the process tailored to the provided user story and does not include potential error handling or alternative flows for brevity. Moreover, actual implementations may involve more detailed interactions depending on the system's complexity.

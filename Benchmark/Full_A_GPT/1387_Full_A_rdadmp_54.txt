To create a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the given user story, we must highlight the steps involved when a researcher wants to know how long it will take to archive their data. This involves interaction between the researcher, the DMPTool, possibly an IT Manager or system for calculating archive times, and perhaps even a repository system for specifics on processing times. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "DMPTool" as dmptool
participant "IT Resource Planning Tool" as ittool
participant "Repository System" as repo

res -> dmptool : Request archival time estimate
dmptool -> ittool : Fetch IT resource availability
ittool -> dmptool : Return resource availability data
dmptool -> repo : Request average archival processing time
repo -> dmptool : Return average processing time
dmptool -> dmptool : Calculate total archival time
dmptool -> res : Display estimated archival time

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Researcher requests archival time estimate**: The process begins with the researcher initiating a request to the DMPTool to know how long it will take to archive their data.
2. **DMPTool fetches IT resource availability**: DMPTool communicates with the IT Resource Planning Tool to determine the current availability and capability of IT resources, which is crucial in estimating how quickly data can be moved to archives.
3. **IT Resource Planning Tool returns resource availability data**: The IT tool assesses and then supplies information about IT resource availability back to the DMPTool.
4. **DMPTool requests average archival processing time**: To obtain a more precise estimate, DMPTool queries the Repository System about the average time it takes to process and archive similar datasets.
5. **Repository System returns average processing time**: The repository system provides data on the typical processing duration for archiving tasks.
6. **DMPTool calculates total archival time**: Taking into account the available IT resources and the repository's average processing time, DMPTool computes the total estimated time required to archive the researcher's data.
7. **DMPTool displays the estimated archival time to the researcher**: Finally, DMPTool presents the researcher with an estimate of how long it will take to archive their data, enabling them to plan subsequent steps in their research project accordingly.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the researcher, the DMPTool, and other components necessary for estimating the time required for data archival, focusing on the process flow and the communication between different systems to meet the researcher's needs.

Given your request, let's create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML language focusing on the user story: “As a patron, I want to email the system provider to report issues and ask questions.” This example will assume that the system includes an accessible contact or support page where patrons can find the contact information or a direct email interface.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Patron
participant "Contact Page" as CP
participant "Email System" as ES
participant "Support Team" as ST

Patron -> CP: Access Contact Page
note right of Patron: Patron searches for\ncontact options
CP --> Patron: Display Contact Options\n(Email form/link)
Patron -> CP: Selects Email Option
note over Patron,CP: If a direct email interface is used:\n
Patron -> CP: Fill in and submit email form
CP -> ES: Forward Email Content
else If a mailto link is provided:
Patron -> ES: Open default email client
Patron -> ES: Compose and send email
end
ES -> ST: Deliver Email
note right of ST: Email is received by\nSystem Provider's Support Team
ST --> ES: Acknowledgment Email to Patron\n(optional, if automated)
ES -> Patron: Deliver Acknowledgment Email\n(optional, if automated)
ST -> Patron: Respond to Query/Report
note over ST, Patron: Response time may vary

This sequence starts with the patron accessing the contact page and ends with the support team responding to the patron's query or issue report. There are conditions reflected for whether the patron uses a direct email form provided on the contact page or a mailto link that opens their default email client. An optional step includes sending an automatic acknowledgment back to the patron, acknowledging receipt of their message, depending on how the system's email handling is configured.

This diagram demonstrates a straightforward interaction without going into the back-end processes of the email system or the detailed internal workflow of the support team, keeping the focus on the user's perspective and actions.

Given the specific user story focusing on an Extension Administrator seeking well-documented and easy-to-pass-on workflows, I'll create a sequence diagram showcasing the typical interactions such an administrator might have with the digital repository system. This will involve steps such as logging in, accessing and managing documentation, utilizing management tools, and perhaps passing on the information. Note that due to text format limitations, the narrative will guide you through creating the sequence diagram using Plant UML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Extension Administrator" as admin
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Repository Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Documentation Management" as docManage
participant "Workflow Management" as workflow
participant "Knowledge Transfer Tool" as transfer

== Authentication Process ==
admin -> auth: Enter credentials
auth -> auth: Validate User
auth --> admin: Authentication Success

== Accessing Management Tools ==
admin -> dashboard: Access Dashboard
dashboard --> admin: Display Options

== Managing Documentation ==
admin -> docManage: Select Manage Documentation
docManage -> docManage: Fetch Documentation
docManage --> admin: Display Documentation

== Editing Documentation ==
admin -> docManage: Edit/Add Documentation Details
docManage -> docManage: Update Documentation in System
docManage --> admin: Confirm Update

== Utilizing Workflow Management ==
admin -> workflow: Open Workflow Management
workflow -> workflow: Display Current Workflows
workflow --> admin: Edit/View Workflows

== Processing Knowledge Transfer ==
admin -> transfer: Initiate Knowledge Transfer
transfer -> transfer: Compile Documentation & Workflows
transfer -> transfer: Create Transferable Asset
transfer --> admin: Transfer Asset Ready

== Passing On Information ==
admin -> admin: Ensure Documentation is accessible
admin -> admin: Share Transferable Asset with Successors

This diagram outlines the flow of interactions for an Extension Administrator using the digital repository system to achieve well-documented and seamless workflows. The sequence starts with the authentication process, moving through accessing the dashboard, managing and editing documentation, utilizing workflow management tools, processing knowledge for a transfer, and finally passing on this information. The "Knowledge Transfer Tool" is conceptualized as a system feature that compulates necessary documentation and workflows into a format that can be easily transferred, ensuring that successors can maintain continuity effectively.

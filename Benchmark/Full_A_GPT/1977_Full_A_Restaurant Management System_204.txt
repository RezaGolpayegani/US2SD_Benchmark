Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the total tips so that I can distribute accordingly to the is employees" involves illustrating the interactions between the manager, the system's backend, and possibly other components necessary to fulfill this specific request. Since direct diagram generation in text format is challenging to visualize without actual diagramming tools, below is a conceptual representation in PlantUML language, which you can use with a PlantUML compiler or editor to generate the visual diagram.

```
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as interface
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Database" as db

manager -> interface : Request total tips information
interface -> backend : Query total tips

activate backend
backend -> db : Fetch total tips data
activate db
db --> backend : Tips data
deactivate db

backend -> backend : Calculate total tips
backend --> interface : Total tips information
interface --> manager : Show total tips information

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the manager requesting the total tips information through the management interface. The management interface then sends a query to the backend server to retrieve this information. The backend server interacts with the database to fetch the raw tips data (likely aggregated from the financial transactions stored in the database). After fetching the data, there might be some calculation or processing needed at the backend level to compile the total amount of tips received over a specified period. The backend server then sends this compiled information back through the management interface, which finally presents it to the manager.

Please note, depending on the specific implementation and requirements of your project, additional steps or interactions (such as authentication and authorization processes, error handling, or logging) might be necessary but have been omitted for clarity and brevity.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interaction between the user (OlderPerson), the ALFRED device, and possibly other system components entailed in detecting and informing the user about a low battery status when leaving the house. Here's a PlantUML code to visualize this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant ALFRED_Device
participant "Location_Sensor" as LocationSensor
participant Battery_Sensor
participant Notification_Service

== Leaving the House Scenario ==

OlderPerson -> ALFRED_Device : Wants to leave the house
ALFRED_Device -> LocationSensor : Check Location
LocationSensor -> ALFRED_Device : User is exiting the door
ALFRED_Device -> Battery_Sensor : Check Battery Status
Battery_Sensor -> ALFRED_Device : Battery is Low
ALFRED_Device -> Notification_Service : Trigger Low Battery Alert
Notification_Service -> ALFRED_Device : "Your device's battery is low"
ALFRED_Device -> OlderPerson : Show Low Battery Warning

This sequence diagram represents the process as follows:

1. **Leaving the House Scenario:** This initiates when the older person (user) wants to leave the house.
   
2. **ALFRED_Device to Location_Sensor:** ALFRED requests a location check from the in-built or connected location sensor to determine if the user is actually exiting the doorway.

3. **Location_Sensor to ALFRED_Device:** The location sensor confirms the user's action of leaving the house.

4. **ALFRED_Device to Battery_Sensor:** Subsequently, ALFRED queries the battery sensor to assess the current battery level of the device.

5. **Battery_Sensor to ALFRED_Device:** The battery sensor reports back that the battery level is low.

6. **ALFRED_Device to Notification_Service:** Given the low battery status, ALFRED then triggers a notification alert for the low battery status through its notification service component.

7. **Notification_Service to ALFRED_Device:** The notification service prepares and sends the actual low battery warning message to the ALFRE Device.

8. **ALFRED_Device to OlderPerson:** Finally, ALFRED displays or otherwise informs the user of the low battery warning, ensuring the user is aware before they leave the house.

This visualization helps stake out the interactions necessary for ensuring that the user is informed about the deviceâ€™s low battery status, taking advantage of ALFRED's integrated sensors and notification services. This sequence assumes that the ALFRED device is capable of sensing when the user plans to leave the house, directly or indirectly, through location or motion sensors.

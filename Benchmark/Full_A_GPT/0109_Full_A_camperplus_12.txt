Creating a detailed sequence diagram for your specified user story using PlantUML requires structuring the interactions between components such as the camp administrator, the camp management & communication platform, and possibly a database or storage system where rules for campers and camp workers are kept. Below is a textual representation of how this interaction might be captured in a PlantUML sequence diagram. 

To visualize it, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor, which can parse this text and generate the corresponding sequence diagram image.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant CampAdministrator as Admin
participant "Camp Management\n& Communication Platform" as Platform
database "Rules Database" as DB

== Create Rule ==
Admin -> Platform : Access Rules Management
activate Platform

Platform -> DB : Query existing rules
activate DB
DB --> Platform : Return existing rules
deactivate DB

Platform --> Admin : Show existing rules
Admin -> Platform : Submit new rule details
Platform -> DB : Save new rule
activate DB
DB --> Platform : Confirm rule saved
deactivate DB

Platform --> Admin : Confirm rule creation
deactivate Platform

== Modify Rule ==
Admin -> Platform : Access Rules Management
activate Platform

Platform -> DB : Query rule to modify
activate DB
DB --> Platform : Return rule details
deactivate DB

Platform --> Admin : Display rule details
Admin -> Platform : Submit modified rule details
Platform -> DB : Update rule in database
activate DB
DB --> Platform : Confirm rule updated
deactivate DB

Platform --> Admin : Confirm rule updated
deactivate Platform

Here's an explanation of the PlantUML diagram steps:

1. **Create Rule:**
   - The camp administrator accesses the rules management feature on the platform.
   - The platform queries the existing rules from the database to show the administrator what rules are already in place.
   - The administrator submits details of a new rule to the platform.
   - The platform saves the new rule to the database and confirms the action to the administrator.

2. **Modify Rule:**
   - The camp administrator accesses the rules management feature again, this time to modify an existing rule.
   - The platform queries the database for the details of the rule to be modified.
   - The administrator makes modifications to the rule through the platform interface.
   - The platform updates the rule in the database and confirms the update to the administrator.

Each step represents a message or an action, showing how components interact over time to accomplish the task outlined in your user story. This PlantUML diagram can be rendered into a visual sequence diagram using any PlantUML editor or integrator.

To generate a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the described user story, we will consider the main actions that an Extension Educator needs to perform to store documents, presentations, and datasets in a central archive/repository, and ensure that a list or directory of materials on their County/Region/Project site is automatically updated.

Below is a simplified version of how the sequence diagram could be structured, considering basic interactions with the system:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Extension Educator" as Educator
participant "Repository Interface" as Interface
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "County/Region/Project Site" as Site
participant "Repository System" as RepoSystem
participant "Site Directory Updater" as Updater

Educator -> Interface: Upload material (document, presentation, dataset)
Interface -> CMS: Validate upload & metadata
CMS -> RepoSystem: Store material
RepoSystem -> CMS: Confirm storage
CMS -> Updater: Trigger directory update
Updater -> Site: Update list/directory of materials
Site -> Updater: Confirmation
Updater -> Educator: Notify upload & directory update success

```

Explanation:

1. **Extension Educator (Actor):** Initiates the process by uploading material (documents, presentations, datasets) through the Repository Interface.

2. **Repository Interface:** The front-end interface through which the educator interacts with the system. It sends the upload request and associated metadata to the Content Management System.

3. **Content Management System (CMS):** Validates the uploaded material and metadata provided by the Extension Educator for consistency and compliance with repository standards.

4. **Repository System:** The backend system responsible for securely storing the uploaded materials. It sends a confirmation back to CMS once the material is successfully stored.

5. **Site Directory Updater:** A service or module that automatically updates the County/Region/Project site's list or directory of materials upon notification from the CMS. This ensures that the listing on the local site is synchronized with the central archive/repository.

6. **County/Region/Project Site:** Represents the dedicated site for the Educator's County, Region, or Project, which will display the updated list of available materials.

The sequence diagram uses simple interactions to represent the process. Depending on the project's complexity, further details such as error handling, user authentication, and specific metadata fields can be added to the sequence diagram for a more comprehensive representation.

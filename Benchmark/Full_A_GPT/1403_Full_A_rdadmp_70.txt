Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the given user story requires specifying the interactions between system components and the data manager. Given the complexity of the DMPTool, a simplified version of these interactions will be designed to focus on the core functionality related to understanding the security requirements of the data.

The sequence diagram will illustrate the following steps:
1. The data manager initiates a query to find out the security requirements for a dataset.
2. The system retrieves the dataset details.
3. The system checks the dataset's security classification and requirements.
4. The system presents the security requirements to the data manager.

Here is a basic PlantUML code snippet that models the interactions described:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager as "Data Manager"
participant DMPToolInterface as "DMPTool Interface"
participant DataManagerSubsystem as "Data Management Subsystem"
participant SecurityClassificationModule as "Security Classification Module"
database DataSetDetailsDB as "DataSet Details DB"

DataManager -> DMPToolInterface : Requests security requirements
DMPToolInterface -> DataManagerSubsystem : Retrieve dataset details
DataManagerSubsystem -> DataSetDetailsDB : Fetch dataset details
DataSetDetailsDB --> DataManagerSubsystem : Return dataset details
DataManagerSubsystem -> SecurityClassificationModule : Check security requirements

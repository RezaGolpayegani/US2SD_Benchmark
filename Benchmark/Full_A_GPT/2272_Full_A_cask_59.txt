Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story where a dataset creation fails if it cannot be enabled for exploration requires outlining the interactions between the user, the dataset management system, and possibly other components involved in the dataset lifecycle, including the exploration service. Here's a PlantUML representation of such a sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as user
participant "Dataset Management\nSystem" as DMS
participant "Dataset Type\nRegistry" as DTR
participant "Dataset Storage" as DS
participant "Exploration\nService" as ES
database "Dataset\nRepository" as DR

user -> DMS : Request dataset creation\nwith exploration enabled
DMS -> DTR : Verify dataset type supports\nexploration
alt Dataset type supports exploration
  DTR --> DMS : Dataset type verified
  DMS -> DS : Create dataset instance
  DS --> DMS : Dataset instance created
  DMS -> ES : Enable exploration on dataset
  alt Exploration enabled successfully
    ES --> DMS : Exploration enabled
    DMS -> DR : Save dataset details\n(with explore enabled flag)
    DR --> DMS : Dataset details saved
    DMS --> user : Dataset creation successful
  else Exploration enable failed
    ES --> DMS : Fail to enable exploration
    DMS -> DS : Rollback dataset creation
    DS --> DMS : Dataset creation rolled back
    DMS --> user : Dataset creation failed\ndue to exploration issues
  end
else Dataset type does not support exploration
  DTR --> DMS : Dataset type exploration unsupported
  DMS --> user : Dataset creation failed\nType doesn't support exploration
end

This sequence diagram starts with the user requesting the creation of a dataset with the exploration feature enabled. The dataset management system then checks if the dataset type supports exploration through the dataset type registry. If the type supports exploration, the system proceeds to create a dataset instance in the dataset storage. Upon successful creation, the system attempts to enable exploration on the dataset via the exploration service.

Two main conditional paths are considered:
- If enabling exploration is successful, the dataset details (including an "exploration enabled" flag) are saved in the dataset repository, and the user is informed of the successful creation.
- If enabling exploration fails, the dataset creation is rolled back, and the user is informed that the creation failed due to issues related to enabling exploration.

If the dataset type itself does not support exploration, the user is immediately informed that dataset creation has failed because the type doesn't support the required feature.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and might need adjustments based on the specific technical architecture and requirements of your system.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to read the delay books list, so that I can immediately return them" involves several steps such as the member initiating the request to view delayed books, the system querying the database, and then presenting the data to the user. Below is a basic example of how this sequence might be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant Member as member
participant "CLMS Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Library DB" as db

== Check Delayed Books List ==
member -> web : Access "My Account"
web -> backend : Request delayed books list for MemberID
backend -> db : Query delayed books for MemberID
db --> backend : Return delayed books list
backend --> web : Display delayed books info
web --> member : Show delayed books list

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the basic interaction between a library member, the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) web interface, the backend system, and the library database when the member wants to view a list of their delayed books. It starts with the member accessing their account section on the CLMS, the backend system requests the delayed books list from the database, and upon receiving the data, it's then presented to the member through the web interface.

Keep in mind, this is a simplified model. Real-world implementations might involve more complex interactions such as authentication and authorization checks, error handling mechanisms, and possibly integration with notification systems for sending reminders about the delayed books.

To illustrate the user story "As a data scientist, I want to be able to create a dataset instance of an existing dataset type without writing code" using a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, we will depict the interaction between the data scientist (user), UI or CLI, dataset management system, and dataset storage/repository. This sequence will cover the process from when the data scientist initiates the creation of the dataset instance until the instance is successfully created in the repository.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataScientist as DS
participant "UI/CLI" as UI
participant "Dataset Management\nSystem" as DMS
database "Dataset Repository" as Repo

DS -> UI : Request to create dataset instance
UI -> DMS : Parse request parameters\n(Select existing dataset type,\nDefine instance properties)
activate DMS
DMS -> DMS : Verify permissions\nand dataset type existence
alt dataset type exists and user has permissions
    DMS -> Repo : Create new dataset instance\nwith specified properties
    activate Repo
    Repo --> DMS : Instance creation confirmation
    deactivate Repo
    DMS --> UI : Display success message\nwith instance details
else dataset type not found or no permissions
    DMS --> UI : Display error message
end
UI --> DS : Show confirmation/error message
deactivate DMS

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Data Scientist Request**: The data scientist starts by requesting to create a dataset instance, specifying its type and properties, through the UI or CLI.

2. **UI/CLI Processes Request**: The UI or CLI forwards this request to the dataset management system, providing all necessary information.

3. **Verification**: The dataset management system verifies if the selected dataset type exists and if the data scientist has the necessary permissions to create an instance of this type.

4. **Instance Creation**:
    - If verification is successful, the system proceeds to create a new instance of the dataset in the repository with the specific properties defined by the data scientist.
    - Upon the successful creation of the instance, the dataset management system receives a confirmation from the repository.
    
5. **Success/Error Message**: Based on the outcome, the dataset management system responds back through the UI/CLI with either a success message detailing the dataset instance created or an error message if the process could not be completed (e.g., dataset type not found, or permission issues).

6. **Confirmation/Error to Data Scientist**: Finally, the UI/CLI displays this message to the data scientist, concluding the process.

This sequence diagram outlines a high-level interaction for creating a dataset instance without writing code, focusing on system interactions and user flow.

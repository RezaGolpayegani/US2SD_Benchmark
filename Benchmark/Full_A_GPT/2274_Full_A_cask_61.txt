Creating a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format requires specifying various components and the interactions between them for the scenario where a user wants to ensure that a dataset operation fails if it cannot make its required changes to explore. Given the complexity and scope of the Advanced Dataset Management and Version Control System project, the following is a simplified attempt to capture these interactions.

Please note that specific implementation details, such as the methods' names and parameters, are conceptual and may vary in your actual application development. This example assumes the existence of components like `UserInterface`, `DatasetManager`, `VersionControl`, and `ExplorationService` among others.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserInterface
participant DatasetManager
participant VersionControl
participant ExplorationService
participant Database

UserInterface -> DatasetManager : initiateOperation(datasetInfo)
activate DatasetManager

DatasetManager -> VersionControl : checkLatestVersion(datasetInfo)
activate VersionControl
VersionControl -> VersionControl : verifyVersionCompatibility()
VersionControl --> DatasetManager : versionDetails
deactivate VersionControl

DatasetManager -> ExplorationService : prepareExplorationChanges(versionDetails)
activate ExplorationService
ExplorationService -> ExplorationService : calculateChanges()
alt changes are valid
    ExplorationService -> Database : applyChanges(changes)
    activate Database
    Database --> ExplorationService : changeSuccess
    deactivate Database
   
    ExplorationService --> DatasetManager : explorationReady
else changes are not valid
    ExplorationService --> DatasetManager : failExploration
end
deactivate ExplorationService

alt exploration is ready
    DatasetManager -> UserInterface : operationSuccess
else exploration failed
    DatasetManager -> UserInterface : operationFail
    DatasetManager -> VersionControl : revertVersion(datasetInfo)
    activate VersionControl
    VersionControl -> Database : rollbackChanges()
    activate Database
    Database --> VersionControl : rollbackSuccess
    deactivate Database
    VersionCountrol --> DatasetManager : versionReverted
    deactivate VersionControl
end

deactivate DatasetManager
UserInterface -> User : displayResult
@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates the basic flow:

1. The `UserInterface` receives a request from the user to initiate a dataset operation.
2. The `DatasetManager` is called to handle the operation, which first checks with the `VersionControl` if the dataset is at its latest version and compatible.
3. With version details secured, the `DatasetManager` requests the `ExplorationService` to prepare and calculate the required exploration changes.
4. The `ExplorationService` determines whether the calculated changes are valid:
    - If valid, the changes are applied to the database, and the operation is marked as successful.
    - If not valid, the operation is prepared to fail, and necessary rollback procedures are initiated.
5. Based on the exploration result, the `DatasetManager` informs the `UserInterface` of the operation's outcome (success or failure).
6. If the operation fails, `VersionControl` is instructed to revert the dataset to its previous version by rolling back the changes in the database.
7. Finally, the `UserInterface` communicates the result back to the user.

Remember, this is a simplified representation. Real-world implementations may involve additional complexity, such as authentication and authorization checks, more granular error handling, event logging, notifications, and parallel processing for scalability.

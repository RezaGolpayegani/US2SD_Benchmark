Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story provided requires breaking down the interactions involved in preparing for and supporting the execution of a hearing from the perspective of a staff member involved in county services and property information management. Here is how you can express these interactions using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Staff Member" as Staff
participant "Hearing Management System" as HMS
participant "Application Database" as DB
participant "Applicant" as Applicant
participant "Notification System" as NS

== Pre-Hearing Preparation ==
Staff -> HMS : Log in to system
HMS -> DB : Retrieve upcoming hearings
DB -> HMS : Return hearings list
HMS -> Staff : Display hearings list
Staff -> HMS : Select specific hearing
HMS -> DB : Retrieve hearing details
DB -> HMS : Return hearing details
HMS -> Staff : Show hearing details

== Check Pre-Hearing Requirements ==
Staff -> HMS : Check pre-hearing requirements checklist
HMS -> DB : Retrieve checklist status
DB -> HMS : Return checklist status
HMS -> Staff : Show checklist and status

alt If all requirements not satisfied
    Staff -> HMS : Identify missing requirements
    HMS -> Applicant : Notify about missing requirements via NS
    Applicant -> NS : Acknowledge receipt
    NS -> HMS : Confirm acknowledgment
    Staff -> HMS : Log follow-up task
    HMS -> DB : Update task list
else If all requirements satisfied
    Staff -> HMS : Confirm readiness
    HMS -> DB : Update hearing status to 'Ready'
end

== Final Confirmation ==
Staff -> HMS : Send final confirmation to Applicant via NS
HMS -> NS : Generate confirmation notification
NS -> Applicant : Deliver confirmation notification
Applicant -> NS : Confirm attendance
NS -> HMS : Update attendance status
HMS -> Staff : Notify of Applicant's confirmation

== Hearing Execution Support ==
Staff -> HMS : Access hearing support materials
HMS -> DB : Retrieve materials
DB -> HMS : Return materials
HMS -> Staff : Provide materials

This diagram follows the steps a staff member might take in using a hearing management system (HMS) to prepare for and support the execution of a hearing. It includes interactions with an application database for retrieving and updating hearings and checklist information, an applicant to ensure they are informed and have met all pre-hearing requirements, and a notification system to manage communications effectively.

Note: This sequence diagram assumes a relatively straightforward process and may require additions or adjustments to accurately reflect the specific needs and systems of your project. For instance, interactions with external systems for document submission or more detailed steps for specific pre-hearing preparations could be added based on project requirements.

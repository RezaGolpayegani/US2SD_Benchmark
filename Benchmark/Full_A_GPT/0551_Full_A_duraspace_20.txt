To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a repository manager wants to indicate names related to an object, we'll define the actors, components, and processes involved in this specific function within the DIMS. The components might include the User Interface (UI), Back-End Services, Database, and potentially an Authentication Service if there's a need to verify the user's identity and permissions.

Given the specificity and technical nature of PlantUML, the following is a conceptual approach. Please note that to convert this into an actual Plant UML diagram, you will need to use an appropriate editor or a converter that understands PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as "Repository Manager"
participant UI as "DIMS User Interface"
participant Backend as "DIMS Backend Services"
participant Database as "DIMS Database"

Manager -> UI : Access Object Management
UI -> Backend : Request Object Details
Backend -> Database : Fetch Object Information
Database --> Backend : Object Information
Backend --> UI : Display Object Information
Manager -> UI : Indicate Related Names
UI -> Backend : Update Object with Related Names
Backend -> Database : Store Updated Names
Database --> Backend : Confirmation of Update
Backend --> UI : Update Confirmed
UI --> Manager : Display Confirmation Message

This sequence diagram outlines the steps a repository one would take to indicate names related to an object within the DIMS:

1. **Repository Manager (Actor)** initiates the process by accessing the object management functionality through the DIMS User Interface.
2. The **DIMS User Interface** requests existing object details from the **DIMS Backend Services**.
3. **DIMS Backend Services** fetches the object's information from the **DIMS Database**.
4. The database returns the object information to the backend services, which then provide it to the user interface.
5. The **Repository Manager** enters or modifies the related names for the object.
6. This update is sent back to the backend services, which then proceed to store the updated names in the database.
7. The **DIMS Database** confirms the update to the backend services.
8. The backend services confirm the successful update to the user interface.
9. The **DIMS User Interface** displays a confirmation message to the **Repository Manager**.

This diagram captures the high-level interaction and sequence of operations undertaken by a repository manager to indicate names related to an object in a digital asset management system, emphasizing information flow and process steps within the DIMS architecture.

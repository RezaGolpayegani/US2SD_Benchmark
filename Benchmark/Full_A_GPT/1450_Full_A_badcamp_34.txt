Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story requires a captured flow of interactions between the administrator and the system (in this case, the BADCamp Enhancement Platform) and potentially external systems or services (for instance, Drupal Planet's aggregator). Given your request, here's a simplified version of such a sequence diagram expressed in PlantUML syntax.

This diagram assumes the process involves an administrator logging into the platform, creating or editing a blog post, tagging it appropriately for Drupal Planet, and then the system handling the post in a way that ensures it's listed on Drupal Planet.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "BADCamp Platform" as platform
participant "Blog Module" as blog
participant "Drupal Planet Aggregator" as drupalPlanet

admin -> platform: Login
activate platform

platform -> admin: Authentication Successful
admin -> blog: Access Blog Post Form
activate blog

admin -> blog: Create/Edit Blog Post
admin -> blog: Tag for Drupal Planet
blog -> platform: Save Blog Post with Tag
platform -> drupalPlanet: Push Post to Drupal Planet
activate drupalPlanet

drupalPlanet -> platform: Confirm Receipt
platform -> admin: Display Confirmation Message

deactivate drupalPlanet
deactivate blog
deactivate platform
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Administrator logging into the BADCamp Enhancement Platform, moving to authoring or editing a blog post, tagging it specifically for Drupal Planet, and the platform then pushing this post to Drupal Planet. The confirmation flow ensures that the admin knows the process has been completed successfully.

Please note, the actual implementation details and interactions can be more complex, depending on the precise requirements, existing integrations, and how Drupal Planet aggregation works. This diagram serves as a conceptual framework and might need adjustments to fit the system architecture accurately.

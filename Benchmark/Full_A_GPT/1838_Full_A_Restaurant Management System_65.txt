To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a customer, I want to give comments about dishes," you'll want to illustrate the interactions between different system components from the perspective of a customer providing feedback. Below is an example of how this interaction may be modeled.

Since I can't draw diagrams directly here, I'll represent the PlantUML code needed to draw the sequence diagram. This code assumes a simple flow where a customer logs in, navigates to a dish they've ordered, and submits a comment on it. The system then records this feedback and updates the dish's feedback record.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

== Customer Gives Comment on a Dish ==
Customer -> UI : Selects "My Orders"
UI -> Backend : Request list of orders
Backend -> DB : Fetch customer orders
DB -> Backend : Return orders
Backend -> UI : Display orders
UI -> Customer : Show list of orders
Customer -> UI : Selects a dish from an order
UI -> Backend : Request dish details
Backend -> DB : Fetch dish details
DB -> Backend : Return dish details
Backend -> UI : Display dish details
UI -> Customer : Show dish details
Customer -> UI : Enter comment and submit
UI -> Backend : Post comment
Backend -> DB : Save comment to dish
DB -> Backend : Confirm save
Backend -> UI : Display success message
UI -> Customer : Show confirmation of comment submission

### Explained Steps:
1. **Customer Selection**: The customer accesses the "My Orders" section through the UI Interface.
2. **Fetching Orders**: The UI Interface requests a list of the customer's orders from the Backend System, which in turn fetches this information from the Database.
3. **Display Orders**: The orders are returned to the customer for selection.
4. **Selecting a Dish**: The customer selects a specific dish from their past orders to comment on.
5. **Dish Details Request**: The Backend System retrieves and displays the details of the selected dish for the customer.
6. **Entering Comments**: The customer enters their comment about the dish and submits it through the UI Interface.
7. **Comment Submission**: The comment is posted to the Backend System, which then saves the comment associated with the dish in the Database.
8. **Confirmation**: A success message is displayed to the customer, confirming the submission of their comment.

This is a simplified representation. Depending on the complexity of the system, several other steps and components (like authentication, error handling, notifications for the chef or management, etc.) could be involved.

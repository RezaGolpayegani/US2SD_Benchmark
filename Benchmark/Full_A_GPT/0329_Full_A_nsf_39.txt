To create a Sequence Diagram for the described User Story in PlantUML format, we need to depict the interactions between the User Researcher, the Outreach System, the Listserv, and possibly Feedback Mechanisms as well. This diagram will visualize the process of the User Researcher initiating an outreach to a list, receiving confirmation of a successful outreach, and then planning a new release to the next listserv on the priority list.

Below is the PlantUML code that represents this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserResearcher as UR
participant OutreachSystem as OS
participant Listserv as LS
participant FeedbackMechanism as FM

UR -> OS : InitiateOutreach(FirstList)
OS -> LS : SendEmail(FirstList)
LS -> OS : ConfirmReceipt
OS -> FM : LogSuccess(FirstList)
FM -> UR : NotifySuccess(FirstList)
UR -> UR : EvaluateSuccess
UR -> OS : InitiateOutreach(NextList)
OS -> LS : SendEmail(NextList)
LS -> OS : ConfirmReceipt
OS -> FM : LogSuccess(NextList)
FM -> UR : NotifySuccess(NextList)
UR -> UR : PlanRelease(NextList)

```

In this sequence:

1. **InitiateOutreach(FirstList)**: The User Researcher initiates an outreach to the first list, signaling the Outreach System to send an email to the first listserv.
2. **SendEmail(FirstList)**: The Outreach System sends an email to the first listserv.
3. **ConfirmReceipt**: The Listserv confirms the receipt of the email back to the Outreach System.
4. **LogSuccess(FirstList)**: The Outreach System logs this successful outreach with the Feedback Mechanism.
5. **NotifySuccess(FirstList)**: The Feedback Mechanism notifies the User Researcher of the success.
6. **EvaluateSuccess**: The User Researcher evaluates the success of the outreach.
7. **InitiateOutreach(NextList)**: Based on successful outreach to the first list, the User Researcher then initiates outreach to the next list on the priority list.
8. **SendEmail(NextList)**: The process repeats with the Outreach System sending an email to the next listserv.
9. **ConfirmReceipt** and **LogSuccess(NextList)**: The Listserv confirms receipt and the success is logged.
10. **NotifySuccess(NextList)**: The User Researcher is notified of the second successful outreach.
11. **PlanRelease(NextList)**: Finally, the User Researcher plans a new release to the next listserv based on the sequence of successful outreach attempts.

The sequence diagram described above provides a high-level overview of the interactions and processes that are involved when a User Researcher wishes to know when outreach efforts are successful, facilitating planning for further outreach and releases.

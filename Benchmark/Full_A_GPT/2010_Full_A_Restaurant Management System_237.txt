Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story: "As a restaurant employee, I want to see my monthly performance, so that I can request a bonus," entails illustrating the interactions between the restaurant employee and various system components. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions in a sequence diagram format. This diagram focuses on the flow from the employee's request through the system to retrieve the performance metrics and potentially request a bonus based on their monthly performance.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as emp
participant "Employee UI" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Performance Management Module" as perf
participant "Database" as db

emp -> ui: Request monthly performance
ui -> server: GetPerformance(employeeId, month, year)
server -> perf: FetchPerformanceMetrics(employeeId, month, year)
perf -> db: QueryPerformanceData(employeeId, month, year)
db -> perf: ReturnPerformanceData
perf -> server: Process and Evaluate Metrics
server -> ui: Display Performance Metrics
ui -> emp: Show Performance Results

alt Performance Meeting Bonus Criteria
    emp -> ui: Request Bonus Based on Performance
    ui -> server: RequestBonus(employeeId)
    server -> db: LogBonusRequest(employeeId)
    db -> server: ConfirmRequestLogged
    server -> ui: Display Bonus Request Status
    ui -> emp: Show Request Confirmation
else Performance Not Meeting Bonus Criteria
    emp -> ui: Display "Try harder next month!"
end

### How to Interpret the Diagram:

1. **Employee initiates a request**: The sequence starts with the restaurant employee requesting to see their monthly performance via the Employee UI interface.

2. **UI processes the request**: The Employee UI forwards this request to the Backend Server, asking for the performance data of the employee for the specified month and year.

3. **Server communicates with Performance Management Module**: The Backend Server passes the request to the Performance Management Module, which is responsible for fetching and processing performance metrics.

4. **Fetching data from the Database**: The Performance Management Module queries the Database for the performance data of the employee for the given period.

5. **Data processing and evaluation**: Once the Database returns the performance data, the Performance Management Module processes and evaluates these metrics to ascertain the employee's performance levels.

6. **Displaying the results**: The processed performance metrics are sent back to the Employee UI via the Backend Server, and the Employee UI then displays these results to the employee.

7. **Conditional Bonus Request Process**: Depending on whether the displayed performance meets the criteria for a bonus, the employee can either request a bonus through the UI or be prompted to improve their performance for the next evaluation period.

8. **Logging and confirmation of bonus request**: If a bonus request is made, the system logs this request in the Database and confirms the action was successful back to the employee through the UI.

This sequence diagram visualizes the flow of actions triggered by an employee's desire to view their monthly performance and, depending on the outcome, possibly request a bonus. It encapsulates interactions between the user interface, the backend logic, the performance management system, and the database within the context of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

== Use Case Initialization ==
PD -> DMS: Requests to use a custom dataset type
DMS -> DR: Searches for the requested dataset type
alt Dataset type deployed as part of an application
    DR -> AD: Confirms dataset type as part of app deployment
    AD -> CDT: Fetches dataset type details
else Dataset type deployed independently
    DR -> CDT: Fetches dataset type details independently
end

== Dataset Type Integration ==
CDT --> DMS: Returns dataset type details and metadata
DMS --> PD: Provides integration details for the plugin
PD -> PD: Integrates dataset type into plugin

== Finalization ==
PD -> DMS: Registers plugin with custom dataset integration
DMS -> DR: Updates dataset repository with the new plugin registration
PD -> DMS: Deploys plugin
DMS -> CDT: Confirms dataset type availability for the plugin

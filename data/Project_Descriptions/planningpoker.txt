As a moderator, I want to start a round by entering an item in a single multi-line text field, so that we can estimate it. I want all estimates to be shown immediately so that I can decide to show the estimates that have been given even though not all estimators have given their estimate. As an estimator,I want to see all items we try to estimate this session, so I can answer questions about the current story such as "does this include ___"

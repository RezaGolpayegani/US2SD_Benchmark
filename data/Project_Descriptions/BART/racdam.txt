As an archivist, I want to apply a license or rights statement, so that I know what I can do with a file. As a researcher I want structured citation data so I can cite a file easily later in a publication. I want a link to share a file on social media, so  I can show other people an interesting thing I found. As an researcher, want to download a file without having to come to the reading room to use it for research.

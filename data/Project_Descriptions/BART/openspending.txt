As a Data Publishing User, I want to be able to edit a dataset I have published. So that I can correct or enhance existing data. As a Platform Administrator, I Want to have a view on all datasets published by all users. So I can perform management actions on any dataset. As an API User I want maps that match the query made, so I can provide wider visualisations.

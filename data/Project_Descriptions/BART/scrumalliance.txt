As a site member, I want to describe myself on my own page in a semi-structured way, so that others can learn about me. As a trainer, I wants to list my upcoming classes in my profile and include a link to a detailed page about each, so prospective attendees can find my courses. As an editor, I Want to assign priority numbers to news items, so I can indicate which articles I want featured most prominently on the site.

This project involves the creation of a dynamic and robust repository management system, which caters to the needs of various users ranging from collection curators, repository managers and developers to faculty members, DigitalRecords Archivist, and depositors. The system will offer functionality for setting an expiration date for data, tracking financial responsibility for each item in the repository, producing reports on storage consumption, mapping items between collections, and setting search parameters based on dates. 

The system will potentially leverage Fedora 4 event audit services and will allow for the recording of events such as publication and unpublishing. The project involves implementing remote replication policies for collections, and provides tools for managing remote replication status and remote storage site encryptions. 

Users will be able to manage embargos on items, create deposit forms, maintain metadata visibility during embargos, and manage permissions post-release of embargos. Additionally, the project will include functionality for license management, batch ingestion of Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs), embargo metadata management, user authorization, and author authority control. 

The system will also include auditing, reporting tools, features for user management, scheduling messages for users, error display, and detailed dashboard statistics. The project strives to ensure uninterrupted access to the repository, provide a Linked Data interface, perform updates, and provide communication with Symplectic Elements. Other key functions include ensuring metadata changes are properly propagated to EZID, providing canonical identification for authors, and providing necessary feedback to depositors post-ingest. 

Finally, the system will cater to the needs of non-Duke researchers and faculty members, with features for comprehensive object description, detailed class management, and sophisticated permission and submission management.

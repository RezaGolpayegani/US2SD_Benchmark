The aim of the project is to create, maintain, and manage a user-friendly web interface for depositing and maintaining datasets in a university setting. The interface will offer familiarity to the users, provide a one-stop shop for managing research outputs. The project aims to facilitate the deposit of various sizes of files without the need for time-consuming version and format conversions. Crucial features like data embargo, application of licenses to protect IP rights, exclusive access options for collaborators, and linking datasets to publications are expected to be part of the interface. 

Furthermore, the interface should provide automatic metadata filling, link datasets with project DMPs, tracking of downloads and citations, assurance of data integrity, management of multiple versions, and the ability to delegate depositing tasks. These feature offerings will ensure compliance with funder requirements and further the impact of the users' work. 

The web interface will also have user-friendly features for those wishing to reuse data such as search options, various language options, preliminary assessment of data before downloading, and effortless citation processes.

The project also prioritizes the protection of external collaborators and coordinators' rights. The data archive administrators aim to maintain the quality of metadata and the system's data integrity with features like quality checks, minimum metadata requirement, approval of data disposal, and data query function.

As part of the project, integration with other university systems, promoting open standards for data deposit, and ensuring data storage compliance are also significant requirements. The interface facilitates transferability, archival plans validation for funders, and harvesting metadata on research outputs.

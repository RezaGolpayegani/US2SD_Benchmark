This project involves creating a comprehensive archiving system that allows archivists to manage and control the distribution, modification and viewing of archived files. The archivist should be able to apply licenses or rights statements to files, mark files or groups of files as restricted, set a date to remove restrictions from a file, and add detailed restrictions to groups of files. The system should also permit the archivist to restrict access to some files based on IP address and user, and have features such as auto-creation of access copies and technical metadata. 

For researchers, the system must facilitate generating citations, sharing links to files on social media, understanding copyright status, sharing reports and downloading files or reports for research purposes. The system should also provide a feature to request analog versions of digital objects and order copies of photos.

The system must have administrator controls to manage users, set access permissions, and facilitate password management. The system should also include features such as batch editing of metadata, uploading of single or multiple files, auto-generation of unique identifiers, and embedding of metadata in file headers. The system should allow users to browse and search all files, and make it easy to locate and retrieve files and documents. 

An additional feature requests for managing scans of archival material created for educational visits, loan documentation, and tracking use of a photo. The system needs to provide access to digital copies of unprocessed material and make them available for use, fulfilling the mission of the RAC. It should also integrate the RAC's collections into their web presence. The project aims to simplify, automate, and enhance the archiving process for all stakeholders, from the archivists and administrators to the researchers and donors.

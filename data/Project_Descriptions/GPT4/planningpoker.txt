This project involves building a web-based game for a team of moderators and estimators. The prime feature for this application is the ability for a moderator to create and manage rounds of estimation game. 

This includes creating a new game by specifying a game name and an optional description, inviting estimators to the game via a URL, initiating a round by entering an item to be estimated and managing items within a round that includes adding, editing, deleting, and selecting an item for estimation. 

The moderators are also able to show immediate estimates, accept the average of all estimates, have automatic estimate field filling, and re-estimate the stories from the current or previous sessions. The moderator also has the capability to manage their account, view transcripts of games, export the game data in various formats such as CSV and HMTL, control the game's scale, and invite up to 15 estimators.

Estimators are provided with multiple features like joining a game, viewing the item to be estimated, seeing all the items for estimation, and the ability to change their estimates until the final decision. 

Participants will have visibility over the estimates showcased and the contributors of each estimate. 

As a developer, the project includes ensuring accessibility, compliance with XHTML/ CSS standards, database efficiency, multilingual support, and seamless functionality across diverse browsers. 

For researchers, the project provides a mechanism to study non-identifiable data. Finally, there will be a feature for metrics visibility on the usage of the game.

This project description outlines the development of an online portal system meant to streamline county services and enhance the ease of access for the public. The system will allow public users to search for information relating to properties, services, processes among other crucial data. 

Prospective applicants will be able to research and select services, submit applications, inquire about pre-application assistance, submit supporting documentation, pay fees, check their transaction's status, and make alterations to their applications. Customers will be able to create and maintain a portal account that makes transactions easier.

The system will also be instrumental to the county's staff members in simplifying their tasks. Staff members will be able to review the completeness of applications, record internal notes, assign applications for review, apply or eliminate holds, send official responses to applicants, track draft proffers, manage approved proffers and ordinances, arrange meetings, and mark applications' statuses.

Moreover, planning staff will be enabled to carry out and monitor plan amendments and planning studies, generate reports, evaluate consistency with the comprehensive plan, conduct staff reviews, and process requests for zoning information. The system also provides features for county inspection staff to create, assign and conduct inspections, issue notices of violations and manage bonds through the lifecycle of a project.

All these features aim to expedite the working processes, enhance accuracy, increase efficiency, and elevate the level of service provided to the public by the county.

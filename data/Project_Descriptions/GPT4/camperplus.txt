This project is focused on the development of an integrated camp management system addressing the needs of the key stakeholders - camp administrators, parents, and camp workers. The system will allow camp administrators to effectively manage campers' records, schedule activities, track camper's forms, assign staff responsibilities, and monitor the usage of camp facilities. Functions will include creating, modifying and deleting camper records and tasks, as well as sending group messages to parents. 

The system will provide an avenue for parents to enroll their children in the camp, keep track of their children's activities, view assigned counselors, submit consent forms online, and message camp counselors. Parents can also manage their account details, make payments, and view photos. 

Camp workers and counselors will be able to view their assigned campers, report issues related to campers or the camp, and take attendance. 

Overall, the system will enhance efficiency, organization, and transparency at the camp, improve the delivery of services, lowers the amount of admin work, and foster a better experience for all concerned - administrators, parents, and camp workers.

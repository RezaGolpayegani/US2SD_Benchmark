This project aims to develop an extensive data management tool that puts emphasis on data packaging and integration. Developers, researchers, and publishers should be able to import data packages into different programming languages, such as Node, Julia, R, Python, C++, and Clojure for analysis and visualization in seconds. They should also be able to save, add type information, and provide visualizations of data.

The tool will facilitate data integrity, allowing users to analyze the validity of their data and understand any inconsistencies. Integrations with various platforms and data management systems such as Elasticsearch, SPSS, Eprints, MongoDB, DAT, DSpace, Feather, HDF5, and NetCDF will be established to enhance data maneuverability.

For improved comprehension and usage, the tool will enable the addition of general reference data, geographic data, and controlled vocabulary to datasets. A particular emphasis will also be placed on the integration with popular services like Microsoft Power BI, Zenodo, Open Refine, CKAN, Mendeley, and Excel. Additionally, there will be functions to import/export from MS-SQL and manage data in plaintext while still retaining its metadata.

User-friendly features like an interactive preview of data, customizable wizards, and usage statistics will be part of the user interface. The tool will also provide functionality for packaging reproducible steps to achieve certain data states, creating embeddable data summaries, generating basic dataset statistics, and making data availability checks post-publication. Lastly, the tool will provide features to specify funding sources and add DOIs to datasets. 

The project prioritizes transparency and collaboration, aiming to build a tool that allows users to confidently validate, share, and work with their respective data.

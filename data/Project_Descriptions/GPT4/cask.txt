The proposed project involves developing software that allows app developers to generate, test, deploy, and manage datasets as part of app development processes. Key capabilities to be included are the deployment of data sets as part of an app artifact, exploring dataset instances, control over data set creation and instance use during app deployment, and dataset sharing across multiple applications. For dataset developers, there will be options for deploying dataset types independent from applications, having dataset code injected at runtime, and properly packaging dataset types. They'll also be able to manage version control and deletion of outdated versions. 

For data scientists, the project will provide the ability to create and upgrade dataset instances with no coding requirement. For hydrator users, they'll be able to create pipelines that read and write dataset instances and explore datasets created by their pipelines. Finally, for plugin developers, the project will allow them to include dataset type code within plugin artifacts, use custom datasets and upgrade datasets used by a plugin when deploying a new version. 

The software will also provide additional tools such as the option to perform administrative operations on dataset instances and to configure time-to-live across all dataset types. Moreover, users will be allowed to specify schema as both a JSON and a SQL schema string, to update dataset properties and to decide whether a dataset is explorable. For application creation, the software will ensure that if any datasets cannot be created or reconfigured, the application creation fails, and communicates error messages effectively.

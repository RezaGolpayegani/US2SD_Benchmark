This project involves developing a comprehensive Data Management Plan (DMP) capable of capturing, storing and preserving all necessary metadata and data throughout a project's lifecycle. This robust DMP will also ensure data security, enabling it to adjust to changes in staff, regulations, processes, or technology. The plan will detail where data will be stored during its entire lifecycle to follow compliance and storage regulations. 

The project also implements a feature enabling the importation of previously captured metadata to avoid redundancies, ensuring efficiency in data management. This system will allow various stakeholders, including data managers, IT staff, researchers, even legal officers and institutional data stewards, to access relevant data parameters to maintain data integrity, secure resource acquisition, assess data sensitivity, and define security measures.

A mechanism for detailed information recording will also be developed for project owners, facilitating data submission, determining security standards, and calculating associated fees. As part of this system, stakeholders can reference this information as a guide for compliance to ethical standards, project proposal, and data rights necessary for managing the data.

The DMP will also allow for automated checks on essential parameters such as data types, file formats, and volume of data to ensure the accuracy of information and enhance the overall data management process. 

Finally, a mechanism for efficient data sharing, extraction of administrative information, data use compliance, and data reusability will be deployed to make sure that all critical components of the data lifecycle are properly accounted for. This project aims to make the data management process more efficient, safe, and reliable.

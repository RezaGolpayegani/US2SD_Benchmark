This project aims to enhance the functionality and usability of Neurohub, a cloud-based neuroscience data-sharing and analysis platform. This will involve developing custom scripts for the installation and testing of Neurohub on Ubuntu operating systems, and facilitating the migration of data from older versions of Neurohub to current iterations. The project will also focus on improving the user interface and experience to include features such as digitally recording responses on paper-based forms, securely navigating between log books and pages, and enabling customization of the website's theme. 

Additional enhancements include incorporation of a managed backup protocol for system administrators, custom file tagging and filtration, creation of logbook pages for conducting and documenting experiments, and access to files through a network drive. Furthermore, the project will develop a mechanism for electronically sharing papers and notes, managing worm strain stocks that are integrated with Wormbase, supporting long-term data curation, and providing a timeline display of multiple data files and their associated images.

The overall goal is to boost collaboration effectiveness by fostering easy accessibility and management of data files and logbooks, enabling controlled sharing of information, providing standardised metadata, improving searchability, and ensuring original data safety even when file locations are changed. 

It also aims to provide researchers with secure remote access to Neurohub for off-site working, facilitating electronic support in tracking data sets usage and modifications over different experiments, and offering a group-level repository for sharing papers, reviews, and comments. Lastly, details of workflow execution plans and history will be recorded in Neurohub to ensure transparency and traceability in shared research work.

This project involves the development of an online platform for a community of Certified Scrum Practitioners and Trainers. The platform will allow members to create and personalize their profile pages, apply for certifications, and share their experience and credentials. Trainers can list their upcoming courses and events, and members can search and connect with other members. 

Administrators will have the ability to approve or reject applications, edit member profiles and control the publishing of job ads and courses. Visitors can view news, articles, FAQs, and search for courses while trainers can post new courses, events, and manage their own listings.

Members will have privacy options, such as the ability to make profiles and email addresses private. Both admins and trainers will have the ability to update existing courses or events and delete those that are no longer relevant. 

The website will also have an advanced search option, RSS feeds for news and job listings, a FAQ section, and a section to download relevant resources. Additionally, the site will integrate job listings, provide reminder services for ad expiry, host a comment section and have an area for special announcements. 

Importantly, the platform will have a registry of all certified members and provide functionalities for trainers to add course participants into the Scrum Alliance records. The site will also facilitate corporate sponsorship, provide fee setting flexibility for administrators and offer a password recovery system.

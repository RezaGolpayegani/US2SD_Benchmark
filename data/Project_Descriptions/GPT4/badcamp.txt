This project entails the development of a comprehensive conference management system that accommodates the needs of various users - attendees, trainers, training coordinators, sponsors, administrators, and even anonymous visitors. The system will have functionalities that enable users to view lists of attendees, sponsors and user profiles. Training coordinators will be able to email trainers for updates, and view and track registration status for each attendee, among other things. 

There will be features that ensure trainers can edit their training details, developers can manage venues, users can edit their profiles and sponsorships can be managed effectively, among many other functionalities. Anonymous users will have the option to sign up for newsletters, view various lists and find out more about training options and sessions. 

This system is designed to increase efficiency, particularly for the training coordinators who can use it to track registration status and email all trainers at once. It enhances user experience by providing clear maps for attendees to find training locations, allowing users to add a training to their schedule and help attendees manage their event experience. Also, to enhance the registration process there will be features that limit one registration per day per authenticated user, and require attendees to accept cancellation terms.

The system will include various features to ensure effective management of sponsorships. It will also allow administrators to create and maintain venues, create blog posts, and tag their blog posts for consumption by Drupal Planet. The project will also cater to the needs of summit coordinators, allowing them to list basic information about their summit, list sponsors for their summit, and list an agenda for their summit. It will also enable users to view and post to the job board, look for Drupal gigs and assign a room to a time slot and location for scheduling purposes.

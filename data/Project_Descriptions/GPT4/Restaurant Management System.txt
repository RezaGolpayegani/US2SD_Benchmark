This project is aimed at developing a comprehensive restaurant management system software that will streamline operations for all stakeholders including cashiers, chefs, cooks, customers, management, servers, waiters, procurement managers, and restaurant owners. 

For cashiers, the software will facilitate financial operations logging, payment initiation, and order management. Chefs and cooks will benefit from features such as ingredient tracking, dish creation and updating, order processing and efficient communication with waiters. 

Customers will have the opportunity to view and update orders, comment on dishes, check allergy lists, make reservations, and view their past order history. This system will also cater to specific customer needs such as partial bill payments, ingredient removal and translation services.

Management will have the ability to generate comprehensive daily, weekly and monthly reports regarding orders, employee activity, and inventory, among others. They will also be provided with tools to manage and update menu items and employees' data, track sales and customer satisfaction, and manage inventory. 

Employees can also track their shift timings, update their contact information and handle customer orders. Other features for the software include creating a list of backup foods, keeping track of stock, applying discounts to customers, and reserving tables based on their availability. 

The projectâ€™s key objective is to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer dining experience through digitalisation of operations, efficient communication, and a systematic approach to inventory and menu management. Part of the project would also include creating a database to store inventory information and organize the menu items.

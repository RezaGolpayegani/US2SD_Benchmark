This project includes the creation and management of a digital repository for the Cornwall University faculty, patrons, administrators, library staff, and researchers. The repository will serve as a centralized location for uploading, accessing, and managing a myriad of resources like bibliographies, reports, datasets, research materials, dissertations, and other scholarly works.

For faculty members, the repository will allow them to receive attributions for their data and publications, direct students to specific items, manage how their work is presented, and maintain a single access point for all of their publications. They will also be able to view what reuse rights they have on files, upload data files, and create formatted citations for their work. 

For patrons, the repository will be designed to provide notification for new reports or datasets, a means to view and upload content in multiple formats, and the possibility to search and browse by author and subject area. 

Database and Information Repository (DB/IR) administrators will manage report/dataset name changes, manage classifications and customizable relationships, unpublish reports if necessary, and deal with potential errors. 

For library staff, the system will allow the application or removal of an access embargo to an item, creation of collections with enhanced metadata fields, deliver streaming media content, and provide detailed usage statistics and analytics.

For researchers, the repository will offer up-to-date research related to their field, an effective search mechanism within the repository, the ability to contact authors, and notifications for new work publications in their field or by specific authors.

Moreover, the project aims to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, promote work, fulfill fundersâ€™ Data Management Plan (DMP) requirements, and satisfy other user-specific needs making it accessible both onsite and remotely. The system will be robust to support a variety of media file and text-based formats. It will ensure redundancy of stored data for security and longevity, and the content will be preserved in a robust manner for stable, long-term access.

This project involves the creation and management of a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) specifically tailored for repository managers, DAMS managers, and repository users. The system includes features such as tracking, updating, and browsing all collections and objects within the DAMS, along with their relationships and custodial responsibilities. 

Repository managers can compose and describe collections, track and register changes to collections and objects, and manage components of a digital object including file associations and detailed categorisation. The manager also has the authority to limit access to these collections and assets to specific users, presumably those within a particular unit or of specific roles. 

Users of the DAMS can list all collections and objects that belong to specific library units, contact repositories, and browse collections within the DAMS. They have the ability to limit searches to specified collections, access content files, and be made aware of the rights status and repository ownership of an object. 

On the DAMS management side, the system caters to tracking repository ownership and collection associations of an object, monitors integrity of files, and presents information about copyright and licensing status of assets. 

This project also encompasses features such as search interfaces based on various entities like title, name, subject, geo-coordinates, and role. Information and notifications on copyright status, pertinent licenses and statutes as well as other rights are also introduced to the system. 

Finally, event tracking is incorporated into the DAMS, including the recording of events, identification of responsible agents, time of occurrence, and event outcomes. This comprehensive project aims to improve management, and user experiences within DAM management systems.

This project entails the development of a comprehensive media discovery and management system with a strong focus on user profiles and preferences. For users, the system aims to provide a music exploration platform that leverages content identification to reveal similar music and ringback tones, and uses enriched metadata to suggest related artists and genres. Users will also have the ability to find music and videos similar to other users with similar profiles, visually explore video segments via thumbnails, and get information about similar and perceptually similar video items. 

The system will also contain a robust recommendation engine delivering content suggestions based on relevant news events within users' areas. Users will also be able to identify people, products, and brands with the help of auxiliary elements such as geographic mapping and automatic speech recognition. 

For administrators, the system will offer advanced video management features including video segmentation, annotation, ranking, nudity and low-level asset-based content filtering. Administrators will be able to ensure copyright compliance through automated validation of ingested content. They will also have features for user behavior and interaction assessment, difficulty level determination, and volunteer type identification.

Part of the project will involve the Zooniverse, where admins will have the ability to analyze and classify images, detect certain elements within images, prefilter the images to remove artifacts, perform automatic motion analysis, detect moving and transient objects, group similar items, and recommend different projects to volunteers based on their past experiences. 

The system will also integrate features for administering informative and educational content to volunteers. Admins will determine when and how an interruption or education should be delivered to volunteers and what type of explanation Zoonibot should provide. The project also incorporates sound management features, including background noise and distracting sounds removal as well as whale call grouping for relevant audio files. 

In the end, an admin will be able to review a summarized version of articles for reuse purposes. This project combines the principles of user-centric design, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to offer a rewarding and context-aware media exploration experience for users, and an effective management and administrative tool for administrators.

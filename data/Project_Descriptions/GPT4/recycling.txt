This project is focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly website for locating and using recycling facilities. The website will feature an address link to Google Maps, showing the location of recycling centers. Users will be able to browse the website anonymously and enter their zip code to find nearby recycling facilities. This includes the facility operating hours, types of recyclable waste they accept and the option to add these to a favorites list.

The website will allow users to input their availability and preferred pick-up times. They can also receive notifications on new events by providing their email ID. Features include a map display of public recycling bins, special waste drop-off sites, and upcoming safe disposal events in their area.

Users can create a profile, check transaction history, and ensure that their personal information is securely stored. They can also provide feedback on invalid zip codes and receive rewards, encouraging continued use of the website.

Admin features include the ability to add or remove recycling facility information, read user feedback, block users based on IP, view a site status dashboard, and ensure all data is encrypted. They also have the capability to communicate directly with facilities and users.

The website will also cater to other stakeholders such as executives, HR departments, developers, and company accountants. It is intended to be accessible across all electronic devices, offering clients and users a seamless and pleasant experience navigating through the site. Facilities can update their information, and view user stats and schedules. Lastly, the project aims to provide an optimal route and schedule for drop-offs, promoting efficient waste management processes.

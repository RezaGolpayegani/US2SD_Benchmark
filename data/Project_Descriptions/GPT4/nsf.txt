This project involves developing the first iteration of a beta site for NSF on cloud.gov. Specific elements of the project include setting up a subdomain, determining the feasibility of a blog aggregator, switching the cloud.gov hosting plan from prototype to FISMA low, obtaining user research results, and creating social media wireframes. The project will also tackle the design direction of the beta site and the testing of the user research plan.

The project aims to simplify content editor's workflow, establishing clear CMS roles, and creating an acquisitions roadmap. By prioritizing workflow candidates, understanding the requirements for site authorization and planning the user research activities, the team aims to provide high-level strategy recommendations for the new CMS.

The project also seeks to determine visual design directions and develop prototype strategies. The team is expected to recruit for the last round of user research, schedule regular check-ins with stakeholders, and summarize workshop learnings. A key element is understanding brand guidelines and ultimately implementing them throughout the project.

Setting up a website recruitment test, creating visual design concepts for NSFâ€™s website, and ensuring that the correct people from NSF are invited to user interviews are also part of the project. This work aims to create a user-centered design approach for NSF that aligns with its brand and optimizes user experience. There is also an element of prototype testing and iteration based on user feedback.

The project requires ongoing collaboration with different professionals playing roles like users, content editors, team members, developers, stakeholders, designers, NSF employees, researchers, and more. Each have their unique needs and requirements which contribute to the overall outcome of the project. The aim is to create a beta site that can effectively serve the needs of NSF and its stakeholders, while also meeting the requirements for a robust content management system (CMS).

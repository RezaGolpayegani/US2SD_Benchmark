This project is meant to create a platform for Publishers to publish their datasets that they can either share privately or publicly, as well as import their data package into the registry for permanent online access. Publishers will be able to configure their client, update, unpublish, and delete a data package as required, and they will be able to validate their data prior to publishing. 

The platform will also allow the publisher to cache a copy of their data if their servers get lost or broken, so the data is always available to Consumers. Moreover, a Publisher will be provided an option to restore the deleted data package. The platform will enable a data package preview prior to publishing, for refining the dataset view. Publishers also have the ability to tag, version, and overwrite data packages while being warned not to overwrite stable tagged data.

From a Consumer's perspective, they want to view, download, and search for data packages efficiently. They also require detailed information about changes in the data package schema and notifications about changes in packages they are interested in. They want to view a publisher's profile to understand more about the publisher's packages and their activity level.

For Owners, the platform will provide the function to invite existing or new users via email to become a member of their publisher. Owners can also remove members and have control over roles within their organization. 

Finally, as an Admin, you can set key configuration parameters for the site. You'd also have metrics about usage and a sustainable billing system which could have different pricing plans for Publishers.

Therefore, this platform aims to serve as a comprehensive data package management system catering for Publishers, Consumers, Owners, and Administrators.

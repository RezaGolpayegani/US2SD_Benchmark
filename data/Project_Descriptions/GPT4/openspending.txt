This project aims to develop a fully-functional data management and visualization platform. The platform will offer features including the ability for a user to publish, edit, and delete datasets to correct errors, enhance existing data, and maintain the overall data cleanliness. The platform will provide support for various data import formats such as Excel, JSON, Google Spreadsheets, and Fiscal Data Package descriptor files. This will eliminate the need to convert data into a specific format for the data packager. 

It will also support the visualization and querying of data, including the ability to filter, sort, aggregate, and download data for use in other tools. For better understanding, the platform will allow users to change the display of monetary measures across different currencies and will accompany visualizations with textual descriptions. 

For accessibility, users will be able to share data views and download images of these views for offline use. Users will also have the ability to share these views on social media platforms. The platform will also consist of a data importing feature and integration with APIs, allowing users to have access to dynamic data from multiple datasets.

For the platform administrator, the platform will have the capability to control public/hidden status of datasets, perform management actions, and handle takedown requests or clean up test datasets. 

For API Users, the platform will support flexible querying, focusing on geographic context for mapping visualizations, normalization of measures by various socioeconomic indexes, and CSV output for cube-based queries. 

Moreover, it will allow customization of the platform's branding, enabling users to set their own usernames and set data visibility state. 

The aim is to make this platform a central hub for the open fiscal space featuring a blog to highlight projects and providing guidance for data visualization. This comprehensive platform will ultimately serve the needs of Data Publishing Users, Data Consuming Users, Platform Administrators, Developers, and API Users.

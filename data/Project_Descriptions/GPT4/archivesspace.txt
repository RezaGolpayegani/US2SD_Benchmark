This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive archival management application with a user-friendly interface and advanced functions. The application will enable a variety of user roles including researchers, application administrators, archivists, migration specialists, users, authenticated users, system administrators, repository managers, basic data entry users, read-only users and developers. 

The application will provide various functions such as viewing finding aids for collections, managing user credentials, importing and exporting data in different formats, assigning unique identifiers to components, data migration support, backend and frontend changes for managing enum lists, linking to contextual help, displaying read and edit views, assigning users to advanced data entry and configuring the help center URL and topic mappings.

Additionally, the application will also support adding properties for repositories and notes to other record types, creating new user accounts, adding administrative data and levels of description to resources, searching within a repository, rearranging resource and digital object hierarchies, creating and editing event and rights management records and managing digital objects.

The project will also include special configurations for developers, control over the location of the demo database and support for custom importers. It will ensure that users can authenticate locally and log in, create, update and delete records in repositories, view archival descriptions in repositories, and specify the source for a name form of an agent.

As a PI, I want to properly record all metadata, so that I can ensure proper running of the project in case of staff changes. As a researcher, I Want to indicate where my data will be stored during the project and where after the project, so it remains accessible during all stages of the data lifecycle. As an IT manager, Iwant to know about IT resource requirements early in the project lifecycle, so I can enable resource acquisition planning.

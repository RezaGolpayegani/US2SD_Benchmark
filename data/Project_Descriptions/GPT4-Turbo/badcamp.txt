### Project Title: BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform

### Project Description

The BADCamp Enhancement Platform is a comprehensive web project designed to significantly improve the experience of attendees, trainers, sponsors, and administrators involved in the Bay Area Drupal Camp (BADCamp). This multifaceted platform intends to streamline various processes, enhance user engagement, and simplify administrative tasks through a series of user-centric features and functionalities.

#### Features for Anonymous Users:
- **Training Module Exploration:** A dedicated page for each class with details including logo, title, trainers, location, datetime, skill level, registrations remaining, and registration links. All training options will be clearly marked for easy shopping and decision-making.
- **Sponsor Engagement:** Visibility into a list of sponsors and special sessions associated with sponsor attendees to recognize and engage with thought leaders and supporters of the event.
- **Event Navigation:** Access to venue details, event schedules, and a clear map of buildings and rooms to facilitate on-time arrival to sessions and trainings.
- **Community Engagement:** Options to sign up for the BADCamp newsletter, read blog posts, and find information on the coding lounge for networking and collaboration.

#### Features for Authenticated Users:
- **Personalized Experience:** Authenticated users can update their profiles, limit their registrations to avoid duplicates, add sessions to “my schedule”, and view their registered trainings for better event management.
- **Sponsorship Opportunities:** Enhanced sponsorship engagement features including the ability to pay for sponsorships directly through the website, link job postings to sponsorship profiles, and personalize sponsorship pages for brand promotion.

#### Features for Trainers and Training Coordinators:
- **Administrative Ease:** Email functionalities for trainers, editable training nodes, a comprehensive admin view for registration statuses, and the ability to track and manage registrations efficiently.
- **Training Management:** A view for trainers showing all attendee information and an admin view for coordinators to filter trainee information by session, ensuring trainers can focus on delivering value rather than administrative tasks.

#### Features for Summit Coordinators and Attendees:
- **Summit Coordination:** Ability for coordinators to list basic summit information, sponsors, and agendas to entice and inform potential attendees.
- **Summit Engagement:** Attendees can easily find detailed summit information, register for summits, check seat availability, and receive directions to venues, ensuring a seamless summit experience.

### Administrative Features:
- **Venue and Session Management:** Tools for administrators to create and maintain venues, assign rooms to time slots, and bulk approve sessions to populate the schedule efficiently.
- **Sponsorship and Refunds:** Capabilities to refund sponsorship money, assign sponsors to events, and manage individual sponsorship payments, ensuring flexible financial transactions.

### Objectives:
- **Enhance User Experience:** Ensure that every user, whether attending, training, sponsoring, or coordinating, has a seamless and informative experience from pre-registration to post-event activities.
- **Streamline Administrative Tasks:** Provide robust admin tools and views to streamline event management, from venue setup to session approval and user registration management.
- **Promote Engagement and Networking:** Foster an environment that promotes learning, networking, and community engagement through easy access to event information, sponsorship opportunities, and collaborative spaces.

This project aims to build a vibrant and interactive platform that supports the logistical needs of BADCamp while enhancing the overall community experience, thus ensuring BADCamp continues to be a leading event for Drupal enthusiasts.

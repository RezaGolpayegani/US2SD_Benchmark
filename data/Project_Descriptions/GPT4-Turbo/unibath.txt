### Project Description: Enhanced Research Data Management Platform

**Overview:**

The Enhanced Research Data Management Platform is a comprehensive solution aimed at improving how datasets are managed, shared, and reused within the academic community. This project seeks to address the needs of various stakeholders including depositors, data reusers, external collaborators, research facility managers, Bath Data Archive administrators, Research Information managers, UnivIT service teams, developers, academic publishers, and funding bodies. By streamlining the process of depositing, maintaining, managing, and accessing datasets, the platform will foster a more efficient and integrated research environment.

**Objectives:**

- To provide a simple and familiar web interface for depositors to submit and manage their datasets without the necessity of learning new software.
- To enable depositors to effortlessly deposit datasets, apply licenses, track citations and downloads, manage data versions, and attach metadata for enhanced discoverability.
- To support a seamless integration with current University systems (such as Pure and Opus), allowing for a unified management of research outputs and ensuring data integrity.
- To facilitate the depositing of large files, automatic metadata generation, the application of embargoes and disposal policies, and the minting of DOIs to enhance data citation and discovery.
- To offer data reusers easy access to the archive through web-based searches, including the ability to view dataset metadata, versions, and DOIs without language barriers, thereby maximizing the reuse of the University of Bath's data.
- To ensure privileged access for external collaborators and coordinators, safeguarding intellectual property rights and fostering effective collaboration.
- To empower research facility managers and Bath Data Archive administrators with tools for efficient data deposit, quality assurance, scheduled data disposal, and wholesale data import from external sources.
- To integrate the archive with existing university IT infrastructure and systems, promoting the use of open standards for data deposit and guaranteeing future data availability.
- To enable developers to interact with the archive via APIs and support academic publishers in creating persistent links between articles and underlying datasets.
- To provide funding bodies with the assurance that funded researchers have robust archival plans and to enable the harvesting of metadata for analysis of funding effectiveness.

**Key Features:**

- Simplified data deposit interface
- Integration with Virtual Research Environments and workflow tools
- Embargo and license management
- Privileged access for collaborators
- Support for arbitrarily large files
- Automatic metadata generation and reuse
- DOI minting and link to publications
- External repository linking
- Disposal policy specification
- Tracking of downloads and citations
- Data integrity guarantees
- Multi-language support for data reusers
- API access for developers
- Comprehensive reporting for administrators and research managers

**Outcome:**

The culmination of this project will result in a robust, user-friendly platform that not only simplifies the data management process for researchers and administrators but also enhances the visibility and impact of research outputs. By addressing the diverse needs of its stakeholders, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform will support the University of Bath's commitment to excellence in research and collaboration.

### Project Title: Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement

### Project Description:

The Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS) project aims to significantly enhance the functionality, user experience, and data integrity of an existing archival management system. Targeted primarily at archivists, system administrators, application administrators, migration specialists, and end users, this project encompasses a wide range of improvements and new features to streamline archival processes, improve data handling and increase system usability.

#### Key Features and Enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Finding Aid Accessibility**: Enable researchers to easily view finding aids for specific collections or resources, improving research efficiency.
  
2. **Administrative Functionalities**: Streamline administrative tasks by allowing application administrators to reset user passwords, assign users to advanced data entry roles, configure help center URLs, and manage permissions efficiently.

3. **Data Migration and Integrity**: Support seamless migration from AT or Archon to the enhanced system by storing source record IDs in each ASpace record. This facilitates data integrity testing post-migration.

4. **Improved Data Import and Export**: Provide capabilities for archivists to import EAD files, Accessions data in CSV format, Resources from MARCXML, and agent information from EAC-CPF records. Additionally, enable the export of agent records as EAC-CPF.

5. **Record Management and Editing**: Introduce functionalities for adding notes to record types, assigning unique identifiers to resource components, and editing Event records, Rights Management statements, and creating Collection Management subrecords.

6. **Hierarchical and Relationship Management**: Allow archivists to rearrange resource and digital object hierarchies using keyboard navigation or drag-and-drop functionality. Also, enable the association of instances with resources or resource components and specify relationships between agents and accessions or resources.

7. **User Access and Authentication**: Enhance user access controls by implementing LDAP authentication and local login options. Also, provide users with links to contextual help to aid in system navigation and usage.

8. **Frontend and Backend Improvements**: Implement both frontend and backend changes to manage ENUM lists, support bulk updating of ENUM values, and load ENUM value lists from the database.

9. **Repository and Record Management**: Empower repository managers with capabilities to create, update, and delete archival descriptions and any records in the repository. Additionally, facilitate the creation and management of user accounts and roles, including readonly access.

10. **Customization and Usability Enhancements**: Enable developers and system administrators to use configurations not prepackaged within a built version of the application, control the location of the demo database, and prevent inadvertent overwrites to records by multiple editors.

### Objectives:
- Streamline archival data import/export processes and improve data management capabilities.
- Enhance user experience through improved system usability, access control, and customized support.
- Support data migration integrity and facilitate seamless transition from legacy systems.

### Target Audience:
- Archivists
- Application and System Administrators
- Migration Specialists
- Repository Managers
- End Users (Researchers and General Users)

### Expected Outcomes:
- A robust, user-friendly archival management system that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of archival processes.
- Improved system accessibility and user authentication mechanisms.
- Enhanced data integrity and seamless migration capabilities from legacy systems.

This project is poised to revolutionize the way archival data is managed, accessed, and preserved, ensuring that users across different roles can perform their tasks more efficiently and effectively.

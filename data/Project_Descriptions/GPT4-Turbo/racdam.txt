**Project Title: Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project**

**Project Description:**

The Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project is designed to significantly improve the management, access, and use of digital archival collections for archivists, assistant archivists, donor representatives, and researchers. This comprehensive initiative seeks to address a range of critical functionalities needed to efficiently handle digital files within archival settings, ensuring proper licensing, restricted access, ease of use, and enhanced user experiences for various stakeholders.

**Key Features:**

1. **Licensing and Rights Management**: Implement tools that allow archivists to easily apply licenses or rights statements to individual and groups of files. This will enable archivists to determine the appropriate usage of files and automate the removal of restrictions on predetermined dates.

2. **Access Restriction Controls**: Develop functionalities to mark individual or groups of files as restricted, with the capability to limit access based on user roles, IP addresses, and specific dates. This aims at preventing unauthorized sharing and viewing of sensitive information.

3. **Easy File Management**: Facilitate batch editing of metadata, high-quality scanning, automatic creation of access copies, and unique identifier assignment to streamline file management processes. Additionally, the project will enable archivists to upload both single and multiple files efficiently.

4. **Advanced Search and Browse Functionalities**: Equip users with the ability to search files by keyword, tag, or structured data and browse through collections seamlessly. This includes enabling OCR (Optical Character Recognition) search capabilities for digitized textual documents to improve research efficiency.

5. **User Access and Engagement**: Create an intuitive online form for licensing archival materials, and ensure that researchers and donor representatives can easily access, request, and share digital artifacts. This includes streaming audio/video files and downloading files for research purposes without needing physical access to reading rooms.

6. **Security and User Management**: Implement robust user management systems, including the creation of user groups and roles with specific permissions, leveraging Active Directory for authentication, and enabling users to reset passwords securely.

7. **Interactivity and Collaboration**: Allow researchers to generate and share structured citation data, share interesting finds on social media, and link electronic versions of publications to citations for collaborative knowledge building.

8. **Outreach and Usability**: Enable the uploading and tagging of educational outreach materials and staff-generated working papers, making them readily accessible to staff and researchers, thereby promoting knowledge dissemination and archival literacy.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to enhance the technological infrastructure supporting digital archives to make archival materials more accessible, manageable, and usable while adhering to legal and ethical standards. By addressing the specific needs of archivists, researchers, and donor representatives, the project aims to foster a more engaged, efficient, and research-friendly environment within the archival community.

**Impact:**
Upon successful implementation, this project will lead to improved archivists' efficiency, enhanced research capabilities, bolstered security for sensitive files, and increased engagement from the global research community. Ultimately, it will contribute to fulfilling the RAC's mission of making as much archival material as possible available for use in a secure and user-friendly manner.

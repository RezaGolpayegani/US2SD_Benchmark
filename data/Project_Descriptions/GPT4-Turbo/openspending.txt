### OpenSpending Enhancement Project

#### Project Overview

The OpenSpending Enhancement Project aims to significantly improve user experience and functionality on the OpenSpending platform, catering to a diverse set of user needs from data publishing to data consumption and API utilization. This project encompasses a series of feature updates and new capabilities designed to streamline data management, enhance data visualization, and broaden the platform's utility for a wide range of stakeholders, including data publishing users, platform administrators, data consuming users, developers, and the OpenSpending community at large.

#### Project Objectives

1. **Data Publishing Enhancements:**
   - Enable users to edit, delete, and import datasets with ease, supporting multiple data formats including Excel, JSON, and Google Spreadsheets.
   - Introduce the ability to edit the data model post-import to fix bugs or implement enhancements.
   - Provide support for constants in the data packager and allow importing data from Fiscal Data Package descriptor files.
   - Allow for the automatic updating of datasets as source files change.
   - Enable publishing datasets in a hidden state for private use or pre-publication adjustments.

2. **Platform Administration Improvements:**
   - Grant administrators the ability to hide public datasets, perform management actions on any dataset, and delete datasets as necessary.
   - Provide a comprehensive view of all datasets published by users for more streamlined platform management.

3. **Data Consumption Features:**
   - Implement filters, sort, and aggregate functions for more granular data views.
   - Allow downloading of CSV files from visualizations and the ability to change the display of monetary measures across different currencies.
   - Enhance map visualizations with consistent color use, stepped zoom, and additional GeoJSON sources for improved map-based visualizations.
   - Introduce functionalities for sharing visualizations through URLs and social networks, along with the capacity to download images of specific view states for offline use.

4. **API and Developer Tools:**
   - Provide API enhancements for better user designation understanding, bordering regions/cities information, flexible usage of HASC codes, and monetary measures conversion.
   - Enable dynamic request for polygons based on queries and metadata usage for building multi-dataset user experiences.
   - Offer customization options for the branding of frontend Javascript applications including brand name, icon, and primary color.

5. **OpenSpending Community Involvement:**
   - Launch an OpenSpending community blog to highlight projects in the open fiscal space.
   - Offer a Python client for efficient data addition to the datastore and an app showcasing examples of fiscal data visualizations.

6. **General Usability Improvements:**
   - Enhance search functionality to allow dataset discovery by title and metadata.
   - Automate visualization preferences for datasets containing multiple years.
   - Enable customization of embedded visualization colors and styling for API users, and translate data types hierarchies in embed mode for platform administrators.

#### Desired Outcomes

By implementing these improvements, the OpenSpending Enhancement Project aims to make fiscal data more accessible, understandable, and usable for individuals and organizations worldwide. The project seeks to facilitate better data management and visualization on the OpenSpending platform, encouraging greater public engagement with fiscal data, and fostering a more informed and active community around fiscal transparency.

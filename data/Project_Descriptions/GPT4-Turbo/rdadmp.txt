### Project Description: Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool)

#### Overview
The Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool, or DMPTool, is an innovative project designed to facilitate and streamline the planning, recording, and management of data throughout all stages of the research lifecycle. Aimed at addressing the diverse needs of researchers, data managers, IT professionals, repository owners, legal officers, and various stakeholders involved in research projects, DMPTool seeks to ensure efficient, secure, and compliant data management practices.

#### Objectives
- To create a centralized platform enabling researchers and project investigators to document and access all metadata associated to their research data efficiently.
- To facilitate detailed planning of data storage, both during and post research projects, ensuring accessibility and compliance with data lifecycle requirements.
- To automate the import of metadata captured with external metadata tools into the DMPTool, eliminating redundancy and promoting accuracy.
- To provide insights into data usage, enhancing support and development of tailored usage scenarios in collaboration with researchers.
- To enable repository owners to verify planned data provenance, calculate submission fees, and ensure alignment with target criteria.
- To assist IT managers in early identification of IT resource requirements for optimizing resource acquisition planning.
- To ensure comprehensive understanding and documentation of security requirements and data sensitivity, facilitating legal compliance and ethical standards adherence.
- To support data managers in maintaining up-to-date and detailed data set descriptions and ensuring alignment with relevant collections or repositories.
- To integrate administrative and project-specific information into DMPs seamlessly from institutional systems, promoting standardization and accuracy.
- To offer repositories and archive managers insights into the volume, format, and preservation periods of data for adequate infrastructure and service planning.

#### Key Features
- An intuitive interface for documenting comprehensive metadata, data storage plans, and security measures.
- Integration capabilities with existing metadata tools and institutional systems for efficient pre-population of DMPs.
- Dynamic data usage tracking and analysis features for data managers and IT staff.
- Provenance checking and cost calculation tools for repository owners.
- IT resource requirement estimations and planning tools.
- Security and sensitivity assessment features aligned with legal and ethical standards.
- Regular summary reports and trend insights for research heads, funders, and institutional managers.
- Enhanced collaboration and role-sharing features for researchers and data managers within departments.

#### Benefits
- Streamlined data management planning processes within a unified platform, reducing redundancy and improving data management efficiency.
- Improved compliance with funder policies, ethical standards, legal requirements, and security protocols.
- Enhanced access and reusability of data, benefiting the broader research community.
- Early and comprehensive planning of IT and storage resources, ensuring scalability and sustainability of research projects.
- Facilitated collaboration among research teams, data managers, and institutional support staff, promoting a culture of comprehensive and proactive data management.

### Project Title: Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project

### Project Description:

The Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project aims to significantly upgrade the Neurohub platform, ensuring it is more accessible, intuitive, and feature-rich for users across various roles, including system administrators, researchers, lab administrators, MRI operators, and more. This ambitious project encompasses the development of automated scripts for Neurohub node installation, functional testing, and acceptance testing, with an emphasis on minimal manual intervention. It also includes improvements in the user interface, data management capabilities, metadata handling, and integration with external tools and repositories.

### Objectives:

1. **Automate Installation and Testing:** Develop scripts to automate the installation of Neurohub on virgin Ubuntu systems and automate acceptance and functionality tests, providing detailed reports on the installation's state and functionality.

2. **Enhance User Experience:** Implement features to improve navigation within Neurohub, such as forward and backward movement between logbook pages without browser dependency, and the capability for users to customize the Web interface's theme.

3. **Advanced Data Management:** Provide robust functionalities for researchers and users to upload, attach, manage, and share files and directories efficiently. This includes features for bulk upload, metadata assignment, and data search capabilities based on various criteria.

4. **Metadata and Data Curation:** Develop standardized metadata templates and controlled vocabularies to ensure consistency and understandability of data across the platform. Provide functionalities for annotating datasets with standard metadata for enhanced searchability and comprehension.

5. **Integration and Compatibility:** Ensure seamless integration with external tools such as Mendeley for research paper management and mapping network drives for easy data access. Also, facilitate the migration of data from older versions of Neurohub to the current version without data loss.

6. **Security and Data Protection:** Implement managed backup protocols, data privacy options, and the ability to restore deleted files or revert to older versions, ensuring data integrity and security.

7. **Collaboration and Sharing:** Enhance collaboration features by allowing users to share data, experimental protocols, and post-experiment reviews easily. Provide support for tagging, linking experimental runs, and giving controlled access to shared data.

8. **Remote and Secure Access:** Allow researchers secure remote access to the Neurohub node for effective off-site working, along with a group-level repository for sharing and collaborating on papers and reviews.

### Outcomes:

- A fully automated installation and testing framework for Neurohub, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent deployments.
- Improved user interface and navigation, making the platform more user-friendly and efficient for all types of users.
- Robust data management system enabling easy upload, organization, sharing, and management of files and datasets, with comprehensive metadata support.
- Enhanced collaboration and sharing mechanisms, promoting knowledge exchange and facilitating more effective teamwork across research groups.
- Secure and reliable access to data, both onsite and remotely, with stringent data protection measures in place.

### Target Users:

This project benefits a wide range of users, including system administrators, researchers, lab administrators, MRI operators, and other stakeholders within the Neurohub user community. It aims to provide a unified, feature-rich platform that meets the diverse needs of its user base, enhancing productivity and collaboration in research activities.

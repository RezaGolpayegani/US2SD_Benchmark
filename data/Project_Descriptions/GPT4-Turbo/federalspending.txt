### Project Title: Comprehensive Broker Platform Enhancement Project

### Project Description:

The Comprehensive Broker Platform Enhancement Project is a multifaceted initiative focused on significantly improving the overall user experience, data integrity, and operational efficiency of the Broker platform. This project encompasses a series of targeted enhancements across various user roles, including Data Users, UI Designers, Developers, DevOps Engineers, and Broker Users. Our principal objective is to streamline the data submission and validation process, introduce a refreshed user interface consistent with the latest design styles, bolster system performance, and ensure rigorous data validation and error handling mechanisms are in place.

Key components of the project include:

- **UI/UX Overhaul:** Redesigning critical pages, such as the Resources page, to align with new Broker design styles. The initiative also involves multiple rounds of edits and approvals for the DABS or FABS landing pages, Homepage, and Help page to enhance navigability and user satisfaction.

- **Data Processing and Validation Improvements:** Addressing specific data user requests, such as processing deletions from 12-19-2017, syncing D1 file generation with FPDS data loads, and ensuring the Broker validation rule table is updated to accommodate new rules. Additionally, improving the handling and notification of FABS submission status changes and ensuring the efficient management of D Files generation requests.

- **Operational Efficiency and Monitoring:** Enabling better logging capabilities for Developers to aid in troubleshooting, incorporating useful data across all applications via New Relic for DevOps engineers, and preventing issues such as double publishing of FABS submissions.

- **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Enhancing error message accuracy for Broker users, ensuring that flexfields in submission files appear correctly in warning and error files, and updating financial assistance data display for website users.

- **Agency and FABS User Enhancements:** Enabling the inclusion of a large number of flexfields without impacting performance, clarifying CFDA error code triggers, updating the FABS sample file, and improving the overall submission and validation process for FABS users.

- **Historical Data and Validation Updates:** Loading historical FABS data with correct FREC derivations, updating Broker resources, validations, and policies for the launch of FABS and DAIMS v1.1, and ensuring all historical Financial Assistance data is loaded for FABS go-live.

- **Testing and User Engagement:** Beginning user testing to validate UI improvement requests, tracking issues raised during Tech Thursdays, and creating summaries from these activities to inform leadership and stakeholders of potential UI improvements.

This project aims to foster a more intuitive, efficient, and reliable platform for all stakeholders involved in the Broker process. By addressing these improvements, the platform will not only meet the current needs of its users but also lay a solid foundation for future enhancements.

### Restaurant Management and Operations System

#### Project Overview
The Restaurant Management and Operations System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate the myriad of tasks associated with running a restaurant. This system addresses the needs of various restaurant stakeholders including cashiers, chefs, cooks, customers, management users, servers, waiters, and other restaurant employees. Its primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business analytics through a centralized platform.

#### Key Features

2. **Menu and Order Management**: Allows chefs to add new dishes, manage ingredient lists, check stock levels, update dish statuses, and view customer feedback. Cooks can also edit product availability, generate restocking reports, and create new customer orders.

3. **Customer Interactions**: Customers can view menus, make reservations, order food, pay bills (partially or in full), check allergy lists, give comments on dishes, and receive translations of menu items.

4. **Management and Reporting**: Management users can monitor daily operations, generate various reports (including sales, employee performance, and inventory levels), manage employee data, adjust menu items, and set promotional strategies.

5. **Employee Management**: All restaurant employees have access to features tailored to their roles, enabling them to manage orders, update menu items, enter and track customer feedback, and view their performance metrics.

6. **Inventory and Supplier Management**: The system supports inventory tracking, alerts for low-stock items, management of supplier orders, and tracking the freshness of ingredients.

7. **Customer Relationship Management**: Features tools for managing customer reservations, complaints, feedback, and enhancing the dining experience through personalized recommendations.

8. **Employee Scheduling and Shift Management**: Helps managers create and adjust work schedules, track employee check-ins/outs, and manage payroll based on hours worked.

### Project Description: Agile Estimation and Planning Tool

**Project Overview:**

The Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT) is a comprehensive web-based application designed to facilitate efficient and accurate estimation sessions within agile development teams. This tool allows moderators to seamlessly create games (estimation sessions), invite team members as estimators, and manage the estimation process through a user-friendly interface. AEPT aims to enhance the collaboration, flexibility, and efficiency of agile estimation practices, catering to the diverse needs of team members including moderators, estimators, participants, developers, researchers, and administrators.

**Key Features:**

1. **Game Creation and Management:**
   - Moderators can initiate a new game by specifying a name and an optional description.
   - Ability to invite estimators to a game through a shareable URL.
   - Comprehensive management options including adding, editing, deleting, and re-estimating items.

2. **Estimation Process:**
   - Starting and conducting estimation rounds with an intuitive interface for submitting estimates.
   - Support for different estimation strategies, including the modified Fibonacci sequence and powers of 2.
   - Real-time display of all estimates, allowing moderators to reveal them at any point to facilitate discussions.
   - Automated and manual acceptance of estimates to move efficiently to the next item.

3. **Integration and Accessibility:**
   - Importing and copying/pasting stories from spreadsheets to quickly populate the game with estimation items.
   - Export functionality to save game transcripts in HTML and CSV formats for record-keeping and further analysis.
   - Designed to be accessible and compliant with XHTML, CSS standards, and W3C accessibility guidelines.

4. **Account Management and Customization:**
   - Secure account creation and login mechanisms for moderators with options to update account details.
   - Customizable settings to view dates and times in local timezone and receive password reminders via email.

5. **Interactive Participant Experience:**
   - Features for estimators to join games, view estimation items, and submit estimates.
   - Functionalities enabling participants to change their estimates, start a two-minute countdown for discussions, and review the history of estimates for better decision-making.
   - Personal touches like displaying thumbnail photos of estimators to foster a more engaging experience.

6. **Performance and Compatibility:**
   - Optimized for responsiveness and quick interaction.
   - Support for major browsers including Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Firefox 1.5 and 2, and Safari 2.
   - Unicode support to accommodate various languages.

7. **Data Analysis and Research:**
   - Non-identifiable storage of results for research and analysis on estimation patterns and team dynamics.
   - Metrics dashboard for administrators to monitor the usage and effectiveness of the tool.

**Objective:**

The objective of the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool is to provide agile teams with a versatile, intuitive, and comprehensive platform for conducting estimation sessions with ease and precision. By integrating best practices in agile estimation with advanced web technologies, AEPT ensures that teams can focus on delivering value while enhancing their planning accuracy and efficiency.

**Target Users:**

The primary users of AEPT include agile team moderators who organize and facilitate estimation sessions, team members participating as estimators, and stakeholders interested in the outcomes of these sessions. Additionally, the tool serves developers by adhering to high standards of web development and accessibility, researchers analyzing estimation data, and administrators overseeing tool usage and performance.

**Technology Stack:**

While the project description does not specify technologies, a typical stack for developing AEPT could include HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like React or Angular for the frontend), a server-side language like Node.js or Python (Django or Flask), and a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Compatibility and performance considerations will guide the choice of technologies to ensure a broad access spectrum and a smooth user experience.

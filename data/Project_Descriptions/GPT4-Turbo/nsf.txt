### Project Title: NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative

#### Project Description:

This project aims to establish a comprehensive development, design, and research framework for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) beta website hosted on cloud.gov. The initiative encompasses a wide array of objectives targeted at setting up a robust online presence that meets the needs of various stakeholders, including NSF employees, researchers, content editors, developers, designers, and the user community at large.

Key components of the project include:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure and Domain Setup**: Establishing the beta iteration on cloud.gov and configuring the subdomain beta.nsf.gov for deployment. This phase focuses on the technical foundation and ensuring adherence to FISMA low requirements for cloud-based hosting.

2. **Design and User Experience**: Creating a new social media wireframe, determining a design direction for the beta site's social page, and establishing brand guidelines to inform the development process. This segment aims at crafting a user-centered design that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

3. **User Research and Testing**: Executing a comprehensive user research plan including in-person interviews, usability testing of the CMS (Content Management System), and reviewing the effectiveness of blog aggregators. This stage is pivotal in capturing insights that will shape the site's content strategy and functional features.

4. **Content Management**: Identifying the most suitable CMS for NSF's needs, informed by user research outcomes and CMS implementation observations. This involves understanding workflow needs, establishing roles within the CMS, and providing recommendations for content design and editorial planning.

5. **Technical Development and Prototyping**: Planning and developing prototypes based on hypotheses around user needs and behaviors. This includes setting up recruitment for user testing, developing strategies for rapid prototyping, and ensuring that the site can incorporate essential features like video content.

6. **Communication and Collaboration**: Ensuring regular check-ins, workshops, and collaborative sessions within the team and with stakeholders to align on project goals, share findings, and refine strategies. This includes leveraging platforms like Github for participatory issue management and documentation.

7. **Training and Documentation**: Providing resources and learning opportunities for NSF staff and team members to understand the project's technical and design aspects, thereby building capability within the NSF for ongoing site development and management.

Throughout the project, a strong emphasis will be placed on adhering to best practices in user-centered design, agile development, and open communication to ensure the beta site effectively serves its intended audiences. The project aims to deliver a robust, research-informed beta site that can evolve based on user feedback and technological advancements, setting a strong foundation for NSF's future web presence.

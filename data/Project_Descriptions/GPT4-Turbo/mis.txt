### Project Title: Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS)

### Project Description:

The Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) is an ambitious project aimed at improving the functionalities and user experience of digital repository systems, focusing on the needs of various stakeholders, including collection curators, repository managers, faculty members, developers, digital records archivists, repoadmins, and the wider user community. This multifaceted project encompasses the development and integration of advanced features to streamline the management, archiving, discovery, and sharing of digital assets within an academic or institutional environment.

### Key Features and Objectives:

1. **Data Lifecycle Management**: Implement mechanisms for setting expiration dates on data, ensuring that data is either hidden or deleted after a predetermined date. This feature will aid curators in managing the lifecycle of data within the repository.

2. **Financial Tracking**: Develop a system to track the financial responsibility for each item in the repository, including detailed contact information of the responsible party. This will enable repository managers to monitor and report on storage costs associated with each financial contact.

3. **Cross-Collection Mapping**: Allow curators to map items across different collections, facilitating the administration of items that may belong to one collection but should appear in others.

4. **Search Functionality Enhancements**: Incorporate date delimiters in search strings to enable more precise search results, catering to the needs of faculty members and researchers.

5. **Replication and Encryption**: Enhance the repository's ability to replicate data to remote storage sites, including the encryption of data for secure transfer and storage.

6. **Embargo Management**: Streamline the process for setting, lifting, and managing embargoes on objects, making it simpler for curators and archivists to control access to sensitive or restricted data.

7. **Integration and Interoperability**: Ensure seamless bidirectional communication between the repository and external systems such as Symplectic Elements, alongside providing support for Fedora 4 migration and enhancing the repository's capability to interact with various data formats and protocols.

8. **User and Group Management**: Introduce tools for managing user permissions, creating deposit groups, and editing embargo lengths, ensuring that access control meets the specific needs of collections and their stakeholders.

9. **Auditing and Reporting**: Implement comprehensive auditing and reporting features to track repository usage, embargo statuses, submission activities, and error logs, providing valuable insights to repository managers and administrators.

10. **Public Access and Engagement**: Improve public-facing features to display embargo statuses, license agreements, and access permissions clearly, enhancing the transparency and usability of the repository for external researchers and visitors.

11. **Disaster Recovery and SLA Transparency**: Develop a robust disaster recovery plan and ensure server SLA details are transparent to data contributors, enhancing trust and reliability in the repository's infrastructure.

### Conclusion:

The EDRMS project promises to revolutionize the way digital repositories operate, making them more efficient, secure, and user-friendly for all stakeholders involved. By addressing the specific needs of various user roles, the project aims to facilitate a more collaborative, transparent, and cost-effective approach to digital asset management within academic and research institutions.

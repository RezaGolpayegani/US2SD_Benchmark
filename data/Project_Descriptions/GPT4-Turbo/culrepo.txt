### Project Description: Comprehensive Digital Repository System for Cornell University

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to develop and implement an advanced digital repository system tailored for Cornell University's diverse academic and research needs. This state-of-the-art system will serve faculty members, students, library staff, administrators, and external patrons, providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for accessing, managing, and disseminating research material, data, and scholarly works. By integrating robust functionalities with user-centric features, the system will enhance the visibility, accessibility, and impact of Cornell's intellectual output across disciplines.

**Key Features:**

1. **Enhanced Access and Discovery:** The system will enable users to easily access and discover a wide range of content, including research materials, datasets, publications, and archival materials via intuitive search and browsing capabilities. This includes mobile access and integration with Shibboleth for secure remote access.

2. **Robust Content Management:** Faculty and library staff can upload individual or batch content, manage versions, apply embargoes, and specify custom metadata fields. The platform will support various media and file formats, ensuring comprehensive representation of scholarly output.

3. **Content Attribution and Reuse:** Facilitate transparent attribution for data and publications through customizable citations and clear display of reuse rights, including Creative Commons licensing options, fostering ethical use and dissemination of works.

4. **Teaching and Research Support:** Faculty members can create collections, direct students to specific materials, and integrate research into teaching. The system will support content linking to enhance educational experiences.

5. **Dynamic Communication and Notification:** Researchers and patrons can subscribe to updates for selected reports or datasets, and receive notifications when new versions or related materials are available. Faculty members will be notified of item downloads to track engagement.

6. **Administrative Functions:** Includes the ability to manage report and dataset errors, name changes, and visibility settings. It will also feature tools for tracking faculty scholarly output, generating usage statistics, and examining altmetrics for informed decision-making and reporting.

7. **Security and Preservation:** The system will assure the redundancy of stored digital copies, continuous monitoring for unwanted changes, and robust preservation practices to ensure long-term access to and integrity of deposited materials.

8. **Collaboration and Sharing:** The platform will encourage collaborative work among departments and schools, and support dissemination of research findings to both academic and non-academic audiences.

9. **Customization and Branding:** Allows for the creation of branded collections to promote the work of specific faculties, departments, or research groups. Customization features will also include the ability to add distinctive metadata fields for specialized content discovery.

**System Integration and Compliance:**
- Integration with current Cornell systems (e.g., Symplectic Elements, Activity Insight) for seamless tracking of scholarly activities.
- Comply with Digital Management Plan (DMP) requirements from funders.
- Support standards for accessibility and data security, ensuring content is available to all users, including those with disabilities.

**Stakeholder Benefits:**
- **Faculty Members:** A central hub to disseminate research, enhance visibility, and fulfill teaching needs.
- **Students:** A rich resource for research, learning, choosing courses, and identifying academic advisors or research opportunities.
- **Library Staff:** Efficient workflows for content uploading, metadata management, and preservation activities.
- **Administrators:** Insights into faculty output and content utilization for academic assessment and policy-making.
- **External Patrons:** Ready access to Cornell's vast repository for research, policy-making, grant writing, and educational purposes.

**Conclusion:**

This digital repository system promises to be a cornerstone for preserving, showcasing, and leveraging Cornell University's academic contributions. It aims to foster an environment of open scholarly communication, elevate the university's research profile, and support the academic community's diverse needs in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

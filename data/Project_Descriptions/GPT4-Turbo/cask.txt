### Project Title: Advanced Dataset Management and Version Control System for Application Ecosystems

#### Project Description:

This project aims to develop a comprehensive dataset management and version control system designed to cater to the specific needs of app developers, dataset developers, data scientists, hydrator users, and plugin developers within an application ecosystem. The system will facilitate the seamless inclusion, deployment, exploration, sharing, and versioning of dataset types and instances, thereby enabling efficient data manipulation and integrity across various applications and pipeline creations.

#### Key Features:

1. **Dataset Type Inclusion and Deployment**: Allow app developers to include the code of a dataset type in their app artifacts, enabling the creation and deployment of datasets of that type alongside the app. This ensures a tightly coupled versioning between the app and its associated datasets.

2. **Version Management**: Facilitate the deployment of new versions of dataset types without affecting existing instances unless explicitly desired. This feature is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing disruptions in multi-app environments.

3. **Shared Dataset Types Across Applications**: Implement mechanisms for sharing dataset types across multiple applications, ensuring that upgrades to shared dataset types only affect the dataset instances associated with the deploying application, thereby preventing unintended side effects on other applications.

4. **Dataset Exploration and Integrity**: Enable app and dataset developers, as well as data scientists, to explore dataset instances and ensure the integrity of data by managing version conflicts effectively. This includes providing insights into dataset configurations, properties, and schemas.

5. **Interface and Implementation Separation**: Separate the interface from the implementation of dataset types to allow apps to rely solely on interfaces with implementations being dynamically injected at runtime. This enhances modularity and facilitates easier unit testing.

6. **Hydrator Pipeline Integration**: Ensure that dataset instances created by apps are available as sources and sinks for hydrator pipelines, integrating explicit version specification for dataset types used in pipelines to handle version compatibility checks.

7. **Custom Administrative Operations**: Empower app developers to perform custom administrative operations on dataset instances, such as compaction and rebalancing, through CLI, REST, or UI.

8. **Upgrade and Migration Support**: Provide dataset developers with tools and options for implementing upgrade steps and migration procedures for dataset instances transitioning to new versions, ensuring smooth upgrades and compatibility checks.

9. **User-Friendly Configuration and Exploration**: Offer users the ability to specify dataset schemas and configurations in a uniform manner across all dataset types, including support for JSON and SQL schema strings, and time-to-live configurations. Additionally, enable dataset exploration features based on user-defined settings.

#### Goal:

To create a robust and user-friendly system that enhances the efficiency of managing datasets within application ecosystems, addresses the diverse needs of different stakeholders, and ensures data compatibility, versioning, and integrity across deployments.

#### Target Audience:

- App Developers
- Dataset Developers
- Data Scientists
- Hydrator Users
- Plugin Developers

#### Outcomes:

By the end of this project, the application ecosystem will benefit from an advanced dataset management and version control system that streamlines workflows, enhances data integrity, and promotes collaboration across different roles involved in app and dataset development processes.

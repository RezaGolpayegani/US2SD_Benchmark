Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
autonumber
actor Reader
entity "Book Review Website" as Website
database "Comment Database" as Database

Reader -> Website: Visit book page
activate Website
Website -> Database: Retrieve comments
activate Database
Database --> Website: Return comments
deactivate Database
Website --> Reader: Display book info and comments
deactivate Website

Reader -> Website: Submit comment for book
activate Website
Website -> Database: Store new comment
activate Database
Database --> Website: Confirm comment stored
deactivate Database
Website --> Reader: Confirm comment posted
deactivate Website
@enduml
```
In this diagram, the Reader interacts with a Website to view and submit comments about books. Those comments are stored in a Database. The autonumber directive is used for automatic numbering of messages. The "->" arrow represents synchronous messages (with immediate response), and the "-->" arrow represents return messages. "activate" and "deactivate" keywords are used to show duration of activities.

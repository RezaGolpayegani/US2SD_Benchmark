Below is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format following from your user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin
entity "Admin Dashboard" as Dashboard
database "Help Wanted Ads Database" as Database

Admin->Dashboard: Login
activate Dashboard
Dashboard-->Admin: Access granted

loop Send request to edit or delete help wanted ad
    Admin->Dashboard: Select Help Wanted Ad
    activate Dashboard
    Dashboard-->Admin: Present Ad Details

    Admin->Dashboard: Request Edit/Delete
    activate Dashboard
    Dashboard->Database: Send Edit/Delete Request
    activate Database
    Database-->Dashboard: Confirm Edit/Delete
    deactivate Database
    Dashboard-->Admin: Confirm Edit/Delete
    deactivate Dashboard
end

```
This sequence diagram assumes that:

- The admin logs into the dashboard.
- The admin selects the ad they want to edit/delete.
- The dashboard presents the details of the ad to the admin.
- The admin sends a request to edit/delete the ad.
- The dashboard forwards the request to the database.
- The database applies the edit/delete and confirms it back to the dashboard.
- The dashboard confirms to the admin that the edit/delete has been applied.
- This loop continues until the admin is done modifying or deleting ads.

Sure, here's a simple PlantUML sequence diagram representation for your user story:

```
@startuml
title Attach File to Experiment Log Page
participant "Researcher" as R
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

R -> S: Clicks 'Create Log Page'
activate S
S --> R: Opens New Log Page
deactivate S

R -> S: Inputs Experiment Data
activate S
S -> D: Save Experiment Data
activate D
D --> S: Acknowledge Save Completion
deactivate D
S --> R: Saved Confirmation Message
deactivate S

R -> S: Click 'Attach File'
activate S
S --> R: Opens File Picker

R -> S: Select File
activate S
S -> D: Save File Data
activate D
D --> S: Acknowledge Save Completion
deactivate D
S --> R: File Attachment Confirmation
deactivate S
@enduml
```

This sequence represents a simple interaction where researcher interacts with the system to create a log page, input the experiment data and attach a file to the log page. In this representation, the system interacts with the database to save both experiment and file data.

Please adjust as necessary based on your software design and project requirement.

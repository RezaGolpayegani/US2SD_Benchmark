Sure. Here is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the interaction between the restaurant employee user and the system in order to prioritize long-awaited orders:

```
@startuml
actor "Restaurant Employee User" as A
participant "Order System" as B

A -> B: Request all active orders
activate B
B -> B: Retrieve All Active Orders
A <-- B: Returns List of Active Orders
A -> B: Sort Orders by Start Date
activate B
B -> B: Sort Retrieved Orders
A <-- B: Return Sorted Order List
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the restaurant employee requests all active orders from the order system, then the system retrieves and returns a list of active orders. The restaurant employee then requests the system to sort the orders by start date. The system again sorts and provides the sorted list back to the user.

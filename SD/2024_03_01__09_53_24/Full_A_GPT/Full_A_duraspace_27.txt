Sure, below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML representing your needs. 

Please replace "RepoMan" with your Repository Manager, "EventLog" with a module or method that records or keeps all object events, and "Object" with the actual object you intend to track. 

```
@startuml
participant "RepoMan" as R
participant "EventLog" as E
participant "Object" as O

R -> E: RequestAllEvents(ObjectId)
activate E

E -> O: getAllEvents()
activate O

O -->> E : EventList
deactivate O

E -->> R : EventList
deactivate E
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram denotes the Repository Manager (RepoMan) making a request to the EventLog for all events on a particular object (Object). The EventLog then requests these events from the actual object, which returns them to the EventLog. The EventLog then returns the list of Events (EventList) to the RepoMan. Each 'activate' and 'deactivate' tag denotes when a participant is active in the sequence.

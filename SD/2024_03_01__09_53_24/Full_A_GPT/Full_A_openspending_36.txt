Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML format. The diagram depicts a flow where API User initiates a request to normalize data by GDP, API backend processes the request, data is normalized at the database level, and the response is returned to the User.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor APIUser
participant API
participant Database

APIUser -> API: Request to normalize data by GDP
activate API

API -> Database: Retrieve raw data and GDP information
activate Database

Database --> API: Return raw data and GDP information
deactivate Database

API -> API: Normalize data by GDP
API --> APIUser: Return normalized data
deactivate API
@enduml
```

You can interpret the above code as follows:

1. User makes an API request to normalize data by GDP.
2. The API retrieves the raw data and the country's GDP from the database.
3. The database sends this data back to the API.
4. The API normalizes the data using the GDP, and then sends it back to the user. 

This is a simplified sequence diagram and depending on how complex the operation, more steps/objects might be involved. You need a PlantUML viewer to visualize this code as a diagram.

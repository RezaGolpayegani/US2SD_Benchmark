Sure, here's a rough sequence structure for your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember
entity ReservationSystem
database LibraryDatabase
LibraryMember --> ReservationSystem: Request to reserve books
ReservationSystem --> LibraryDatabase: Check availability
LibraryDatabase --> ReservationSystem: Confirm availability
alt All books are available
 ReservationSystem --> LibraryMember: Show confirmation of reservation
else If one book or more is not available
 ReservationSystem --> LibraryMember: Show unable to reserve
end
deactivate ReservationSystem
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram might be simplistic depending upon the full details you want to include in the reservation system. It merely represents that a Library Member makes a request to reserve multiple books, the system checks availability in the database confirming the availability, and subsequently either confirms the reservation to the user or denies if any one book or more are not available.

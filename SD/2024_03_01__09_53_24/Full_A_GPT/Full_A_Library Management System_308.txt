Below is the sequence diagram written in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
actor Member
participant System

Member -> System : Request Suggestions
activate System
System -> System : Generate Suggestions
System --> Member : Provide Suggestions
deactivate System
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows a scenario where a Member asks the System to provide suggestions, the System then generates these suggestions and responds back to the Member with them. In this simplification, I made the assumption that the System both generates and provides the suggestions. You may alter the participants according to the actual scenario.

Sure, here's the sequence diagram you requested, represented in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
boundary Site
control ApplicationService
entity Application

Member --> Site : Access Site
Site --> Member : Display Options
Member --> Site : Select CSP Application
Site --> ApplicationService : Request Application Form
ApplicationService --> Application : Fetch Application Form
Application --> ApplicationService : Return Form
ApplicationService --> Site : Deliver Form
Site --> Member : Display Application Form
Member --> Site : Fill and Submit Form
Site --> ApplicationService : Submit Completed Form
ApplicationService --> Application : Store Form Data
@enduml
```

Here's what each part of the diagram means:

1. The site member ("Member") wants to apply for the Certified Scrum Practitioner (CSP) certification, so they access the website ("Site").
2. The site displays various options to the member.
3. The member selects the CSP Application option.
4. The site, via the ApplicationService, requests the application form.
5. The ApplicationService asks the Application entity to fetch the application form.
6. The Application entity fetches the form and returns it to the ApplicationService.
7. The ApplicationService delivers the form to the Site.
8. The Site displays the application form to the Member.
9. The Member fills out and submits the form.
10. The Site submits the completed application form to the ApplicationService.
11. The ApplicationService stores the form data in the Application entity.

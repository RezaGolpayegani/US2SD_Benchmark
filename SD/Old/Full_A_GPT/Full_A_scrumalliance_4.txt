You can create a Sequence Diagram using PlantUML language. Here is an example corresponding to your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Membership Site" as MS
participant "Application Form" as AF
participant "Scrum Trainer Certifier" as STC

User -> MS : Login to account

alt Not Yet Applied
    MS -> User : Provide trainer certification application
    User -> AF : Fillout form
    AF -> STC : Submit application
    STC -> User : Notify submission confirmation
else Already Applied
    MS -> User : Show application status
end
@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates that a "User", after logging into the "Membership Site" (MS), either goes through the process of filling out and submitting an "Application Form" (AF) to the "Scrum Trainer Certifier" (STC) if they have not yet applied, or is shown their application status if they have already applied.

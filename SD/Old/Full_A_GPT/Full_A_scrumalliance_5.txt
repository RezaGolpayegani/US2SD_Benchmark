Sure, here's a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML language for your user story:

```
@startuml
actor Trainer as t
participant "Profile System" as ps

t -> ps : Request Profile Edit
ps -> t : Display Editable Profile
t -> ps : Update Profile Details
ps -> ps : Validate Changes
ps -> t : Confirm Changes
@enduml
```

More detailed diagrams might include the database as a participant for saving and fetching profile details, or a validation layer if there's complicated logic involved in checking the acceptability of the new profile information. In this case, this simple diagram should give a basic view of the sequence of interactions in this user story. 

Explanation:

1. The Trainer (actor) makes a request to the Profile System (participant) to edit the profile.
2. The Profile System presents the editable profile to the Trainer.
3. The Trainer sends the updated profile data back to the Profile System.
4. The Profile System validates the changes (possibly ensuring there are no inappropriate contents, or that the new info adheres to in-place guidelines).
5. After validation, the Profile System confirms these changes back to the Trainer. 

Note: This code is to be placed in a PlantUML environment to properly view the sequence diagram.

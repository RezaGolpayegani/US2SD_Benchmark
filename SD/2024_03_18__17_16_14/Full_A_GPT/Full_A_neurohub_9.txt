Sure, Here's how you might represent this in Plant UML:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Attach_File_to_Experiment_Log_Book_Page

actor Researcher
boundary "LogBook Page" as LBP
control "Database Manager" as DM

Researcher -> LBP : Create_LogBook_Page()
activate LBP

LBP -> DM : Request_Save_Page()
activate DM

DM --> LBP : Confirm_Page_Saving()
deactivate DM 

Researcher -> LBP : Attach_File()
activate LBP

LBP -> DM : Request_Save_File()
activate DM

DM --> LBP : Confirm_Filing_Saving()
deactivate DM 

deactivate LBP
@enduml
```

According to the diagram:

1. The Researcher creates a Logbook page.
2. The Logbook page requests to save the page to the Database Manager.
3. The Database Manager confirms page saving back to the Logbook page.
4. The Researcher attaches a file.
5. The Logbook page requests to save the attached file to the Database Manager.
6. The Database Manager confirms file saving back to the Logbook page.

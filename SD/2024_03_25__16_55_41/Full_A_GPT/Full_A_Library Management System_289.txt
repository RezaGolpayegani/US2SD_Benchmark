Sure. Below is an example of how the sequence diagram in Plant UML format for this user story could look. Please note that the code only showcases very high-level functionality and an actual implementation will likely be more detailed.

The following plantUML code can be used for creating the sequence diagram. You can copy this code and paste it in an online plantUML creator to view the diagram:

```plantUML
@startuml
actor Member as M
participant "Web-based \nLibrary Management System" as LMS
database "Library Database" as DB
 
M->LMS: Request to view due date
LMS->DB: Query due date for borrower
DB-->LMS: Return due date
LMS-->M: Return due date
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
1. The Member (M) sends a message to the Library Management System (LMS) to view the due date.
2. The LMS then forwards the request to the Library Database (DB).
3. The Database retrieves the required due date information and sends it back to the LMS.
4. Finally, the LMS forwards the due date information to the Member.

Please note that this is just a high level view and the actual implementation of the sequence diagram can have many other factors such as authentication, error handling etc. involved.

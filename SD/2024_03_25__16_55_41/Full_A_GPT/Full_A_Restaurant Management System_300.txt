Based on the provided user story, here is a sample of how a sequence diagram can be written in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Restaurant Management \nSoftware (RMS)" as RMS
database "Menu Items DB" as DB

Waiter -> RMS : Check Order Items Availability
activate RMS
RMS -> DB : Request Order Items Availability
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Respond with Availability Status
deactivate DB
RMS --> Waiter : Show Order Items Availability
deactivate RMS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram depicts that the waiter starts the process by sending a request to the Restaurant Management Software (RMS) to check the availability of order items. From there, the RMS interacts with the Menu Items Database (DB) to fetch the required information. The DB responds back to RMS with the current availability status of the order items. Finally, RMS communicates back to the Waiter and presents the availability status.

Note: This is a sample realistic sequence diagram as per the user story, the actual implementation may vary based on the business rules and software architecture.

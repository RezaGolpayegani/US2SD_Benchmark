Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this user story in Plant UML format would require understanding the detailed system architecture and processes. However, I can provide an example that describes the possible interactions between functional modules of the system based on user story given.

Please note this is an abstracted example, and the real sequence diagram might be more complex depending on factors that aren't mentioned in the given context.

```
@startuml
Actor Owner
Owner -> USAspending: Request for grant records
activate USAspending
USAspending -> GrantRecords: Obtain records
activate GrantRecords
GrantRecords --> USAspending : Return Records
deactivate GrantRecords
USAspending -> RecordFilter: Validate records
activate RecordFilter
RecordFilter --> USAspending: Return grant records
deactivate RecordFilter
USAspending --> Owner: Send grant records
deactivate USAspending
@enduml
```

In this sequence, "Owner" initiates the sequence by requesting for grant records from "USAspending." "USAspending" then interacts with "GrantRecords" to obtain the available records. Then "USAspending" executes a record filtering/validation process via "RecordFilter" to ensure only grant records are returned. Once the filtering/validation process confirms that only grant records are returned, these records are sent back to the "Owner" by "USAspending."

Again, this is a generalized example and might not reflect the actual processes of your system.

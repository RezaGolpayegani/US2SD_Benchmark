Unfortunately, as a text-based digital assistant, I'm unable to directly create diagrams or visual content. However, I can provide you with the PlantUML script to generate a sequence diagram based on your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "EmployeeGUI" as E
participant "OrderManagementSystem" as O
participant "DatabaseService" as D

activate E
E -> O : EnterNoteToOrder(orderID, note)
activate O 
O -> D : SaveOrderNote(orderID, note)
activate D
D --> O : ConfirmationMessage
deactivate D
O --> E : ConfirmationMessage
deactivate O
deactivate E
@enduml
```

In the script:
- "EmployeeGUI" refers to the interface used by the employee.
- "OrderManagementSystem" symbolizes the system handling the order management.
- "DatabaseService" refers to the backend service that handles database-related operations like saving notes to orders.

The script describes the following sequence:
1. The employee enters a note to an order through the GUI.
2. The GUI forwards this information to the OrderManagementSystem.
3. The OrderManagementSystem then sends a request to save this note to the DatabaseService.
4. DatabaseService saves this note and sends back a confirmation message to OrderManagementSystem.
5. The OrderManagementSystem then forwards this confirmation message to the GUI for the employee to see.

Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram for the mentioned user story:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor RepositoryManager
participant DAMS
participant Collection
participant Role

RepositoryManager -> DAMS : IndicateNameRole(collectionID, objectID, componentName, name, role)
activate DAMS

DAMS -> Collection : GetCollection(collectionID)
activate Collection
Collection --> DAMS : CollectionData
deactivate Collection

DAMS -> DAMS : GetObject(objectID, CollectionData)
activate DAMS
DAMS --> DAMS : ObjectData
deactivate DAMS

DAMS -> DAMS : GetComponent(componentName, ObjectData)
activate DAMS
DAMS --> DAMS : ComponentData
deactivate DAMS

DAMS -> Role : AssignRole(name, role)
activate Role
Role --> DAMS : confirmationMessage
deactivate Role

DAMS --> RepositoryManager : confirmationMessage
deactivate DAMS

```
This sequence diagram assumes that each of the participants, `DAMS`, `Collection`, and `Role` have certain actions they can perform. When a `RepositoryManager` wants to assign a role to a name relevant to a collection, object, or object component, they tell the `DAMS` to do so. `DAMS` retrieves the relevant collection, object, and component data, assigns the role, and then communicates success back to the `RepositoryManager`. Note that this is a simplified diagram and the exact details would depend on the specific architecture and implementation of the DAMS.

As an AI model, I'm unable to create visual diagrams. But I can certainly describe a sequence diagram in the plant UML format for the given user story.

```plantUML
@startuml

participant "Manager" as A
database "Restaurant Database" as B
participant "Restaurant Management System" as C

A -> C : Request data on customer orders
activate A
activate C

C -> B : Query customer orders
activate B

B -->> C : Returns customer order details
deactivate B

C -->> A : Generate and Display Report
deactivate C
deactivate A

@enduml
```

Here is the detailed explanation:

1. The Manager (A) sends a request to the Restaurant Management System (C) to get data on customer orders.
2. The Restaurant Management System (C) receives the request from the Manager (A), then sends a query to the Restaurant Database (B) to retrieve this data.
3. The Restaurant Database (B) performs the query and returns the results (in this case, customer order details) to the Restaurant Management System (C).
4. The Restaurant Management System (C) takes the data and generates a report containing information about customer orders. This report is then displayed for the Manager (A) to view.
5. The Manager (A) can now see which customer orders are recurring and make any necessary business decisions. 

Remember, you should view this in a PlantUML viewer to see the actual Sequence diagram.

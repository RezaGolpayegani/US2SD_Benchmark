Sorry, as a text-based model, I'm unable to draw diagrams. However, I can describe you how to generate a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for your User Story. 

Here is a theoretical example of how your code should look like:

```
@startuml
participant "Data Reuser" as D
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Database" as DB

activate D
D -> W: Request to view dataset
activate W
W -> DB: Fetch dataset details
activate DB
DB -->> W: Return dataset details
deactivate DB

W -> D: Display dataset details
deactivate W

D -> W: Request citation example
activate W
W -> DB: Fetch citation example
activate DB
DB -->> W: Return citation example
deactivate DB

W -> D: Display citation example
deactivate W

deactivate D
@enduml
```

In this scenario, "Data Reuser" makes a request to view the dataset through the "Web Interface." The Interface then fetches the dataset details from the "Database" and returns them to the "Data Reuser." Then, the "Data Reuser" requests for the citation example, which the "Web Interface" fetches from the "Database" and then displays to the "Data Reuser".

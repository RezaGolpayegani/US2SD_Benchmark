Sure, below you would find a simple interaction outlined in PlantUML language:

```puml
@startuml

participant "OlderPerson" as A
participant "ALFRED" as B
participant "Game: Memory Test" as C
participant "Game: Physical Test" as D

A -> B : Request for Games
activate B
B -> C : Create Memory Test
activate C
B <- C : Memory Test Created
deactivate C
B -> D : Create Physical Test
activate D
B <- D : Physical Test Created
deactivate D
B -> A : Present Games
deactivate B
@enduml
```
This example illustrates the sequence of actions involved when an older person requests for games. The ALFRED system interacts with the two sample games described, Memory Test and Physical Test. Please note that this is a simple example and actual implementation might require more complex interactions, particularly with games. You might need to consider different states or conditions in a game and the user's responses to these.

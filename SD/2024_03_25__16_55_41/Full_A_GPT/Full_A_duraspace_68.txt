Sure, Here is the sequence diagram in Plant UML plain text format for the user story -

```
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DAMS"
participant "Database"

RM -> DAMS : Request for changes
activate DAMS
DAMS -> Database : Fetch changes to language(s)
activate Database
Database --> DAMS : Return changes
deactivate Database
DAMS --> RM : Show changes
deactivate DAMS
@enduml
```
Please note that you will need a PlantUML viewer or online compiler to visualize the sequence diagram. This diagram considers a Repository Manager flagging requests to the DAMS system for changes, with the system retrieving and returning the requested data from the database. 

Depending on the specifics of the DAMS implementation and the communication, this diagram might need further adjustments to accurately represent your project.

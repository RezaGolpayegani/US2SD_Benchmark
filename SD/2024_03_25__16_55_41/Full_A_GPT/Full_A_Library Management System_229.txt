To represent this user story in a PlantUML sequence diagram, we'll need to consider interactions between a select few entities: the Manager, Database, and Library System. Below, is a minimal sequence diagram how this process may look.

```
@startuml
actor Manager
participant Library_System
database Database

Manager -> Library_System: Request to track new books
activate Manager
activate Library_System

Library_System -> Database: Fetch data on newly added books
activate Database

Database --> Library_System: Return data on new books
deactivate Database

Library_System --> Manager: Display new books information
deactivate Library_System
deactivate Manager

@enduml
```

Explanation: 

- The manager initiates the sequence by requesting to track new books that have been added to the collection monthly.
- The Library System, upon receiving the request, fetches the relevant data from the Database.
- The Database returns the requested data (newly added books for a said month).
- The Library System, having received the data, displays this information to the manager.

Note: This is a very simplified version of the sequence diagram. The actual diagram can be more elaborate depending upon the number of steps, other actors involved, alternates, and exceptions to the normal flow. This should provide a good starting point.

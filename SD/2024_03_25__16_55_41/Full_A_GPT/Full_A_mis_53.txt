As an AI, I'm not capable of drawing diagrams or creating visual representation but I can give you the basic text which you could use to create a sequence diagram in Plant UML.

This user story implies that the data contributor needs to be able to access the Disaster Recovery Plan and reference it appropriately. Here's an example of how the sequence of interactions would look like:

```plantuml
@startuml
"Data Contributor" -> "Repository Management System": Request Disaster Recovery Plan
"Repository Management System" -> "Repository Management System": Verifies User Role (data contributor)
alt User Role Verification Successful
    "Repository Management System" -> "Disaster Recovery Plan Module": Fetch Disaster Recovery Plan Information
    "Disaster Recovery Plan Module" ->  "Disaster Recovery Plan Database": Retrieve Disaster Recovery Plan
    "Disaster Recovery Plan Database" --> "Disaster Recovery Plan Module": Return Plan Information
    "Disaster Recovery Plan Module" --> "Repository Management System": Return Plan Information
    "Repository Management System" --> "Data Contributor": Provide Disaster Recovery Plan Information
else User Role Verification Failed
    "Repository Management System" --> "Data Contributor": Show Permission Denied Error
end
@enduml 
```
Above mentioned text describes interactions in the system when the data contributor requests to refer to the Disaster Recovery Plan. If the data contributor has the appropriate permissions, the system retrieves the necessary information. Otherwise, the system sends an error message to the data contributor.

You would need to copy that text into your Plant UML editor to get the sequence diagram.

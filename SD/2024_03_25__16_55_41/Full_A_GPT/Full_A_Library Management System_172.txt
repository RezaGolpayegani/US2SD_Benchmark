Unfortunately, it's impossible to generate detailed sequence diagrams in PlantUML format through text mediums like this one due to graphical nature of UML diagrams. However, the pseudo-code below explains how a sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to reserve more than one book" might look. 

```
@startuml
title Reserve Multiple Books

actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Library Management System" as system
participant "Book Inventory" as inventory

member -> system: Request to reserve books
activate system

system -> inventory: Check book availability
activate inventory

inventory -->> system: Return book availability
deactivate inventory

alt If books are available
  system -->> member: Show available books
  member -> system: Select books and confirm reservation
  system -> inventory: Reserve selected books
  activate inventory
  inventory -->> system: Confirm reservation
  deactivate inventory
  system -->> member: Reserve confirmation
else If books are not available
  system -->> member: Show unavailable message
end

deactivate system

This sequence diagram describes the interaction between a library member, library management system, and book inventory for reserving multiple books. It handles two different conditions: when the books requested by the library member are available and when they are not available. For the first case, it confirms the reservation after the member selects the books and for the second case, it displays an unavailable message to the member.

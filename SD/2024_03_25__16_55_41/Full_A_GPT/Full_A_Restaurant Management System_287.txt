I'm sorry that as a text-based AI model, I can't create diagrams. However, I can help you to outline the steps to create a sequence diagram for the User Story in Plant UML format:

1. Waiter invokes the function to display the menu
2. Function requests menu items from the database 
3. The database sends back the list of menu items
4. The function then parses these menu items and returns them to the waiter 
5. Waiter then displays this information to the customer

This would look something like this in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
entity Function
database Database

Waiter -> Function: invoke displayMenu()
Function -> Database: getMenuItems()
Database --> Function: return menu_items
Function --> Waiter: return parsed_menu_items
Waiter -> Customer: showMenu()
@enduml
```
Note: For the sake of simplicity this sequence diagram does not take errors or exceptions into account, that would need to be handled in a real world software design. Additionally, you can refine the diagram by specifying the menu items or further detailing how the waiter shows the menu to the customer.

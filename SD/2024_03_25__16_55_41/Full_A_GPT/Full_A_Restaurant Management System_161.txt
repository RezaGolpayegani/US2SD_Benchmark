Sure, based on the description/user story shared, I'll help you generate a sequence diagram represented using PlantUML language, mainly from the perspective of a Manager. Please note that due to the text-based medium, it might be a little tricky to visualize the actual diagram. For that, you would need to use a PlantUML editor/compiler to see the graphical representation of this code.

PlantUML Diagram:

```
@startuml
participant Manager
participant RestaurantManagementSystem
participant Database

Manager -> RestaurantManagementSystem: Request total sales and profit 
activate RestaurantManagementSystem
RestaurantManagementSystem -> Database: Fetch total sales and profit data
activate Database
Database -->> RestaurantManagementSystem: Return total sales and profit data
deactivate Database
RestaurantManagementSystem -->> Manager: Display total sales and profit
deactivate RestaurantManagementSystem

Manager -> RestaurantManagementSystem: Request detail of all employees
activate RestaurantManagementSystem
RestaurantManagementSystem -> Database: Fetch details of all employees (name, role, work hours etc.)
activate Database
Database -->> RestaurantManagementSystem: Return details of all employees
deactivate Database
RestaurantManagementSystem -->> Manager: Display details of all employees
deactivate RestaurantManagementSystem

Manager -> RestaurantManagementSystem: Calculate salaries based on data received
activate RestaurantManagementSystem
RestaurantManagementSystem -> RestaurantManagementSystem: Perform calculation of salaries (considering the total sales, profit and employee detail)
RestaurantManagementSystem -->> Manager: Display calculated salaries
deactivate RestaurantManagementSystem

Please copy this code into a PlantUML editor/compiler to visualize the actual sequence diagram.

Remember, this is a pretty high level sequence and one could add more steps or branches during the analysis, for example error handling, or decision paths where the sequence might change under different conditions.

As an AI, I cannot produce diagrams directly; however, I can provide you with a code script that you can use in your PlantUML tool to generate a sequence diagram. Here is a simple code for the scenario "As a waiter, I want to view menu".

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter
participant Management_System as MS
participant Database

Waiter -> MS: Request to view menu
activate MS
MS -> Database: Fetch menu list
activate Database
Database --> MS: Send menu list
deactivate Database
MS --> Waiter: Display menu list
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

For this code to illustrate the following process:
1. Waiter requests to view the menu from the Restaurant Management System.
2. The system requests the menu list from the database.
3. The database sends the menu list to the management system.
4. The management system displays the menu list to the waiter.

You need to use a PlantUML tool to turn this code into a visual sequence diagram.

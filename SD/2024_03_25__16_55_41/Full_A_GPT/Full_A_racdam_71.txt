As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I'm currently unable to create visual content or diagrams such as a Sequence Diagram using PlantUML. I can suggest a general description of how the sequence will flow and then you can use a tool to create a diagram:

1. **User action:** The researcher interacts with the system to access a specific archival element.
2. **System interaction:** The archiving system fetches the archival element metadata. 
3. **Archival element:** The retrieved archival element metadata includes cross-collection citation information related to the requested archival element.
4. **System interaction:** The archiving system generates a proper citation information that includes all the relevant originating sources.
5. **User action:** The researcher saves or bookmarks the citation for future reference. 

In terms of the PlantUML code, it will look something like this:

```
@startuml
title Fetch Cross-Collection Citation Information
actor Researcher as R
participant "Archiving System" as S
database "Archival Elements" as A

R -> S: Requests archival element
S -> A: Fetches archival element metadata
A --> S: Retrieves metadata and cross-collection citation info
S --> R: Generate and display cross-collection citation
R -> S: Saves bookmarked citation
@enduml
```

You can enter this code directly into an online or standalone PlantUML tool to render the diagram.

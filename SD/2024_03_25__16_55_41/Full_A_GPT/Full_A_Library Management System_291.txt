The sequence diagram is a technical representation and therefore cannot be visually portrayed in this text environment, but I can provide a textual representation of a PlantUML sequence diagram code based on the user story.

```plantuml
@startuml

title Sequence Diagram: View Other Members' Comments

actor User as Member
database Server
entity LibraryDatabase

Member -> Server : ViewCommentsRequest()
Server -> LibraryDatabase: getComments()
LibraryDatabase --> Server: commentsList
Server --> Member: showComments(commentsList)
note over Member : Member sees other \n members' comments
@enduml
```

This diagram represents the sequence of steps which will be followed to fulfill the user story. It starts with a member (an actor) sending a "ViewCommentsRequest" to the Server. The server forwards this request to the Library Database and retrieves all the comments (getComments()). The Library Database in return sends the list of comments (commentsList) back the Server, and the Server then sends back this list (showComments()) to the Member, resulting in the member viewing all the other members' comments.

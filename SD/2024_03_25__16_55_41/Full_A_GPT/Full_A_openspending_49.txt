Users won't be able to visualize or generate a sequence diagram in plain text format which is the output format of this model. However, I will provide a sequence of steps that you can convert into a sequence diagram in PlantUML.

Step 1: User accesses the data management and visualization platform
Step 2: User selects the 'Search data' option on the platform
Step 3: User enters the title or metadata of the dataset in the search field
Step 4: The platform fetches datasets related to the search query 
Step 5: The platform verifies the public accessibility status of the fetched datasets
Step 6: The platform returns the list of publicly accessible datasets matching the search query
Step 7: User views the returned list of datasets 

In PlantUML Code:

@startuml
participant "Data Consumer User" as A
participant "Platform" as B

A -> B: Accesses platform
A -> B: Selects 'Search data'
A -> B: Enters dataset title/metadata
B -> B: Fetches matching datasets
B -> B: Verifies public accessibility
B -> A: Returns list of publicly accessible datasets
A -> B: Views datasets

Please note: you'll have to visualize this on your PlantUML editor to get the graph.

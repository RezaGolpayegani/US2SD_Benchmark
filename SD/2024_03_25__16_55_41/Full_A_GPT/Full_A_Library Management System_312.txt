I'm an AI language model developed by OpenAI and I currently can't generate diagrams or visual content. However, I can guide you to create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for your user story. 

In your user story, the "Member" wants to "Update online reservations for books". You can create this sequence with the following steps in PlantUML notations:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Update Online Reservations for Books

actor Member
entity "Library System" as LS
database "Reservation Database" as RD

Member -> LS : Request Update Reservation(Book ID, Member ID, Reservation Details)
LS -> RD : Validate Member ID and Book ID
RD --> LS : Validation Result
LS -> RD : Update Reservation(Book ID, Member ID, Reservation Details)
RD --> LS : Update Confirmation
LS --> Member : Reservation Update Status
@enduml
```

This is a basic flow where:

1. The Member requests to update their reservation with a specific Book ID, Member ID and Reservation Details.
2. The Library System validates the Member ID and Book ID with the Reservation Database.
3. The Reservation Database returns the validation result to the Library System.
4. If validation was successful, the Library System requests the Reservation Database to update the reservation.
5. The Reservation Database sends an update confirmation to the Library System.
6. Finally, the Library System informs the Member about the status of their reservation update.

This is a simple sequence diagram. Depending on your project, there may be more steps involved or more systems interacting.

Based on the mentioned user story, the following is a Plant UML Sequence Diagram:

```PlantUML
@startuml
title Add Future Release Dates As DB/IR Administrator

actor "DB/IR Administrator" as admin
participant "Repository System" as system
participant "Calendar Management" as calendar
participant "Notification Service" as notify

admin -> system : Login(credentials)
activate system
system -> admin : Authenticate User Role
admin <-- system : Access as DB/IR Administrator

admin -> system : Select Dataset/Report
activate system
system -> admin : Display Dataset/Report Details

admin -> system : Set Future Release Date
deactivate system
system -> calendar : Update Release Date
activate calendar
calendar --> system : Confirm Update

system -> notify : Schedule Patron Notification
activate notify
notify --> system : Confirm Schedule

system -> admin : Confirm Release Date and Notification
deactivate notify
deactivate calendar
@enduml
```

In this diagram, the DB/IR Administrator logs into the repository system. The system authenticates the user role and if correct, it grants access as an administrator. The administrator selects the dataset/report for which they want to add a future release date. The system updates this information on the calendar management system, and schedules a patron notification for the upcoming release. Confirmations are sent to the DB/IR Administrator.

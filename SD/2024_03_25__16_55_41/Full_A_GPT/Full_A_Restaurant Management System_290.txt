Creating a PlantUML sequence diagram requires proper formatting. For the given user story, the sequence could break down as follows:

1. Waiter enters order details.
2. The system receives order details.
3. The system assigns the order to relevant cooks.
4. The system logs the order.

Here is the PlantUML code to outline this process:

```
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Management System" as MS
participant Cook

Waiter -> MS: EnterOrderDetails()
activate MS
MS -> MS: ReceiveOrderDetails()
MS --> Cook: AssignOrder()
deactivate MS
Cook -> Cook: LogOrder()

@enduml
```

In this code:

- `actor Waiter` - The actor who initiates actions in the system.
- `participant "Management System" as MS` - The participant who interacts with the actor.
- `participant Cook` - The participant who performs actions in this sequence diagram.
- `->` - The arrow denotes the message passed from one participant to another.
- `activate` - Begins a section showing the participant is active.
- `deactivate` - Ends the section showing the participant is no longer active.

Please use any online compiler to get the sequence diagram from the provided PlantUML code.

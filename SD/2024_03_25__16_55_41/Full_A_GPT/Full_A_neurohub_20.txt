Since this is an AI model, I don't have the capability to draw a diagram, but I can help provide the necessary plant UML code to generate a sequence diagram based on the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultTextAlignment left

Actor Supervisor
Participant Neurohub
Participant Database

Supervisor -> Neurohub : Request researcher activity log for specific date/period
Neurohub -> Database : Query researcher activities on requested date
activate Database
Database --> Neurohub : Return queried data
deactivate Database
Neurohub --> Supervisor : Display researcher activities on date/period.
@enduml
```

To visualize this sequence diagram, please copy and paste the code into an online plantUML editor. This sequence diagram helps illustrate the interaction process between the supervisor and the Neurohub through the request for a researcher's activity log for a certain date or time period.

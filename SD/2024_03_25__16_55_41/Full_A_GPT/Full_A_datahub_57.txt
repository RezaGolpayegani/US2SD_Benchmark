Sequence diagrams provide a visual depiction of interaction sequences among objects in a certain period. PlantUML is a tool that renders text into UML diagrams, allowing for swift diagram updates and management.

Based on the user story provided, here is a PlantUML sequence diagram description:

```
@startuml
participant "Owner" as O
participant "Platform / System" as S
participant "Invitee" as I

O->S: Access Platform 
activate S
S->O: Provide Access to Publisher Dashboard

O->S: Request Invitation Form
S->O: Provide Invitation Form

O->S: Submit Invitee Email
activate S
S->I: Send Invitation Email
deactivate S

I->S: Clicks Invitation Link
activate S
S->I: Provide Signup Form

I->S: Submit Signup Form
activate S
S->I: Confirm Registration
deactivate S

S->O: Notify about Successful Addition
deactivate S
@enduml
```

In this diagram, the owner accesses the platform and requests the invitation form. The system provides the form, and the owner submits the email of the invitee. The system sends out an invitation to the invitee. They click the link from the email and are provided with a signup form. After submission, the system confirms their registration and finally notifies the owner about the successful addition of a new member.

Creating a sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on the user story will require the use of PlantUML development tools. However, describing a sequence diagram here:

1. Moderator accesses the web-based game.
2. Moderator logs into their account.
3. Moderator selects the game in which the item they wish to edit exists.
4. Moderator clicks on the manage round option.
5. Moderator selects the item to be edited from the list of items.
6. Moderator makes necessary changes in the item details.
7. Moderator confirms the edit.

The PlantUML format code would be written as follows:

```
@startuml
actor Moderator
boundary "Game Portal" as GP
database "Game Database" as GD

Moderator -> GP: Login
activate GP
GP -> GD: Validate Moderator Credentials
activate GD
GD --> GP: Validation Response
deactivate GD
GP --> Moderator: Access Granted
deactivate GP
activate Moderator
Moderator -> GP: Select Game
activate GP
GP -> GD: Retrieve Game Data
activate GD
GD --> GP: Return Game Data
deactivate GD
GP --> Moderator: Display Selected Game
deactivate GP
Moderator -> GP: Click Manage Round
activate GP
GP --> Moderator: Display Items List
deactivate GP
Moderator -> GP: Select Item to Edit
activate GP
GP --> Moderator: Display Item Details
deactivate GP
Moderator -> GP: Edit Item Details
activate GP
GP -> GD: Update Item Details
activate GD
GD --> GP: Update Confirmation
deactivate GD
GP --> Moderator: Confirm Edit
deactivate GP

This PlantUML code would generate a sequence diagram involving actors such as Moderator, a boundary called 'Game Portal', and a database called 'Game Database'. Each arrow indicates a process or interaction between these actors. Activation and deactivation bars represent the start and end of an interaction, respectively.

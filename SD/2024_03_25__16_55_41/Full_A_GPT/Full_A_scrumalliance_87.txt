In order to create a Sequence Diagram for this User Story in PlantUML format, you would need to identify the actors and their interactions. The actors could include the Site Editor and the Email System. Below is a very simplified and generalized representation of the mentioned User Story:

```
@startuml
participant "Site Editor" as A
participant "Email System" as B

A -> B: Request to edit email content
note right: Site Editor makes a request to edit the content of the email.
activate B

B --> A: Open email content editor
note right: The email system opens an email content editor for the Site Editor.
deactivate B
activate A

A -> B: Submit edited content
note right: Site Editor submits the desired changes to the email content.
deactivate A
activate B

B --> A: Confirm changes
note right: The email system confirms that the changes have been successfully made.
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This diagram suggests that the Site Editor requests to edit the content of the email from the Email System, which responds by opening an editor for the Site Editor. The Site Editor, after making the desired changes, submits the new content to the Email System. The Email System then confirms that the changes have been successfully made.

Please note that this diagram might vary based on the specific features and functionalities of your system. The above diagram is quite simplified, and a detailed diagram might have more interactions based on specifics not mentioned in the user story. For example, the diagram does not include any system controls for validating and saving the edited content, error handling or user notifications. It's recommended to include those details in your actual sequence diagram.

Sorry, as a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the capability to draw diagrams but I can give you a basic idea of how to construct a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story.

Here's a textual structure you can use as a guide:

```
@startuml
title Library Manager Book and Checkout Sequence

participant "Library Manager" as LM
participant "Book Registry" as BR
participant "Checkout System" as CS

LM -> BR: SearchBook(bookID)
activate BR
BR -> BR: findBookByID(bookID)
note right: Searches for a book \nby the given ID.
BR --> LM: ReturnBookInfo
deactivate BR

LM -> CS: CheckoutBook(custID, bookID)
activate CS
CS -> CS: processCheckout(custID, bookID)
note right: Process the book checkout \nfor the customer.
CS --> LM: ReturnCheckoutStatus
deactivate CS

LM -> BR: UpdateBookStatus(bookID, status)
activate BR
BR -> BR: updateBook(bookID, status)
note right: The book status is updated \nto "checked out".
BR --> LM: ReturnUpdatedBookInfo
deactivate BR
@enduml
```

In this sequence:

1. The Library Manager (LM) requests the Book Registry (BR) to search for a book with a specific ID.
2. The Book Registry finds the book using the given ID. This info is returned to the Library Manager.
3. The Library Manager then commands the Checkout System (CS) to check out a book for a customer with a specific ID.
4. The Checkout System processes the checkout and returns the checkout status to the Library Manager.
5. The Library Manager updates the status of the book in the Book Registry to indicate that it has been checked out.
6. The Book Registry updates the book's status and returns the updated book info to the Library Manager.

Please note: you would have to use an actual PlantUML tool to visualize this generated sequence diagram.

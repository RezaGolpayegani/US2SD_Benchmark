Here's a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format to illustrate the User Story: 

```
@startuml
participant "Library Staff Member" as A
participant "Data Repository System" as B
participant "Metadata" as C

A -> B: Log in using staff credentials
activate B
B --> A: Access granted
deactivate B

A -> B: Request access to metadata fields of a project
activate B
B --> A: Provide access to metadata fields
deactivate B

A -> B: Edit metadata fields
activate B
B --> C: Send updated metadata fields
activate C
C --> B: Confirm changes
deactivate C
B --> A: Confirm success of changes
deactivate B

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram explains the process of how a library staff member logs into the data repository system, requests to edit the metadata fields of a project, modifies the fields, and receives a confirmation that the changes were successful.

As PlantUML is a text-based language for drawing UML diagrams, this code can be copied into a PlantUML editor, and it will generate a visual representation of the sequence diagram. It also allows for easy modifications in the future. 


Please note that the sequence diagram assumes that:

- Staff members already have valid login credentials and are authorized to customize the metadata fields.
   
- The data repository system has all functionalities mentioned in the user story i.e. viewing metadata fields, editing metadata fields, and receive confirmation upon successful changes.

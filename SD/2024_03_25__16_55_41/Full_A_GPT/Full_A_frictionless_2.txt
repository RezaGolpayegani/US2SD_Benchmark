To generate a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format, we would need more low-level details about the sequence of actions performed in the tool. However, here's a broad sequence flow based on the given user story.

Please note that the diagram is in a textual format. You can use online PlantUML editor tools to create the visualization.
```
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant DataManager
participant PackageImporter

Researcher -> DataManager: request(dataPackage)
activate DataManager
DataManager -> PackageImporter: importRequest(dataPackage, "Julia")
activate PackageImporter

PackageImporter --> DataManager: isPackageImporting()
note over DataManager
DataManager checks if the data is being imported
end note
DataManager --> Researcher: isInProgress()

loop
    PackageImporter --> DataManager: isPackageImported()
    note over DataManager
    DataManager checks if the data is imported
    end note
    DataManager --> Researcher: isInProgress()
end

until PackageImporter --> DataManager: isPackageImported() is true

DataManager --> Researcher: importSuccess(dataPackage_in_Julia)
note over Researcher
Researcher can now start using the data for analysis and visualizations
end note

deactivate DataManager
deactivate PackageImporter

``` 

In this sequence diagram, the user "Researcher" requests a data package from the "DataManager". The "DataManager" then initiates an import request with the "PackageImporter", specifying the language as Julia. An iterative process then occurs until the data package is successfully imported into Julia. Once done, the DataManager responds to the Researcher that the import has been successful.

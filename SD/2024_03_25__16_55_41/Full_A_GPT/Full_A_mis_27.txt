As a language model AI, I am unable to provide drawings or diagrams directly. However, I can provide you with PlantUML sequence diagram code relating to the User Story:

```plantuml

title DigitalRecords Archivist Sequence Diagram

autonumber
actor DigitalRecordsArchivist alias Archivist
participant RepositorySystem alias System

Archivist->System: AddDepositorsToGroup(Id, Depositors)

System-->Archivist: AcknowledgeAddition(Id, Depositors)

Archivist->System: RemoveDepositorsFromGroup(Id, Depositors)

System-->Archivist: AcknowledgeRemoval(Id, Depositors)

System-->Archivist: AcknowledgeSetDate(CollectionId, Date)
deactivate System

Archivist->System: ConferPermissions(GroupId, Permissions)
activate System
System-->Archivist: AcknowledgePermissions(GroupId, Permissions)
deactivate System

```

Explanation of the sequence diagram:

1. Archivist makes a request to the Repository System to add depositors to a group by providing the group ID and a list of depositors.
2. The system acknowledges the addition of the depositors to the group.
3. Archivist then makes a request to the System to remove depositors from a group, again providing the group ID and list of depositors.
4. The system acknowledges the removal of the depositors from the group.
5. Archivist sets a close date for the deposit window in a specific collection by providing the collection ID and the close date.
6. The system acknowledges the setting of the deposit window close date.
7. Lastly, the Archivist makes a request to the System to confer specific permissions to a group by providing the group ID and the permissions.
8. The system acknowledges the conferral of permissions.

Please note that this is a simplified sequence diagram and does not consider all factors such as error handling or other intermediate processes that might be important in the actual system.

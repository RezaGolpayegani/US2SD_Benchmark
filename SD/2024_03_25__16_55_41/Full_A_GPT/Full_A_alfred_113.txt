Writing a sequence diagram for this specific user story in PlantUML format would look like this:

```
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant ALFRED
participant Game

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Request for a game
activate ALFRED
ALFRED -> Game: Find appropriate game
activate Game
Game --> ALFRED: Suggest game that combines mental and physical exercise
deactivate Game
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: Show game suggestion
deactivate ALFRED
OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Confirm game
activate ALFRED
ALFRED -> Game: Start game
activate Game
Game --> ALFRED: Game started
deactivate Game
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: Display game
deactivate ALFRED
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram represents the story of an older person requesting a game through ALFRED, who finds the appropriate game - a game requiring both mental and physical exercises such as opposing motion exercises of the arms and legs. Once the game is suggested and confirmed, ALFRED starts the game and displays it to the older person. 
Each arrow denotes a communication between the objects (participant, ALFRED and game). 'Activate' and 'deactivate' are used to show the time span where a class (participant) is active during the scenario.

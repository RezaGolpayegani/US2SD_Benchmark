Here's a basic rundown of how to generate a UML sequence diagram for commenting on books in PlantUML format.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Reader
entity "Library Management System" as system
database "Book Database" as database

Reader -> system : Access interface [Shows list of books]
system -> database : Get Books
database --> system : Return list of books
system --> Reader : Display books

Reader -> system : Selects a book [Comments on book]
system -> database : Retrieve book
database --> system : Send book details
system --> Reader : Display book and comments section

Reader -> system : Enter comment then submit
system -> database : Store comment to book
database --> system : Successfully stored
system --> Reader : Comment Successfully posted

Firstly, this suggests that the reader accesses the library management system interface. The system retrieves the books list from the Book Database. It then presents the books to the reader.

The reader then selects a book to comment on. The system retrieves the book details from the Book Database and presents these to the reader, showing the comments section for the selected book.

The reader enters their comment and submits it to the library system. The library management system then stores this comment in the Book Database. If the comment is successfully stored, the system confirms to the reader that their comment has been added.  

This is a simplified example and may need further refinement to fit your specific project requirements.

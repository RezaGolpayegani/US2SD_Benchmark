In the sequence diagram, we'll showcase the interactions between the Manager, System, Database, and the Waiter. The flow starts from the Manager (user) requesting to see the number of orders taken by each waiter on daily basis so that the manager can measure the performance of employees.

```plantuml

@startuml
actor Manager
participant System
database Database
participant Waiter

Manager -> System: Request to view orders by each waiter
activate System
System -> Database: Fetch order details
activate Database
Database --> System: Returns order details
deactivate Database
System --> Manager: Presents order details
deactivate System
@enduml

```

This sequence diagram illustrates a basic process. The Manager makes a request to the System to view the number of orders made by each Waiter every day. The System then fetches these order details from the Database. The Database returns the order details to the System, which in turn presents this information to the Manager.

For the sake of clarity, this sequence diagram does not account for error handling such as what happens if the system fails to retrieve the data from the database. If such sequences are needed or other conditions should be considered, the sequence diagram will need to be adjusted accordingly.

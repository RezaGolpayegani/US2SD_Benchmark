To design a detailed sequence diagram for the user story based on the project description given, we need multiple actors - Data Publishing User (DPU) and Platform Administrator (PA). The following is the corresponding Plant UML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor DPU
actor PA
boundary "GeoJSON Source"

DPU -> PA: Request to Add GeoJSON Source
PA -> DPU: Provide Criteria and Template for Source
DPU -> "GeoJSON Source": Choose and Validate Source based on Criteria
"GeoJSON Source" -> DPU: Confirm Validity of Source
DPU -> PA: Submit Validated Source for Approval
PA -> DPU: Approve or Reject Source
note right of PA: Approve or Reject based on thorough evaluation
DPU -> "GeoJSON Source": Update Source based on Approval
"GeoJSON Source" -> DPU: Confirm Update Source
DPU -> PA: Notify on Update Source 
PA -> DPU: Acknowledge Update

Please note, PlantUML sequence diagrams denote the flow of control across a system. Hence the above diagram depicts the flow of control when a data publishing user attempts to provide a platform administrator with additional GeoJSON sources. The arrows in the above diagram illustrate the request and response flow between the actors. Notes are used to provide additional context or explanation.

In order to create a sequence diagram for the user story, you should be familiar with basic PlantUML syntax.

Below is an example of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format that might fit the user story.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor DB_Administrator

DB_Administrator -> ReportService: requestReportSubscribers(reportID)
activate ReportService

ReportService ->  SubscriberDatabase: querySubscribers(reportID)
activate SubscriberDatabase

SubscriberDatabase --> ReportService: returnSubscriberList
deactivate SubscriberDatabase

ReportService --> DB_Administrator: returnSubscriberList
deactivate ReportService

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with a DB/IR administrator who interacts with a ReportService to requestReportSubscribers by providing reportID. 

The ReportService then interacts with the SubscriberDatabase to querySubscribers using the same reportID. The SubscriberDatabase returns the list of subscribers back to the ReportService.

Finally, the ReportService returns the list of subscribers to the DB/IR administrator.

Please adjust according to your exact needs and the details of your system.

Note: For the PlantUML diagram to be viewed, you need to have the PlantUML extension installed in your VS Code, Then copy the syntax and paste on your VS code, click on the preview button at the upper right corner to view the diagram.

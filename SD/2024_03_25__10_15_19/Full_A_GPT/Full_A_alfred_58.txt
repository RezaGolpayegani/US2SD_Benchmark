Here is a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Fall Detection and Emergency Contact by ALFRED

actor OlderPerson as P
participant "ALFRED Fall\nDetection System" as A
database "Emergency\nContact List" as E
participant "Specific Contact" as S

P -> A: Fall Detected
activate A
A -> E: Fetches emergency contact
activate E
E --> A: Returns emergency contact information
deactivate E
A -> S: Sends emergency alert
activate S
S --> A : Acknowledges receiving alert
deactivate S
deactivate A

@enduml
```

In this diagram:
- OlderPerson (P) signifies an older person who fell.
- ALFRED Fall Detection System (A) signifies the system that detects falls.
- Emergency Contact List (E) signifies the database which stores emergency contact information.
- Specific Contact (S) signifies the specific person whom ALFRED sends the emergency alert to.

The sequence is as follows:
- A fall is detected by the ALFRED Fall Detection System
- The system then fetches the emergency contact from the Emergency Contact List 
- The emergency contact information is returned to ALFRED
- The ALFRED system sends an emergency alert to the specific contact
- The specific contact acknowledges receiving the alert

Please modify this sequence as per your project specifics.

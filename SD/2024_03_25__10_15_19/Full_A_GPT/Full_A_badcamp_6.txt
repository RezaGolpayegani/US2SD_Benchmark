Here is a tentative sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Trainee
entity "Authentication System" as Auth
entity "Registration System" as Register

Trainee -> Auth : Login
Auth -> Trainee : Retrieve User ID

Trainee -> Register : Initiate Registration
activate Register
Register -> Auth : Check User ID & Time of Last Registration
Auth -> Register : Return Time of Last Registration

alt User last registered less than 24 hours ago
    Register -> Trainee: Restrict from Registering 
    deactivate Register
else User last registered more than 24 hours ago
    Register -> Trainee: Proceed Registration 
    deactivate Register
end
@enduml
```

Explanation :

- The trainee logs in the Authentication System which returns a User ID.
- The trainee initiates the registration. This activates the Registration System.
- The Registration system asks the Authentication system to retrieve last registration details for the user.
- If the user registered in less than 24 hours, the Registration System restricts new registration.
- If it was more than 24 hours ago, the Registration System proceeds with the registration. 

This is a basic diagram and lacks detail as the full system details are yet known, and can be updated once more details are available.

Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create visual contant or diagrams. However, I can provide you with a description of how you might structure your PlantUML sequence diagram based on the user story provided.

Before the diagram creation, let's outline the basic flow:

1. Employee chooses to add a new order.
2. The system prompts the employee to enter the necessary details related to the store order.
3. The employee fills in the details of the order.
4. The system validates the entered details of the order.
5. If the information is correct, the order is saved to the system.
6. The employee receives a confirmation that the order has been successfully saved.

Your PlantUML code would look somewhat like this (please adapt according to the actual interfaces and class names in your system):

```
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "Order System" as System

Employee -> System: Select Add Order
System -> Employee: Prompt Order Details
Employee -> System: Enter Order Details (Order Info)
System -> System: Validate Order Details
alt Order Information is Correct
    System -> System: Save Order
    System --> Employee: Confirmation Message
else Order Information is Incorrect 
    System --> Employee: Error Message
end
@enduml
```

This would create a sequence diagram showing the interaction between the Employee actor and the Order System while adding a store order. The condition for whether the order information is correct or not is represented by an alt frame.

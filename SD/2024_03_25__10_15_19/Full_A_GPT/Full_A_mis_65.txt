As a language model AI, I am unable to generate an actual image of a sequence diagram but I will try to give you a template that you can use to create it with PlantUML. You can modify the actors and actions according to your specific needs.

Let's assume you have 3 actors: User (repository manager), GUI (staff interface), and the System (version server where versions are stored).

```puml
@startuml
participant "User" as U
participant "GUI" as G
participant "System" as S

U -> G : Request to view available versions
activate G
G -> S : Get versions list
activate S
S -->> G : Return versions list
deactivate S
G -->> U : display Versions
deactivate G

U -> G : Select a version to restore
activate G
G -> S : Send restore version request
activate S
S -->> G : Restore operation status
deactivate S
G -->> U : Display restore result
deactivate G
@enduml

```

1. The user requests to view available versions from the GUI (staff interface).
2. GUI sends a request to the System to get the list of versions.
3. The system returns the list of versions to the GUI.
4. GUI displays the list of versions to the User.
5. The user selects a version from the displayed list that they wish to restore.
6. GUI sends a request to the System to restore the selected version.
7. The system restores the selected version and returns the operation status to the GUI.
8. GUI displays the result of the restore operation to the User.

Please note that the Plant UML format must be used in a Plant UML editor or viewer to see the drawn sequence diagram.

Here is the sequence diagram in Plant UML code:

```
@startuml
participant "Member" as M
participant "System" as S
database "Database" as DB

M->S: Request to view members' comments
activate S
S->DB: Queries member comments
activate DB
DB-->S: Returns queried comments
deactivate DB
S->M: Display members' comments
deactivate S
@enduml
```

Explanation: 

1. The member makes a request to the system to view other members' comments. 
2. The system then makes a query to the database to retrieve these comments.
3. The database returns the queried comments back to the system. 
4. The system then displays these comments to the requesting member. 

Note: The above code generates a simple interaction diagram. Deploy this code in any UML diagram tool that supports PlantUML to visualize the sequence.

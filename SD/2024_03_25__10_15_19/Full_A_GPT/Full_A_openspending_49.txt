In order to create a sequence diagram for the User Story described, the following Plant UML format can be used:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Data Consuming User" as user
participant "Search Interface" as search
participant "Database" as db
participant "Dataset" as dataset

user -> search : Enter Search Terms
activate search

search -> db: Query Search Terms
activate db

db -> db: Search Database
note right: Search involves dataset title and metadata

db -> search: Return Matching Data
destroy db

search -> user: Display Results
destroy search

user -> dataset: Select Dataset
activate dataset

dataset -> user: Provide Dataset Access
destroy dataset

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
- The "Data Consuming User" initiates the sequence by entering their desired search terms into a "Search Interface".
- The terms are then queried in a "Database" where the search takes place, using the dataset title and metadata.
- The matching data are returned to the "Search Interface", which then displays these results to the User.
- The User then selects a desired "Dataset" from the results, and the system provides access for the User to this dataset.

Please note that this is a very high level sequence diagram which may need to be modified according to your application's business rules and specific architecture.

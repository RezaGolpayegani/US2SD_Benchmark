Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for a user story requires an understanding of the steps (actions and interactions) involved within the scenario. However, since the project description is undefined, here's a general illustration for the provided user story:

 ```
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

M -> S: Request to view remaining items
activate S
S -> D: Retrieve remaining items
activate D
D --> S: Return items info
deactivate D
S --> M: Show remaining items
deactivate S
@enduml
```

1. The User (Manager) makes a request to the System to view remaining items.
2. The System, upon receiving the request, retrieves the data from the Database.
3. The Database returns the info related to the items.
4. The System presents (shows) the remaining items to the User (Manager).

Please revise it according to your real case scenario and elements interaction.

Note: This is a basic example and, in a complete system, more elements and interactions are supposed to exist. Also, the way how the system retrieves and presents the items can significantly change the diagram.

Note: Use this Plant UML code in a Plant UML compiler to generate corresponding sequence diagram.

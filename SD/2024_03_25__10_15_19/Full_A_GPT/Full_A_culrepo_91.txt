Unfortunately, as an AI text model, I can't directly generate a visual sequence diagram. However, I can provide you a textual representation of how to create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for your user story.

Let's consider the actions of a DB/IR administrator along with the system and Calendar service as described in your User Story:

`User Story: As a DB/IR administrator, I want to add future release dates of reports/datasets to calendar for patron FYI.`

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "DB/IR Administrator" as admin
participant "System" as system
participant "Calendar Service" as calendar

admin -> system : Add future release date
activate system
system -> calendar : Request add date
activate calendar
calendar --> system : Confirm date added
deactivate calendar
system --> admin : Show confirmation
deactivate system

@enduml
```

In this sequence, the DB/IR Administrator initiates the process by adding a future release date of a report or dataset. This request is sent to the System, which in turn sends a request to the Calendar Service to add the date. The Calendar Service then confirms that the date has been added, and this confirmation is passed back to the System, which finally displays a confirmation to the DB/IR Administrator. 

Please copy and paste the given PlantUML code in an offline PlantUML editor or an online tool such as http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml to visualize the Sequence Diagram. Adaptations may be necessary depending on the specific technologies or processes in your project.

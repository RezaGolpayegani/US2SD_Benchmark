The User Story is not detailed enough for the generation of Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format. Also, note that creating a sequence diagram for the provided user story would be challenging, as the user story doesn't involve any interaction scenario, but rather a need or desire in a physical product. Sequence Diagrams are more relevant for representing interactions between software components, not physical characteristics of a product.

A User Story that adapts better to Sequence Diagram could be: as an OlderPerson, I want to order ALFRED shirt through the online store so that it can be delivered to my house.

A User Story like this allows the crafting of a sequence diagram that involves actors (OlderPerson, Online Store System), and interactions (choosing a product, adding to the cart, checking out, etc).

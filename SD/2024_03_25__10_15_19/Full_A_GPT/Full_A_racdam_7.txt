Here is a sequence diagram that detailing the process which an archivist goes through to add a restriction end date to files:

```
@startuml

actor Archivist as A
entity "File Management System" as FMS

A --> FMS : Accesses system
FMS --> FMS : Verifies user and privileges
FMS --> A : Provides access to files

A --> FMS : Selects file to apply restriction
FMS --> FMS : Checks if file already has a restriction
FMS --> A : Alerts if file already has restriction

A --> FMS : Applies restriction end date to file
FMS --> FMS : Saves restriction end date info to the file

FMS --> A : Confirms successful saving of restriction

A --> FMS : Exits system

@enduml
```

This diagram begins with the archivist accessing the File Management System. The system verifies the user and their system privileges, then allows the archivist access to the files. The archivist selects a file to apply a restriction to; the system checks if this file already has a restriction and alerts the archivist if it does. The archivist then applies a restriction end date to the file, which the system saves. The system confirms that this save was successful, and the archivist then exits the system.

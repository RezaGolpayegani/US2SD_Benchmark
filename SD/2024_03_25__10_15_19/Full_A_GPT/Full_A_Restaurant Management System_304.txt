Here is a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the User Story "As a waiter, I want to see the orders."

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Waiter" as W
participant "Order Management System" as O
participant "Database" as D

W -> O : Request to view orders
activate O
O -> D : Retrieve all orders
activate D
D --> O : Return order data
deactivate D
O --> W : Display order data
deactivate O

@enduml
```

Explanation:

1. The waiter sends a request to the Order Management System to view all orders.
2. The Order Management System receives the request and retrieves all data from the Database.
3. The Database returns all order data to the Order Management System.
4. Finally, the Order Management System displays all order data to the waiter.

Given that PlantUML sequence diagrams cannot be generated directly in text and require a specific format of coding that cannot be presented here, I will provide you with the logic to create the sequence diagram using PlantUML for the given user story.

1. Waiter initiates the software or system to retrieve the menu. This could be represented in PlantUML Format as "Waiter --> System: Request  Menu."

2. The system processes the request and retrieves the menu data from the storage/database. In PlantUML, we represent this as "System --> Database: Retrieve Menu."

3. The database responds and sends the menu data back to the system. The response is sent back as "Database --> System: Respond with Menu Data."

4. The system then forwards or displays the menu data to the waiter. This is specified as "System --> Waiter: Display Menu."

The final code in PlantUML format could look like this:

@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "System" as A
database "Database" as B

Waiter --> A: Request Menu
A --> B: Retrieve Menu
B --> A: Respond with Menu Data
A --> Waiter: Display Menu
@enduml

You can put this in a PlantUML editor, and it will generate a suitable sequence diagram for the scenario. Please note that above code is only a basic sample and actual code could differ based on the complexity of your system. 

In any case, you have to use a software or online tool which supports PlantUML to generate the graphical sequence diagram.

Note: The system interface will depend on the specifics of your system and could be a POS device, software interface, or another method for accessing the system.

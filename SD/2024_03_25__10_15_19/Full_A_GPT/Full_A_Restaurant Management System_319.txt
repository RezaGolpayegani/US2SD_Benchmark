Sure, here's a basic step-by-step breakdown for this sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter

box "Restaurant System"
participant MenuSystem
end box

Waiter -> MenuSystem: Request Menu
MenuSystem -> MenuSystem: Retrieve Menu
MenuSystem --> Waiter: Display Menu
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the `Waiter` who interacts with the `MenuSystem` within a bounded context called `Restaurant System`. The `Waiter` sends a Request to view the `Menu`. Then, the `MenuSystem` retrieves the `Menu` data (This could involve a query to a database or any other source of information about the Menu). Once the `Menu` data has been retrieved, it's displayed back to the `Waiter`.

Please modify it based on specific actions and actors related to your project.

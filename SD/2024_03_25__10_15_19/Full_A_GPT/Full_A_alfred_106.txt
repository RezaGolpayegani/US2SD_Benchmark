This project description does not provide specific functionalities or the operation process; however, I'll take the liberty to assume some typical processes in designing this sequence diagram in Plant UML format.

```
@startuml
title Health Tip Application Sequence Diagram
participant Client as A
participant Server as B
participant Database as C

box "Client Side" #LightBlue
  participant "Older Person" as D
end box

box "Server Side" #LightYellow
  participant "Health Tips Generator" as E
end box

box "Database" #LightGreen
  participant "Health Tips for Elderly Database" as F
end box

note right of A
  An older person interacts 
  with the client. 
end note

A -> B : Request to view health tips
activate B
note right of B
  Server processes 
  the request. 
end note

B -> C : Fetch health tips data
activate C
note right of C
  Database fetches 
  health tips. 
end note

C --> B : Returns health tips data
note right of B
  Server receives 
  health tips data. 
end note
B --> A : Sends back health tips data
note right of A
  Client receives the
  health tips.
end note

D -> E : Sends health issue details
E -> F : Fetches specific health tips
F --> E : Returns specific health tips
E --> D : Sends specific tips to reduce health impairments without medication
note right of D
  Older Person receives
  personalized health tips. 
end note

deactivate B
deactivate C

This is a hypothetical sequence diagram based on the User Story. It represents a scenario where an OlderPerson fetches specific health tips to reduce health impairments without using medications. Assumed processes include health tips fetch from a server that interacts with a database to generate specific health tips.

To create a detailed sequence diagram, we need to identify the key objects (actors) and their interactions for this user story. The actors likely include the `Researcher`, `LogBook`, and `System`.

Here is a suggested sequence in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant System
participant LogBook

Researcher -> System: RequestPageCreation()
activate System
System --> Researcher: ProvidePageDetails()
Researcher -> System: InputPageDetails()
System -> LogBook: CreatePage()
note over LogBook: Page created

Researcher -> System: RequestAttachment()
System --> Researcher: ProvideAttachmentDetails()
Researcher -> System: InputAttachmentDetails()
System -> LogBook: AttachFile()
note over LogBook: File attached
LogBook -> System: AcknowledgeAction()
System --> Researcher: ConfirmAction()
deactivate System
@enduml
```

This diagram shows the sequence of interactions for the given user story. The researcher initiates page creation and file attachment requests, to which the system provides the necessary details prompts. After receiving details from the researcher, the system interacts with the LogBook to create the page and attach the file. Once the actions have been completed, the system acknowledges the actions and confirms with the researcher. 

You should customize your actual diagram as per the specifics of your project or system.

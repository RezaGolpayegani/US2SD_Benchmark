As an AI, I am unable to provide visual content, including UML diagrams. However, I can suggest a sequence of how this operation could take place using Plant UML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Data Librarian" as D
participant "DMP" as DMP
participant "Other Systems" as O
participant "Data Catalogue" as DC

D -> DMP: Request pointers to metadata
activate DMP
DMP -> O: Retrieve metadata
activate O
O -> DMP: Return metadata
deactivate O
DMP -> D: Return pointers to metadata
deactivate DMP
D -> DC: Import metadata
activate DC
DC -> D: Confirm import 
deactivate DC

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The `Data Librarian` requests pointers to metadata from the `DMP` (Data Management Platform).
2. The `DMP` retrieves these metadata from `Other Systems`.
3. The `Other Systems` return the metadata to the `DMP`.
4. The `DMP` sends the pointers to the metadata to the `Data Librarian`.
5. The `Data Librarian` imports the metadata into the `Data Catalogue`.
6. The `Data Catalogue` confirms imported data to the `Data Librarian`.

This represents the User's story based on your project description. You can represent this flow in a sequence diagram format using any UML tool that supports Plant UML syntax.

I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and I'm unable to create visual diagrams directly. However, I can provide you the necessary code in PlantUML format which you can render in any PlantUML editor or online viewer.

Here is a simple sequence diagram for your user story:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "OrderSystem" as OS
database "Database" as DB

Employee -> OS: Enter note to Order
activate OS
OS -> DB: Save note to Order
activate DB
DB --> OS: Confirm save
deactivate DB
OS --> Employee: Confirm note entry
deactivate OS

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the following steps:
1. "Employee" sends a request to "OrderSystem" to enter a note to an order.
2. The "OrderSystem" processes the request and gives a command to the "Database" to save the note to the order.
3. The "Database" confirms the saving process and sends a confirmation to the "OrderSystem".
4. The "OrderSystem" confirms the note entry to the "Employee".

Please note some details could vary depending on the specifics of your project.

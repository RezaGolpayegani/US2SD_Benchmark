Here is a suggested detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the given user story. Given the complexity of designing a gaming platform and the limited information, the diagram pares down the process into key steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "OlderPerson" as A
participant "GameApp" as B
participant "HealthAnalyzer" as C

A -> B : Opens Game APP
activate B
B -> B : Display Games List
B -> A : Sends Games List
A -> B : Selects Memory Game
note right: More types of games could be added.
B -> C : Request Health Analyze
activate C
C -> C : Analyze Memory Stats
C -> B : Returns Memory Stats
deactivate C
B -> B : Load Game according to stat
B -> A : Display Game Interface
A -> B : Starts Playing
note right: The actual game could vary considerably, but will offer a good measure of memory skills.
B -> C : Monitors User Activity
activate C
C -> C : Analyze User Performance
C -> B : Sends Performance Report
deactivate C
B -> A : Shows Performance Report
deactivate B
@enduml
```

To better understand this diagram:

- "OlderPerson" interacts with the "GameApp" by selecting a game.
- The "GameApp" then requests the "HealthAnalyzer" to analyze the person's memory stats.
- Based on the results, the game loads suitably.
- As the user plays the game, their activity is monitored and a performance report is generated and shown to the user.

Please adjust this diagram as needed to fit the specifics of the development project.

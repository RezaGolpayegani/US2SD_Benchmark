Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for your user story: 

```
@startuml
title OlderPerson Uses ALFRED to Learn About Art Expositions/museums

actor OlderPerson as OP
participant "ALFRED" as ALFRED
participant "Art Expositions/Museum Info Profiler" as AEMP
database "Art Expositions/Museum Database" as AED

OP -> ALFRED : Request(art expositions/museum information)
activate ALFRED
ALFRED -> AEMP : GetUnseenExpositions /MuseumInformation(OP)
activate AEMP

AEMP -> AED : FetchUnseenExpositions /MuseumInformation(OP)
activate AED
AED --> AEMP : ArtExpositions/MuseumInformation
deactivate AED

AEMP --> ALFRED : ArtExpositions /MuseumInformation
deactivate AEMP
ALFRED -> OP : Provide(ArtExpositions/MuseumInformation)

deactivate ALFRED

Here is the explanation of the diagram:

1. The OlderPerson (OP) starts by sending a request for art expositions or museums information.
2. ALFRED gets activated and requests unseen expositions/museum information related to an older person's profile from Art Expositions/Museum Info Profiler (AEMP).
3. AEMP activates and requests previously unseen expositions or museums from the Art Expositions/Museum Database (AED).
4. Once Database fetches the expositions/museum information, it sends this information back to the AEMP.
5. AEMP then sends this information to ALFRED.
6. As a result, ALFRED provides the fetched information to the OlderPerson. 

This sequence diagram outlines interactions involved when an OlderPerson uses the ALFRED system to learn about art expositions or a museum. Adjustments might be required based on the actual services and the kind of interactions ALFRED has with its database and profiling system.

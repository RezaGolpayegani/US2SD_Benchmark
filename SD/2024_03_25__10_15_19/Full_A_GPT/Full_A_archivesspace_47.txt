This is a sequence diagram representing a series of interactions between objects (Repository Manager, Repository Service, and Database) for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "Repository Service" as RS
database "Database" as DB

RM -> RS: createRecord(recordData)
activate RS
RS -> DB: insert(recordData)
activate DB
DB --> RS: AcknowledgeRecordCreation
deactivate DB
RS --> RM: RecordCreationSuccessMessage
deactivate RS

RM -> RS: updateRecord(recordId, newRecordData)
activate RS
RS -> DB: modify(recordId, newRecordData)
activate DB
DB --> RS: AcknowledgeRecordUpdate
deactivate DB
RS --> RM: RecordUpdateSuccessMessage
deactivate RS

RM -> RS: deleteRecord(recordId)
activate RS
RS -> DB: remove(recordId)
activate DB
DB --> RS: AcknowledgeRecordDeletion
deactivate DB
RS --> RM: RecordDeletionSuccessMessage
deactivate RS

The sequence diagram shows the Repository Manager interacting with the Repository Service to create, update and delete records in the database. Note, however, the sequence diagram does not show error-cases nor data validation, which would be important for a complete design.

Regarding the Plant UML format, it's important to highlight that you will need a Plant UML viewer to visualize this diagram. The above text generates the diagram by describing the sequence of operations.

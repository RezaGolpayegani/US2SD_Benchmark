Creating a detailed sequence diagram based on the user story is a bit challenging without additional information about the specific architecture and requirements of the system. Nevertheless, I can provide a basic framework in PlantUML format that may work from a very general standpoint.

Below is an example of how you might structure a sequence diagram based on the user story:

```
@startuml
title Add Data in Bulk to Datastore

actor "Data Publishing User" as user
boundary "Command Line Interface" as cli
participant "Python Client" as client
database "Datastore" as datastore

user -> cli : Input command & data in bulk
activate cli
cli -> client : Pass command & data
activate client
client -> datastore : ADD data in bulk
activate datastore
datastore --> client : Acknowledge upload
deactivate datastore
client --> cli : Return upload status
deactivate client
cli --> user : Show upload status message
deactivate cli
@enduml
```

This diagram means that the user inputs a command and data in bulk via a command line interface. The Python client then takes the command and the data and sends them to the datastore to be added. The datastore sends back an acknowledgment of the upload, which the Python client passes back to the command line interface and, finally, the user.

Please note that this is a very basic diagram for understanding purposes and it may differ based on your actual operation and system architecture. Also due to technical limitations, this textual description might not create an actual visual diagram - PlantUML software or plugin is required to transform the given code into a sequence diagram.

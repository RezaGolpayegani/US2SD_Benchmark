To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a reader, I want to comment on books", we can start by listing the relevant objects that would interact with each other based on the user story. These could include the Reader (User), Book, CommentSection, and Database.

Here is an example of how you might generate the diagram:

```uml
@startuml
participant "Reader (User)" as R
participant "Book" as B
participant "CommentSection" as CS
participant "Database" as DB

R -> B : Select Book
activate B
B -> CS : Open Comment Section
activate CS

R -> CS : Write Comment
CS -> CS : Check Validity of Comment

alt Comment Valid
    CS -> DB : Save Comment to Database
    activate DB
    DB --> CS : Confirmation of Saved Comment
    deactivate DB
    CS --> R : Show Success Message
else Comment Invalid
    CS --> R : Show Error Message
end

deactivate CS
deactivate B
@enduml
```

In this scenario, the reader selects a book, the book then opens the comment section. The reader writes a comment, the comment section checks the validity of the comment. If the comment is valid, it is saved to the database and a success message is shown. If not, an error message is displayed.

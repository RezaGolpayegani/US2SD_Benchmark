Plant UML can't be shared here because of its syntax formatting, but I will give you an example of how you can create a sequence diagram for the described user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
title User Orders Report

actor Manager
boundary "Order System UI" as UI
control "Order Report Controller" as C
entity "Order Database" as DB
note over Manager, DB: User Story goes here.

Manager -> UI: Request to view reports
activate UI
UI -> C: Calls the method get_reports()
activate C

C -> DB: Fetch the customer orders
activate DB
DB --> C: Return the orders
deactivate DB

C --> UI: Returns the reports
deactivate C

UI --> Manager: Show the reports
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

Description:

1. The manager interacts with the Order System UI to request a view of the reports.
2. The UI calls the `get_reports()` method of the Order Report Controller.
3. The Order Report Controller fetches the customer orders from the Order Database.
4. The Order Database returns the found orders back to the Order Report Controller.
5. The Order Report Controller returns as a response the customer orders to the Order System UI.
6. The UI then displays these reports to the Manager.

This diagram represents the flow of data and the interactions between different elements of the system in response to the Manager's desire to view reports on customer orders. You can further extend this diagram based on your needs, like for pinpointing recurring orders, etc. The diagram can be visualized using a Plant UML viewer.

As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I am unable to draw diagrams. However, I can provide you a basic script that you could use to generate a sequence diagram for your user story,based on which you can definitely make modifications according to your project's need.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Suggestions Sequence Diagram

actor Member

box "System"
    participant "Suggestions System"
end box

activate Member
Member -> "Suggestions System" : Request Suggestions
activate "Suggestions System"

"Suggestions System" -> Member : Display Suggestions

deactivate "Suggestions System"

@enduml
```

This script represents a sequence in which a user (referred to here as 'Member') interacts with a suggestions system. The member requests suggestions from the system, which then returns and displays these suggestions. All of this takes place within the same 'System' context.

You can copy this code into any PlantUML editor or you can use online editors like www.planttext.com to generate the sequence diagram.

Remember to modify the diagram code according to your detailed project needs and requirements, as this is just a basic one.

Please note that in sequence diagrams, you should focus on illustrating the interactive behavior of the system, rather than the details of implementing the user story.

Unfortunately, I am an AI text-based model and I am unable to directly create visual diagrams. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to create a sequence diagram in Plant UML for your specific user story. 

Based on your project description, hereâ€™s the raw PlantUML script that models the sequence diagram for the given user story:

```PlantUML
@startuml

actor "Restaurant Employee" as E
database "Database" as DB
entity "Order Management System" as OMS

E -> OMS: Request to view all active orders 
OMS -> DB: Fetch active orders
DB -> DB: Sort orders by order start date
DB --> OMS: Return sorted active orders
OMS --> E: Display all active orders

@enduml
```

In this scenario:

1. The "Restaurant Employee" makes a request to the "Order Management System" to view all active orders.
2. The "Order Management System" then makes a request to the "Database" to fetch all active orders.
3. The "Database" sorts these orders by the start date.
4. The sorted orders are then returned to the "Order Management System".
5. The "Order Management System" then displays all the active orders to the "Restaurant Employee".

Please note, you have to use a PlantUML editor or an IDE with PlantUML support to generate the visual diagram from this script.

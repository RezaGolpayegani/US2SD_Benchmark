Below is a sample representation of a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the given user story that could be refined as per specific requirements.

```

autonumber

actor Supervisor
entity "Researcher Management System" as System
database "Researcher Data Logs" as Logs

Supervisor -> System: Request list of researchers

System -> Logs: Query researcher list
activate Logs
Logs --> System: Returns list of researchers
deactivate Logs
System --> Supervisor: Show list of researchers
deactivate System

Supervisor -> System: Select a researcher
activate System
Supervisor -> System: Set date or period of time
System -> Logs: Query logs for selected researcher and date/time period

The above diagram includes an "Actor" entity named "Supervisor" who interacts with a "System" called the "Researcher Management System". This system further interacts with a "Database" named "Researcher Data Logs". In this scenario, the steps follow the process of the supervisor requesting a list of researchers, selecting a researcher, setting a date or period of time, then viewing the logged activities of the researcher during the specified period.

Sure, Here's a detailed sequence diagram depicted in PlantUML language for your user story :

```
@startuml
title Assign a Book to Unique Identification Number

actor LibraryManager
entity Database
entity UIDGenerator

LibraryManager -> UIDGenerator : Generate Unique ID
activate UIDGenerator
UIDGenerator --> LibraryManager : Return Unique ID
deactivate UIDGenerator

LibraryManager -> Database : Store/Update Book data with Unique ID
activate Database
Database --> LibraryManager : Confirm Book data Stored/Updated with Unique ID
deactivate Database   
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram contains three entities: the `LibraryManager`, `Database`, and `UIDGenerator` (Unique ID generator). 

Here's a step-by-step rundown:

- LibraryManager triggers the process by asking UIDGenerator to create a unique ID.
- UIDGenerator generates this unique ID and passes it back to LibraryManager.
- LibraryManager then contacts Database to store or update a book's data along with the newly generated unique ID.
- Database completes the operation and confirms the success of the operation to LibraryManager.

You can convert this PlantUML code to a visual diagram with an online or local PlantUML compiler.

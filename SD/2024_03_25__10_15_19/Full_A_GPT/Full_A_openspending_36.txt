As an AI model, I can't directly create a diagram but I can certainly provide you with the specifics on how to generate a sequence diagram using the PlantUML syntax. 

```puml

@startuml
participant "API User" as A
participant "API" as B
participant "Database" as C

A -> B: Send normalize request
activate B
B -> C: Retrieve measures and GDP data
activate C
C --> B: Return measures and GDP data
deactivate C
B -> B: Normalise measures by GDP
B --> A: Return normalized measures data
deactivate B
@enduml

```

The above script will create a sequence diagram where:

1. The API User sends a request to the API to normalize certain measures according to GDP.
2. The API contacts a database to retrieve both the measures and GDP data.
3. The database sends this data back to the API.
4. The API normalizes the measures by the GDP and returns the resulting data back to the API User. 

Process it either by any PlantUML rendering engine available online or via a local setup. Make sure to adjust according to your specific technology stack or any further detailed steps you might have.

Here is a simple Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format that represents the user story given:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Read Article as a Visitor Sequence Flow

actor Visitor

boundary "Web Browser" as WB
control "Web Server" as WS
entity "Article Database" as DB

Visitor -> WB: Request for Article
WB -> WS: HTTP: GET /articles/{articleID}
WS -> DB: Query for Article
DB -- WS: Return Article
WS -- WB: HTTP: 200 OK \n Content: Article
WB -- Visitor: Display Article
@enduml
```
This diagram depicts the following sequence of events:
1. Visitor makes a request for a specific article through the web browser
2. Web Browser sends a `GET` request to the web server to retrieve the specific article
3. Web Server queries the article database to get the content of the article.
4. Article Database returns the content of the article to the web server
5. Web Server sends HTTP Response `OK 200` (successful) along with the content back to the Web Browser.
6. Web Browser displays the content of the article to the visitor.

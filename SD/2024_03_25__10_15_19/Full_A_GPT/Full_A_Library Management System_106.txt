I'm an AI model and I'm unable to directly generate graphical diagrams. However, I can provide a textual example of how you might structure your PlantUML code to generate a sequence diagram for the user story. 

Here's an example of PlantUML code to create a sequence diagram that represents the flow of updating book information:

```puml
@startuml
title Update Book Information Sequence Diagram

"Librarian" as librarian
"Book Info System" as system
"Database" as db

librarian -> system : Update Book Info
activate system

system -> db : Send New Book Info
activate db

db --> system : Confirm Update
deactivate db

system --> librarian: Show Update Confirmation
deactivate system
@enduml
```

In this flow, the librarian sends a request to update book information to the system. The system sends the new book info to the database. The database then confirms the update to the system, and the system shows the update confirmation to the librarian.

Please remember this is a simplified flow. Real-world applications may involve additional steps and interactions, like input validation, exception handling, etc. 

Also, the PlantUML syntax used produces a basic representation, additional parameters may be required for a more detailed representation.

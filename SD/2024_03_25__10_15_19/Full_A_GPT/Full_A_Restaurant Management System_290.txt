Here's a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
title "Enter Order Details by Waiter"

actor Waiter
entity OrderSystem

Waiter -> OrderSystem: Input Order Details
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> OrderSystem: Verify/Validate Details
OrderSystem --> Waiter: Confirm Order Details
deactivate OrderSystem

@enduml
```
This diagram describes the basic interaction between a waiter and an order system. It begins with the waiter entering the order details into the system. The system then verifies or validates the details entered. Once that process is complete, the system confirms the order details to the waiter. 

Please adjust it according to the specific steps and behaviours in your application as PlantUML supports a wide variety of diagram specifications.

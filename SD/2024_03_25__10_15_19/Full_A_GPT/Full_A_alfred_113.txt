Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for a User Story requires a deep understanding of the specific operations, procedures, and system behavior. However, since the user story is quite general and doesn't specify system's functionality, it's impossible to create a sequence diagram. Here is a try to provide a rough idea of how it might be in PlantUML:

```
@startuml
title Game for Older Person

actor OlderPerson as P
boundary "Exercise Game System" as EGS
control "Game Controller" as GC
entity "Motion Sensor" as MS

P -> EGS: Request to start game
EGS -> GC: Initiate game start
GC -> MS: Activate motion sensor
MS --> GC: Motion data
GC --> EGS: Process game logic
EGS --> P: Game feedback & progress

@enduml
```
This diagram describes the sequence of operations:
1. An older person requests to start the game.
2. The game system initiates the game start
3. The game controller activates the motion sensor.
4. The motion sensor sends the motion data to the game controller.
5. The game controller processes the game logic and sends it to the game system.
6. The game system sends game feedback and progress to the older person.

Please provide specific details about the system functionality for an accurate Sequence Diagram.

This is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format representing the interaction between the Manager(user), System, and Database when the manager wants to track new books added to the collection monthly.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as A
participant System as B
participant Database as C

A -> B: Request book addition report (monthly)
activate B
B -> C: Retrieve book addition data (monthly)
activate C
C -->> B: Return book addition data
deactivate C
B -->> A: Display book addition report
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the manager requesting the monthly book addition report from the system. Then the system retrieves this data from the database. The database then returns the required data to the system. The data is displayed to the manager in the form of a report, making it easy for them to track the new books added to the library collection.

You can take this code and put it into a Plant UML editor to generate the related sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Owner
participant "Data Publishing\nPlatform" as Platform
participant Member

Owner -> Platform : Initiate Invite
activate Platform
Platform -> Owner : Request Member's Email
Owner --> Platform : Provide Member's Email
Platform -> Member : Send Invitation via Email
deactivate Platform
activate Member
Member --> Platform : Accept Invitation
Platform -> Member : Direct to Sign up via GitHub or Google
Member --> Platform: Sign up and Become Member
deactivate Member
Platform -> Owner : Notify about New Member
@enduml
```

This UML sequence script details the interactions between the owner(owner who invites someone), the data publishing platform and the future member(person who gets invited). The owner initiates inviting someone to the platform. The platform requests for the future member's email. After the owner provides the email, the platform sends an invitation to the future member. The member then accepts the invitation, signs up via either GitHub or Google and hence becomes a member. The platform then notifies the owner about the new member.

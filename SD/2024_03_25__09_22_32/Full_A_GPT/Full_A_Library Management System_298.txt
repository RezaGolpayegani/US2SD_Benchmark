Plant UML does not support text input hence I can't provide you with UML diagram, however, I can provide the sequential steps to create the diagram.

Creating a diagram for this user story in Plant UML format would look like the following sequence:
```plantuml
@startuml
Actor Member
Participant "System"

Member -> System : Request Due Date of Book
activate System
System -> Database : Fetch Due Date for Borrowed Book
activate Database
Database -> System : Return Due Date
deactivate Database
System -> Member : Show Due Date
deactivate System
@enduml 
```
The above sequence has these steps:
1. Member requests the due date of a book from the system
2. The System fetches the due date for the borrowed book from the Database
3. The Database returns the due date to the system
4. System shows the due date to the member.

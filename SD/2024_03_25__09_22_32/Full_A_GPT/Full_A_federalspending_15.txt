Generating a sequence diagram in the Plant UML format for the above description would be difficult since it requires visual elements, but here is a sample code for a sequence diagram involving the user story.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Owner"

participant "System"

participant "USAspending"

Owner -> System : Request Grant Records

activate System

System -> USAspending : Fetch Grant Records

activate USAspending

USAspending --> System : Send Grant Records

deactivate USAspending

System --> Owner : Display Grant Records

deactivate System

@enduml
```

Given in this sequence diagram, the Owner sends a request for grant records to the System. The system then requests these records from USAspending. USAspending sends the grant records back to the system, which then displays these records to the owner.

For more complex interactions or additional processes, you would need to add more participants and interactions to this basic setup.

Of course, this is a simplified approach. Depending on the real processes and how the data flows through your system, your sequence diagram might look quite different.

Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to generate graphical content like UML diagrams. However, I can provide a textual description of how your sequence diagram could be set up in the PlantUML format:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
box "Repository System" #LightYellow
  participant "Database System" as DS
  participant "User Interface(UI)" as UI
end box

RM -> UI: Start Application
UI -> DS: Fetch all records
DS --> UI: Return fetched records
UI --> RM: Display all records

== Record Creation Sequence ==
RM -> UI: Initiate Create New Record
UI -> DS: Send Create New Record Request
DS --> UI: New Record Created Confirmation
UI --> RM: Display confirmation message

== Record Update Sequence ==
RM -> UI: Initiate Update Existing Record
UI -> DS: Send Update Existing Record Request
DS --> UI: Updated Record Confirmation
UI --> RM: Display confirmation message

== Record Deletion Sequence ==
RM -> UI: Initiate Delete Existing Record
UI -> DS: Send Delete Existing Record Request
DS --> UI: Deleted Record Confirmation
UI --> RM: Display confirmation message

This text gives a basic sequence diagram that shows the Repository Manager interacting with the User Interface to Create, Update, and Delete records in the database system. Note that all interactions are initiated by the Repository Manager.

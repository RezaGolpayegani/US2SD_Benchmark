Here is an example of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
actor Faculty
database Repository
entity Publication

Faculty -> Repository: RequestUploadData
activate Repository
Repository --> Faculty: ProvideUploadForm
deactivate Repository
activate Faculty
Faculty -> Repository: SubmitData
deactivate Faculty
activate Repository
Repository -> Publication: AssociateDataWithPublication
activate Publication
Publication --> Repository: ConfirmAssociation
deactivate Publication
Repository --> Faculty: ConfirmDataUploadAndAssociation
deactivate Repository
@enduml
```
In this sequence diagram:
1. `Faculty` initiates the process by requesting to upload data to the `Repository`.
2. The `Repository` then provides the upload form to the `Faculty`.
3. The `Faculty` submits the data using the form to the `Repository`.
4. The `Repository` then sends a request to `Publication` to associate the data with a specific publication.
5. `Publication` confirms the association back to the `Repository`.
6. Finally, the `Repository` confirms the successful data upload and association back to the `Faculty`.

The "activate" and "deactivate" statements are used to demonstrate the commencement and completion of each act by the different parties involved in the process.

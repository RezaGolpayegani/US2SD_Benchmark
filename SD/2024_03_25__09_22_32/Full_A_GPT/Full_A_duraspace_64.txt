Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram for a simplified version of this user story:

```
@startuml
participant "RepositoryManager" as A
participant "CollectionComponent" as B
participant "ObjectComponent" as C
participant "OtherEntities" as D
A -> B : View Collection Details
Activate B
B -->> A : Collection Data
Deactivate B
A -> C : View Object Details
Activate C
C -->> A : Object Data
Deactivate C
A -> B : Describe non-addressable facets
Activate B
B -> D : Fetch additional information
activate D
D -->> B : Additional Data
B -->> A : Return all data
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram represents the flow of operation described in the user story. "RepositoryManager" requests for collection and object details. Each of these steps could involve communicating with separate components ("CollectionComponent" and "ObjectComponent").

To describe non-addressable facets of a collection, "RepositoryManager" communicates to the "CollectionComponent" again which then fetches additional information from "OtherEntities".

Note: The actual components involved and the complexity of operations may vary based on the system's architecture. This is a simplified and generalized representation.

Sequence Diagram is a graphical representation that involves lots of UML specific syntax and components. Describing a sequence diagram specific to Plant UML using text is highly complex as it involves various elements like “actor”, “boundary”, “controller”, “entity”, “database” along with their interactions like "message" etc. However, I'll try to explain a basic flow which can be then used to model according to your specific needs using Plant UML. For converting this to Plant UML syntax, you may need PlantUML tool or an online converter.

Given your requirement, here's a basic flow of your interactions in a sequence diagram:

1. The Chef is able to view the ordered items and their status. 

2. Once the dish is ready to be served, the Chef interacts with the system to update the status of the item. 

3. The system confirms the changed status to the Chef and then sends information to the Waiter.

To represent it in a Plant UML like syntax : 

- It would start by representing an Actor (Chef) interacting with a boundary (System or application).

``` 
Actor Chef
Boundary System
```

- Chef is going to interact with the system, so you send a message from Chef to System.

```
Chef -> System: viewOrderStatus()

```

- Then you describe the results or actions within the system.

```
System --> Chef : displayOrderStatus()
```

- Then the Chef interacts again with the System to update status.

```
Chef -> System: updateOrderStatus()
```

- The System confirms back to the Chef about the updated status.

```
System --> Chef : confirmStatusUpdate()
```

- Then the System updates the Waiter about the changed status.

``` 
System -> Waiter: updateStatus()
```

This is a very simple interaction. Depending on your system, there might be several other components involved like a Server, a Database and there may be error or exception handling too.

If you would like to see this in PlantUML, you would need to use a PlantUML environment to validate and display it. I highly recommend to use real modelling tools to draw sequence diagrams, such as PlantUML, StarUML , Visual Paradigm Online, etc.

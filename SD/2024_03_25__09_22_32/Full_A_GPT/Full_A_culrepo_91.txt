Given the constraints of text-based platforms, it is impossible to generate a graphical representation of a sequence diagram using this. However, a UML sequence diagram can be easily coded in PlantUML language. Here is the textual representation of the diagram for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Adding Future Release Dates to Calendar

actor Admin
entity DB
entity Calendar
entity "New Report" as Report

Admin -> DB: Request report release dates
activate Admin
activate DB

DB --> Admin: Send release dates
deactivate DB

Admin -> Calendar: Add dates to calendar
activate Calendar

Calendar -> Report: Link release date with report
activate Report
Report --> Calendar: Confirm the linkage
deactivate Report

Calendar --> Admin: Confirm date addition
deactivate Calendar
deactivate Admin
@enduml
```

This behavior script begins with the DB/IR administrator (Admin) requesting the release dates from the DB. The DB then sends back the dates, which Admin adds to the Calendar. The Calendar links the release date with the new report and confirms the linkage. Finally, the calendar confirms to the admin the successful addition of future release dates.

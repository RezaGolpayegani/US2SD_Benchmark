Sorry as a text-based AI model i can't generate diagram instead I can propose a sequence of events in a text format for generating a Sequence Diagram:

1. `Plugin Developer` initiates a `Update Request` to upgrade the dataset-type code used by a dataset instance.

2. The `Update Request` interacts with the `Plugin Version Management System` to understand the latest version of the plugin.

3. `Plugin Version Management System` returns back information about the latest version to the `Update Request`.

4. If a new plugin version is available, the `Update Request` passes the upgrade command to the `Dataset Instance`. 

5. `Dataset Instance` will apply the upgrade thus changing the dataset-type code as per new updates.

6. Meanwhile, `Update Request` also interacts with the `Pipeline Management System` to apply changes to it. This interaction is to update the pipeline to use the updated version of the plugin.

7. `Pipeline Management System` with the help of `Update Request` updates the pipeline in accordance with the new plugin version. 

8. At the end of this sequence, `Plugin Developer` receives a confirmation that the update has been successfully done on the dataset-type code and the pipeline. 

Please remember this is a high level sequence. It does not take into account lower level details including potential error handling and confirmation of steps completion which you might need to add based on your specific requirements.

Here's the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the user story mentioned:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber "<b>Seq{#}"

actor Archivist as ar
database Files as f
entity System as s

ar -> s : Input restriction end date
s -> f : Request to update file
f -> f : Update file with restriction end date
f --> s : Send confirmation
s --> ar : Show confirmation message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows the following:
1. The Archivist inputs the restriction end date.
2. The system then requests to update the file with the provided date.
3. The file database updates itself with the given restriction end date.
4. A confirmation is then sent back to the system from the file database.
5. Finally, this confirmation message is shown to the Archivist.

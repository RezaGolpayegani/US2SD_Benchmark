Here's a detailed sequence diagram written in Plant UML format:

```plantuml

@startuml

participant "Site Visitor" as SV
participant "Website" as W
participant "Database" as D

SV -> W: Request to view articles
activate W
W -> D: Fetch public articles from database
activate D
D --> W: Return public articles
deactivate D
W --> SV: Display public articles
deactivate W

@enduml

```

Let's break down the diagram:
- The site visitor (SV) sends a request to the website (W) to view articles.
- The website gets the request and then makes a query to fetch the public articles from the databaSe (D).
- The database returns the requested articles to the website.
- Finally, the website displays the public articles to the site visitor.

Please note: 
This diagram assumes that there are public articles available and directly accessible by all visitors without needing to be a site member.

As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I cannot provide direct UML diagrams or code, but I can give you a descriptive way on how to create your sequence diagram based on the user story: "As an OlderPerson, I want to have some games that show me how good my memory and physical health is."

1. The OlderPerson interacts with the ALFRED system: User ("OlderPerson") sends a request to the ALFRED system ("Request Game Options").

2. The ALFRED system returns the selection of games: The ALFRED system ("ALFRED") processes the request and returns the list of available games for the OlderPerson ("Display Game Options").

3. The OlderPerson selects a game: The User again interacts with the ALFRED system to select a game from the list ("Select Game").

4. ALFRED starts the game: The ALFRED system processes the selected game request and starts the game ("Start Selected Game").

5. The OlderPerson plays the game: The User interacts with the ALFRED system during the game process ("Play Game").

6. Game shows memory and physical health status: After the OlderPerson finishes the game, the ALFRED system processes the game results and shows the memory and physical health status based on the game performance ("Display Health Status").

In PlantUML syntax, that could be described (in general form) as:

```
@startuml
actor OlderPerson
entity "ALFRED System" as ALFRED

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Request Game Options
ALFRED -> OlderPerson: Display Game Options

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Select Game
ALFRED -> OlderPerson: Start Selected Game

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Play Game
ALFRED -> OlderPerson: Display Health Status
@enduml
```

Please note that the exact implementation could vary based on the specific requirements and the structure of your application.

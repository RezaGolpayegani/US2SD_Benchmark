As this platform doesn't support the diagram creation, the following is a plain text representation of a possible sequence diagram in PlantUML format.

Please note that the specific operations and parameters might need to be adjusted based on the exact system requirements and design.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff Member" as staff

box "Library System" #LightYellow
participant "Metadata Customization Component" as mcc
participant "Metadata Database" as mdb
end box

staff -> mcc : initiateMetadataCustomization()
activate mcc

mcc -> mdb : retrieveCurrentFields()
activate mdb

mdb -> mcc : returnCurrentFields()
deactivate mdb

mcc -> staff : displayCurrentFields()
staff -> mcc : selectFieldToModify()
activate mcc

mcc -> staff : requestNewFieldInformation()
staff -> mcc : provideNewFieldInformation()
activate mcc

mcc -> mdb : updateFieldInformation()
activate mdb

mdb -> mcc : confirmUpdate()
deactivate mdb

mcc -> staff : displayUpdateConfirmation()
deactivate mcc

This diagram describes a sequence where a library staff member accesses a metadata customization component in the library system to customize metadata fields. The system retrieves the current fields, displays them to the staff member, and allows them to select a field to modify. The staff member specifies the new information for the field, and the system updates the metadata database and confirms the update.

Here is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: 

```
@startuml

participant "API User" as A
participant "API" as B
participant "System" as C
participant "Database" as D

A -> B: Request to normalise measures by GDP
activate B

B -> C: Validate request
activate C

C --> B: Confirmation of valid request
deactivate C

B -> D: Get datasets
activate D

D --> B: Return datasets
deactivate D

B -> B: Normalise data by GDP

B --> A: Return GDP-normalised data
deactivate B

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the API User makes a request to normalise measures by GDP. The API then validates the request with the System. Once it is confirmed valid, the API retrieves the datasets from the Database. The data are then normalised by GDP within the API, and finally, the GDP-normalised data are returned to the API User.

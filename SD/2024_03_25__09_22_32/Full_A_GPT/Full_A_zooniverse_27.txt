Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model I am unable to draw diagrams. However, I can provide a text representation of how your sequence diagram could look in PlantUML format. In a physical form, you would need collaborator who can interpret this into a physical diagram.

Here's a simple text representation:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Zooniverse Admin" as ZA
participant "Picture Analysis System" as PAS
participant "Citizen Annotations" as CA
participant "Talk Comments" as TC

ZA -> PAS: Initiate Analysis
activate PAS
PAS -> PAS: Evaluate Picture Based on Automated Analysis
PAS --> ZA: Return Automated Analysis
deactivate PAS

ZA -> CA: Retrieve Annotations
activate CA
CA --> ZA: Return Citizen Annotations
deactivate CA

ZA -> TC: Retrieve Comments
activate TC
TC --> ZA: Return Comments
deactivate TC

ZA -> ZA: Asses Picture (Based on Automated Analysis, Annotations, Comments)

@enduml
```

In this sequence, the Zooniverse Admin (ZA) initiates automated analysis of the picture, retrieves citizen annotations and comments from the system (represented by the Citizen Annotations (CA) and Talk Comments (TC) entities), and then uses these three pieces of information to assess the picture.

These are simplified exchanges. You might want to detail operations that the Zooniverse Admin performs on the retrieved information, or interactions among PAS, CA and TC. Please customize as per your exact use case.

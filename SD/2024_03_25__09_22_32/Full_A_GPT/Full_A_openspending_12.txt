Sure, below is a possible sequence diagram in Plant UML format to visualize the interaction between different components for the user story of Data Publishing User importing data from a Google Spreadsheet.

Please note that diagram is a simple representation and details will vary based on your actual system design.

```plantuml
title Import Data from Google Spreadsheet

actor "Data Publishing\nUser" as user

box "Data Packager System"
participant "Google Spreadsheet\nAPI" as API
participant "Import\nModule" as importModule
endbox

user -> importModule : Import data
activate importModule
importModule -> API : Request data
activate API
API -->> importModule : Return data
deactivate API
importModule -> importModule : Convert data format
importModule -->> user : Display imported data
deactivate importModule
```

In this scenario, the Data Publishing User initiates the process of data import. The Import Module in the system takes over and sends a request to Google Spreadsheet API to fetch the required spreadsheet. Once the data is received back from the API, it is converted to the required format by the Import module itself. The resultant data is then displayed back to the User.

This is a basic outline and additional steps could be necessary based on the actual implementation details. Consider this a starting point for your project.

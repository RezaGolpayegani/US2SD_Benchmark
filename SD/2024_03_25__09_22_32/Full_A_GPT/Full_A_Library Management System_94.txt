In order to show a sequence diagram for the user story of "As a librarian, I want to see the list of members.", here is a simple PlantUML format sequence diagram:

```PlantUML
@startuml
title List of Members

actor Librarian
boundary LibrarySystem 
database MemberDB

Librarian -> LibrarySystem : Request Member List
LibrarySystem -> MemberDB : Retrieve Member List
MemberDB --> LibrarySystem : Return Member List
LibrarySystem --> Librarian : Display Member List

@enduml
```
This sequence describes the interaction between the Librarian (who is initiating the request), the LibrarySystem (which is a boundary or interface where the request is being made) and the MemberDB (where the member data is stored). The list of members is retrieved from the MemberDB and returned to the LibrarySystem to be displayed to the Librarian.

Note: This is just a basic sequence diagram. Depending upon system's design and requirement, it can add some complexities like handling errors, multiple requests etc. which is not shown here.

Unfortunately, I'm an AI model developed by OpenAI, and I can't create diagrams directly. However, I can provide you with a template of how you can create the sequence diagram using PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Waiter" as W
participant "Restaurant Management System" as RMS
participant "Order System" as OS

W -> RMS : Request to see orders
activate RMS
RMS-> OS : Fetch orders
activate OS
OS-->RMS : Return orders
deactivate OS
RMS--> W : Show orders
deactivate RMS
@enduml
```

In this diagram:

1. The Waiter sends a request to the RMS (Restaurant Management System) to see the orders. 
2. The RMS communicates with the Order System to fetch the orders.
3. The Order System returns the orders back to the RMS.
4. The RMS then shows the orders to the Waiter.

This represents a simple sequence of the waiter's request to see the orders and the steps the systems follow to satisfy this request.

Each "->" is a directional arrow showing interaction or message passing from one entity (the one before the arrow) to its target entity (the one following the arrow).

The words following the directional arrow (like "Request to see orders", "Fetch orders", "Return orders", and "Show orders") represent actions or interactions taking place.

"Activate" followed by an entity means the entity starts working while "deactivate" followed by an entity implies stopping or completion of tasks.

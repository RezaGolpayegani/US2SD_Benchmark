Unfortunately, I can't provide a visual sequence diagram here for you (as I am a text-based AI just like a chatbot). But I can provide you a written UML sequence diagram script which you can use to generate the diagram in Plant UML. 

Here is the diagram script:

```
@startuml
title View Researchers Activity
participant "Supervisor" as S
database "Database" as DB
participant "Researcher" as R

S -> DB : request researchers' activity log 
activate DB 
DB --> DB: Authenticate Supervisor
DB -> DB : fetch researchers' activity
deactivate DB 
DB --> S: show researchers' activity log
note right : Supervisor can view \nwhat researchers were \ndoing on a given \ndate or period of time 
S --> R: Provide Feedback
deactivate S
@enduml
```

In this sequence, the supervisor S requests the researchers' activity log from the database DB, which then authenticates the supervisor, fetches the requested information, and returns it to the supervisor. The supervisor then gives feedback to the researcher R. 

Copy and paste this script on [PlantUML Online Editor](https://www.planttext.com) or any other PlantUML rendering software to view the sequence diagram. Also note that the complexity and completeness of the sequence diagram greatly rely on more detailed requirements on the interactions among the system entities. The provided sequence diagram is a high-level view, it could be different based on how the system is designed.

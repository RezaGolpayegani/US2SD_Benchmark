Unfortunately, I'm an artificial intelligence and I'm unable to create visual representations, including diagrams. However, I can guide you on how you could potentially create your Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the requested user story:

Title: Total Sales and Profits Determination

```PlantUML
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant System as S
participant Database as DB

M -> S: Request total sales and profits
activate S
S -> DB: Query sales and profit data
activate DB
DB --> S: Return data
deactivate DB
S --> M: Display total sales and profits
deactivate S
M -> S: Determine salaries based on profit
activate S
S -> DB: Update salary data
activate DB
DB --> S: Successful update
deactivate DB
S-->M: Confirm successful salary update
deactivate S

```
This diagram represents the sequence of actions that might occur in this scenario. Please note that this is a basic representation and actual implementation might vary based on your specific project requirements and other aspects of your system design that haven't been described.

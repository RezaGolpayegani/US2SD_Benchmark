Apologies for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I'm unable to create a graphical representation or diagrams. However, I can certainly provide you with a text representation of how the sequence diagram might look in PlantUML syntax based on the user story you provided:

```
@startuml
participant "LibraryManager" as A
participant "Book" as B
participant "Database" as C

A -> B: RequestBookDetails()
activate B
B --> A: ReturnBookDetails()
deactivate B

A -> A: GenerateUniqueID()
activate A
A --> A: ReturnUniqueID()
deactivate A

A -> C: AssignUniqueIDToBook()
activate C
C --> A: ConfirmIDAssignment()
deactivate C
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the "LibraryManager" requests book details from the "Book" object. Once the details are received, the "LibraryManager" generates a unique ID. After the unique ID is generated, it is assigned to the book in the "Database". When the assignment process is done, the "Database" returns a confirmation to the "LibraryManager". 

This is a very basic and abstract sample and actual implementation details can vary based on your specific use case. Please replace the function calls with your actual implementation specific function names or calls.

Please note that this is just the textual representation and you need to use an application or online service that interprets PlantUML syntax to visualize the sequence diagram.

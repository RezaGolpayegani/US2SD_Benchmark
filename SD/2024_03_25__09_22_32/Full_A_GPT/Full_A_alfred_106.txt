Based on your project description, here's the code for a simple PlantUML sequence diagram that might work for the user story:

```
@startuml
participant "OlderPerson" as A
participant "ALFRED" as B
participant "Health Database" as C

A -> B: Request for health tips
activate B
B -> C: Retrieve health tips based on user's health data
activate C
C --> B: Return health tips
deactivate C
B --> A: Display health tips
deactivate B
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
1. The OlderPerson sends a request to ALFRED for health tips.
2. ALFRED processes that request by reaching out to a Health Database, where it retrieves health tips that are relevant to the OlderPerson's health data. 
3. The Health Database returns these health tips to ALFRED. 
4. ALFRED then displays these health tips to the OlderPerson. 

Please note, you might need to enhance this based on the actual functional and technical details of your application. This is a simple representation and may not cover all aspects of your need.

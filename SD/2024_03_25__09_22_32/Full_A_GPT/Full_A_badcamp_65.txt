As an AI model, I am unable to physically draw diagrams. However, I can generate a text-based outline that you can follow to create your PlantUML sequence diagram according to the given user story.

The user story:
User : "As a anonymous user, I want to see a list of all the summits that include when they are, so that I can determine which summit I want to attend."

Here's the approach for the flow:

1. Anonymous User requests to access the website
2. System validates the request (it's an anonymous user)
3. System requests data from the Database- events list.
4. Database sends back the list of all the upcoming summits with their data and timings.
5. System displays that list to the Anonymous User
6. Anonymous User views the displayed summits 

Sequence Diagram in text (PlantUML syntax):

```
@startuml
participant "Anonymous User" as A
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D  

A -> S: Requests to access website
note right: System validates the request
S --> A: Access granted

S -> D: Requests events data
note right: Database sends back the data
D --> S: Sends summits data

S --> A: Displays list of summits
note right: User views the listed summits

```
Please implement the given syntax in PlantUML to generate a visual sequence diagram.

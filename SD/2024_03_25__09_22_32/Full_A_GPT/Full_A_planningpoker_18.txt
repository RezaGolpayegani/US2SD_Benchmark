Here's a basic Sequence Diagram in Plant UML for this User Story:

```plantuml
@startuml
Participant Moderator
Participant System
Participant "HTML File" as file

Moderator -> System: Request to export game transcript 
activate System 
System -> System: Compiles game transcript 
System -> file: Translates transcript into HTML 
activate file
file --> System: Returns HTML transcript 
deactivate file
System --> Moderator: Send HTML transcript 
deactivate System 
@enduml
```

This is the sequence for exporting game transcript into an HTML file:

1. Moderator requests the game transcript from the System.
2. The System compiles all the necessary data of the game transcript.
3. The compiled transcript is translated into HTML format by the System.
4. The HTML File is activated and returns the transcribed data back to the System.
5. System sends the HTML transcript to the Moderator.
6. The operation ends once the Moderator receives the HTML transcript. 

Please take note that additional operations may be necessary depending on the complexity and specific requirements of the system. This is just a basic representation that will need to be detail refined to fit the actual system's behavior.

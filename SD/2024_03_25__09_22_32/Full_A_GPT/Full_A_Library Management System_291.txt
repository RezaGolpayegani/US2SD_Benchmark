Creating a sequence diagram for your described user story requires a visual tool that Plant UML Language unfortunately can't provide through text. However, I can provide you the script to be used in the Plant UML Language to create the sequence diagram. Here is a basic example:

```
@startuml
actor Member
entity "Member Comments" as MC
database "Database" as DB

Member -> MC : Request to see comments
MC -> DB : Fetch comments of all members
DB -> MC : Return comments
MC -> Member : Display comments
@enduml
```
This is a very basic example of a sequence diagram for the user story you presented. 

1. This diagram suggests that a 'Member' makes a request to see other members' comments.
2. The request is received by "Member Comments" entity.
3. The "Member Comments" entity makes a request to the Database to fetch the comments.
4. The Database returns these comments to the "Member Comments" entity.
5. The 'Member Comments' entity, after processing, sends and displays these comments to the 'Member'.

To visualize this diagram, copy and paste this script in Plant UML visualizer or any UML tool that supports it. You can customize this script according to your requirement and specification of the task.

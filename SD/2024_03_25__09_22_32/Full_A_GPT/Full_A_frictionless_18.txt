I'm an AI language model and I can't actually create visual content or UML diagrams. However, I can certainly help you to write the script for a sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on your User Story. Here we go:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Get a Data Package into Clojure

actor Developer
entity DataServer
participant PackageManager
participant ClojureEnvironment

Developer -> DataServer : Request Data Package
activate DataServer
DataServer -> PackageManager : Check Data package
activate PackageManager
PackageManager --> DataServer : Return Data package validity
deactivate PackageManager
DataServer --> Developer : Send Data Package
deactivate DataServer

Developer -> ClojureEnvironment : Load Data Package
activate ClojureEnvironment
ClojureEnvironment --> Developer : Confirm Data Package loaded
deactivate ClojureEnvironment
@enduml
```

This PlantUML script describes the following sequence:

1. The Developer requests a Data Package from the DataServer.
2. The DataServer interacts with the PackageManager to check the validity of the Data Package.
3. The PackageManager returns the validity status to the DataServer.
4. The DataServer sends the Data Package to the Developer.
5. The Developer loads the Data Package into the Clojure Environment.
6. The Clojure Environment confirms to the Developer that the Data Package has been successfully loaded.

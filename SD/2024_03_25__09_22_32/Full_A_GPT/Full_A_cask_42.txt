Since it's not possible to create a diagram here, I'll provide a pseudo code of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the aforementioned user story:

```uml
@startuml

title User Specifies the Schema of a Dataset

actor User
participant App as A
participant System as S
participant Dataset as D

User -> A : Enter app
activate A

A -> A : Load dataset types
A -> User : Display dataset types

User -> A : Select a dataset type 
User --> A : Input schema details

A -> S : Send schema details
activate S

S -> D : Create dataset with schema
activate D

D --> S : Confirm creation
deactivate D

S --> A : Return confirmation
deactivate S

A --> User : Display confirmation message
deactivate A

@enduml
```

This diagram begins with the User entering the app (App). The App loads available dataset types and display them to the User. The User then selects a specific dataset type and inputs the appropriate schema details.

The App sends schema details to the System, which in turn creates a new dataset with the provided schema in Dataset. Once the dataset is created, the Dataset sends a confirmation back to the System, which then relays it back to the App. The App finally displays a confirmation message to the User regarding the successful dataset creation with the specified schema.

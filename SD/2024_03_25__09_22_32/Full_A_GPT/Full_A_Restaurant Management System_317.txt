In PlantUML, creating a Sequence diagram according to the provided user story could be something like this: 

```
@startuml
participant Waiter
participant RestaurantManagementSystem
participant Table

Waiter -> RestaurantManagementSystem: Update Waiting Time
activate RestaurantManagementSystem
RestaurantManagementSystem -> Table: Get Table Info
activate Table
Table --> RestaurantManagementSystem: Send Table Info
deactivate Table
RestaurantManagementSystem --> Waiter: Display Current Waiting Time
Waiter -> RestaurantManagementSystem: Enter New Waiting Time
RestaurantManagementSystem -> Table: Update Waiting Time 
activate Table
Table --> RestaurantManagementSystem: Confirm Waiting Time Updated
deactivate Table
RestaurantManagementSystem --> Waiter: Confirm Waiting Time Updated
deactivate RestaurantManagementSystem
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram represents the waiter requesting to update the waiting time from the restaurant management system, which interacts with the table to get the current information, displays it to the waiter, takes the new input from the waiter and updates the table accordingly. After confirmation from the table, the system sends a confirmation back to the waiter.

Please note, you should adapt it based on actual system's functionality and interactions between components.

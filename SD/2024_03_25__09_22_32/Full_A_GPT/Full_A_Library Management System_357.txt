As an AI, I'm not able to directly generate diagrams, but I can provide a textual representation of PlantUML sequence diagram based on your requirements. Given that the task is to specify unique id number for each book as a staff, the sequence might look like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Staff Member" as S
database "Book Database" as DB

S -> DB : Specify unique id for book
activate DB
DB --> DB: Checks if id already exists
DB --> S: Feedback (ID Assigned/ID Exists)
deactivate DB
@enduml
```

This PlantUML script describes the following sequence:

1. The "Staff Member" sends a request to the "Book Database" to specify unique id for a particular book.
2. The Book Database activates.
3. The Book Database performs a check to see if the specified id already exists in the system.
4. The Book Database then sends a feedback to the Staff Member stating either the unique id is Assigned or the ID already exists in the system.
5. The Book Database then deactivates.

You can visualize this sequence by pasting the script into a PlantUML editor.

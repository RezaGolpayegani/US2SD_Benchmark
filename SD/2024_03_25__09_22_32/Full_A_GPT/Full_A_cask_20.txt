This is the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the User Story you've described:

```
@startuml
actor DatasetDeveloper

box "App Artifact" #LightBlue
  participant "Dataset Type Code" as DTC
  participant "Dataset Instance" as DI
end box

box "Pipeline" #Pink
  participant "Sink & Source" as SS
end box

DatasetDeveloper -> DTC : Deploy Dataset Type
activate DTC
DTC --> DatasetDeveloper: Acknowledge Dataset Type Deployment
deactivate DTC

DatasetDeveloper -> DI : Create Instance
activate DI
DI --> DatasetDeveloper : Instance Created
deactivate DI

DI -> SS : Available as Sink & Source
activate SS
SS --> DI: Acknowledge Availability

DatasetDeveloper -> DI: Explore Dataset Instance
activate DI
DI --> DatasetDeveloper: Dataset Instance Details
deactivate DI

```

This diagram starts with the dataset developer deploying a dataset type, which gets acknowledged by the Dataset Type Code. Then, the developer creates an instance from the new dataset type, and the Dataset Instance confirms its creation. The new instance is then made available as a sink or source in the pipeline, and this availability is confirmed. Lastly, the Dataset Developer explores this new dataset instance, and the details are returned.

An example of a PlantUML sequence diagram script for the given user story could look like this:

```plantuml
@startuml

title Manager Orders View

actor Manager
participant "ManagementSystem" as MS
participant "OrderDatabase" as OD

Manager -> MS: Request to see orders
activate MS
MS -> OD: Fetch all orders
activate OD
OD --> MS: Return orders
deactivate OD
MS --> Manager: Display orders
deactivate MS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows that the Manager makes a request to the ManagementSystem to see all orders. The ManagementSystem then fetches all orders from the OrderDatabase, which returns the orders to the ManagementSystem. The ManagementSystem then displays all the orders to the Manager.

Note: You will need a PlantUML viewer or compiler to see the output of this code.

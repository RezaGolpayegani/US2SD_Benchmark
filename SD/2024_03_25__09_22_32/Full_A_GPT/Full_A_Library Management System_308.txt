From the description, there's no specific indication on how a member asks for suggestions or how the system is supposed to handle it. However, one possible scenario could be that a member requests for a suggestion, the system retrieves a random book and returns the suggestion to the member. Here is a PlantUML diagram for this:

```
@startuml
title: Random Book Suggestion Workflow

actor Member
participant System

Member -> System : RequestBookSuggestion()
activate System

System -> System : SelectRandomBook()
note right : System selects a random book from the database
activate System

System --> System : ReturnRandomBook()
deactivate System

System --> Member: BookSuggestion(randomBook)
deactivate System
note right : System sends a random book suggestion to the member

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram represents an interaction between a `Member` actor and the `System`. When the `Member` sends a `RequestBookSuggestion()` message to the `System`, it becomes focused (represented by the vertical rectangle on the `System` lifeline). The `System` then sends a `SelectRandomBook()` message to itself to select a book from the database. After that, it sends `ReturnRandomBook()` message to itself indicating that it's done with the selection process. Finally, it sends a `BookSuggestion()` message back to the `Member` with the selected book and it's no longer focused after that.

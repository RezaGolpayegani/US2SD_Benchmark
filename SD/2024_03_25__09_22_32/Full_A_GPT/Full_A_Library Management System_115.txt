As a Language AI model, I'm afraid I can't directly create diagrams, but I will provide you with a simple example of a UML sequence diagram in Plant UML text that you can generate according to your User Story:

```
@startuml
participant "Library Manager" as LM
participant "Book Record System" as BR

LM -> BR: Request to Create Book Record
activate BR
BR --> LM: Ask for Book Details
deactivate BR
activate LM
LM --> BR: Provide Book Details
deactivate LM
activate BR
BR -> BR: Create Book Record
BR --> LM: Confirm Record Creation
deactivate BR
@enduml
```
In this scenario, the Library Manager requests to create a Book Record on the Book Record System. The Book Record System, in response, asks for details of the new book from the Library Manager. After the Library Manager provides the details, the Book Record system creates the Book Record. Once the book record is successfully created, the Book Record system gives a confirmation message to the Library Manager.

Note: You can copy and paste the above Plant UML text into an online Plant UML editor to generate the diagram.

Please modify this based on your specific use case, add error handling and any other specifics for your system. 

Also, as an AI, I am not capable of knowing the full context of your system and this is a broad perspective, situations might occur where you would require more complex interactions.

I'm an AI text-based model and I can't draw diagrams, but I can help you create the Plant UML code:

```
@startuml

title DB/IR Administrator - Viewing Report Subscribers Sequence

actor "DB/IR Administrator" as dbAdmin

participant "System" 
participant "Database"

dbAdmin -> System : Request Subscriber List 
System -> Database: Fetch Subscriber List for Report
Database -->> System: Return Subscriber List
System -->> dbAdmin : Show Subscriber List 

@enduml
```
You can put this code in your plantUML client to render a sequence diagram. In this diagram, the DB/IR Administrator requests the list of subscribers for a specific report. The system then fetches this list from the database, returning it to the system, which then shows the list to the DB/IR administrator.

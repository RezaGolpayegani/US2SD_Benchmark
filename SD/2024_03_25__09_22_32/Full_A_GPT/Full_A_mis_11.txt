As an AI model, I'm not able to directly generate diagrams. However, I can write out some Pseudocode in PlantUML format that can help you understand how to create this diagram. Below is the Pseudocode for a sequence diagram for the user story mentioned:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Collection Replication Sequence

actor curator
entity "Repository System" as repository
database "Remote Storage Site" as storage
entity "Staff Interface" as interface

== Replication upon Ingest ==
curator -> repository : Ingest Collection
activate repository
repository -> storage : create Replication Queue
activate storage
storage --> repository : Queue Confirmation
storage -> repository : Start Replication

== Remote Replication Status ==
storage --> repository : Report Replication Status
repository -> interface : Update Interface
interface -> curator : Display Replication Status

deactivate repository 
@enduml
```

Using this PlantUML code, you should be able to create a sequence diagram through any web-based PlantUML tool. You enter this Pseudocode, and it will automatically generate the diagram for you.

This pseudocode assumes that, at first, a curator ingests a collection into the repository system. The system then queues it in the remote storage site for replication. The status of the replication is reported back to the repository system, which updates the staff interface. The curator can then view the replication status on the interface. Please adjust the pseudocode if the workflow is slightly different in your case.

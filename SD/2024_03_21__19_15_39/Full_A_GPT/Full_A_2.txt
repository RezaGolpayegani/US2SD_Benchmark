In this situation, you want a written user story to be converted into a sequence diagram that is represented in a Plant UML format. Below is a sample text-description of how it might be translated:

```plantuml
@startuml
User->App: Enter Credentials
App->AuthService: Validate Credentials
AuthService->App: Verification Status
alt Verification Passed
   App->Provider: Add Provider
   Provider->App: Confirmation
   App->DB: Store Provider Details
   DB->App: Confirmation
   App->User: Notify Success
else Verification Failed
   App->User: Notify Failure
end
@enduml
```
In this sequence diagram:

- The user enters their credentials into the app.
- The app sends these to the AuthService to validate.
- AuthServiceresponds back to the app with the verification status.
- If the verification pass:
   - The app will add a provider and the provider will send back a confirmation.
   - The app will then store the provider details in the DB.
   - The DB sends back a confirmation and the app notify the user of the successful operation. 
- If the verification fails, the app simply notify the user that the operation failed.

Sure! Here's a step-by-step example on how to create this in Plant UML format. However, as a text-based AI, I can't provide the diagram visualization, only the code.

Consider the participating entities as Customer, Banking System, and Bank Account. 

Now let's format this to PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Checking Account and Withdrawing Money Sequence Diagram

actor Customer
participant BankingSystem
participant BankAccount

activate Customer
Customer -> BankingSystem: Request to check account
activate BankingSystem
BankingSystem -> BankAccount: Fetch account details
activate BankAccount
BankAccount --> BankingSystem: Account details
deactivate BankAccount
BankingSystem --> Customer: Present account details
deactivate BankingSystem

Customer -> BankingSystem: Request to withdraw money
activate BankingSystem
BankingSystem -> BankAccount: Validate funds and withdraw money
activate BankAccount
BankAccount -> BankAccount: Check funds
BankAccount --> BankingSystem: Validate withdraw
deactivate BankAccount
BankingSystem --> Customer: Provide withdraw status and new balance
deactivate BankingSystem

This sequence diagram shows how a customer interacts with the Banking System to check their account balance and then later withdraw some amount. The Banking System has to fetch and validate account details by communicating with the Bank Account to provide the current balance and withdrawal status to the customer.

Sure, here's a simple version of a sequence diagram that might fulfill your user story. Please note that the actual implementation might need more steps depending on the actual Sender, Database or Email Service involved.

```plantuml

participant "Site Editor" as A

database "Content Management System (CMS)" as B

database "Email Service" as C

Participant "Certified Scrum Master or Product Owner" as D

A -> B: Access the CMS

B --> A: Grant access

activate A

A -> B: Edit the content of the email

activate B

B --> A: Confirm changes

deactivate B

A -> B: Save changes

activate B

B --> A: Confirm save

deactivate B

A -> B: Schedule email

activate B

B -> C: Send scheduling command with email content

activate C

C --> B: Acknowledge scheduling 

deactivate C

B --> A: Confirm email scheduled

deactivate B

C -> D: Send email at scheduled time



```
This sequence diagram notes the Site Editor (A) accessing and manipulating the Content Management System (B). After editing the content and saving the changes, the emails are scheduled for sending. The CMS then interfaces with an Email Service (C), which queues up the email and later sends it to the new Certified Scrum Master or Product Owner (D). 

Please keep in mind that this sequence diagram might need more details to cover your exact scenario, especially because certain terms (like "edit the content of the email") could cover broad functionalities and may involve more steps.

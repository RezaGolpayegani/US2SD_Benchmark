Here is a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format based on your user story:

```
@startuml
participant "Moderator" as M
participant "System" as S
participant "Game History" as G
participant "File System" as F

M -> S : Requests to export transcript

S -> G : Retrieves game transcript
activate G
G -->> S : Returns game transcript
deactivate G

S -> S : Formats transcript into HTML
activate S
S -->> S : Formatted transcript
deactivate S

S -> F : Save HTML file locally
activate F
F -->> S : Confirmation of saved file
deactivate F

S -> M : Confirmation and location of saved file
@enduml
```

In the above sequence diagram:

1. The Moderator (M) initially sends a request to the System (S) to export a game transcript.
2.  The System (S) retrieves this game transcript from the Game History (G).
3. Game History (G) then returns the game transcript to the System (S).
4. The System (S) formats this transcript into a HTML file.
5. Then, the System (S) saves this formatted HTML file locally in the File System (F).
6. The File System (F) confirms the saved file to the System (S).
7. Finally, the System (S) sends a confirmation and the location of the saved file to the Moderator (M).

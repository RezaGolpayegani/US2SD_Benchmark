Sure, here is a potential sequence diagram for your user story in Plant UML language.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Customize Metadata Fields Flow

actor "Library Staff Member" as member
entity "Metadata Management System" as system
database "Metadata Database" as db

member->system: Access project
activate system
system->db: Fetch project metadata
activate db
db-->system: Return current metadata
deactivate db
system-->member: Show current metadata

member->system: Request to customize metadata fields
activate system

system-->member: Display available metadata fields

member->system: Select/Enter new metadata fields

system->db: Update metadata fields
activate db
db-->system: Confirm updated fields
deactivate db

system --> member: Display confirmation of updated fields

@enduml
```
This sequence starts with a library staff member accessing a project, then the system fetches existing metadata. The staff member then requests to customize the metadata fields, the system displays available fields for customization, the staff member selects or enters new fields, then the system updates the metadata fields in the database and confirms the update to the staff member.

Please install a Plant UML viewer if you wish to view this diagram visually.

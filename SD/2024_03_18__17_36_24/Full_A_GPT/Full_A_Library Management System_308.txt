Sure, here is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a member, I want to take suggestions."

```
@startuml
participant "Member" as M
participant "System" as S
database "Database" as D

M->S: Request to view suggestions
activate S
S->D: Fetch suggestions
activate D
D-->S: Return suggestions
deactivate D
S-->M: Display suggestions
deactivate S
M->S: Choose a suggestion
activate S
S->D: Save choice
activate D
D-->S: Confirm save
deactivate D
S-->M: Confirm selection
deactivate S
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram assumes that a "Member" requests to view suggestions made by the "System". Then, the system gets these suggestions from a "Database". The suggestions are displayed to the "Member" who chooses one, and that choice is saved back in the "Database". The "System" then confirms the successful selection to the "Member".

To see the sequence diagram, you can paste the above code into a PlantUML renderer.

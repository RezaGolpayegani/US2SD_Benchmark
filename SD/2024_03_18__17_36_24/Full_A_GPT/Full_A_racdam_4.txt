Sequence Diagram:

```
@startuml
title Archivist Restricts a File From View

actor Archivist
entity FileManager
database FileDatabase

Archivist -> FileManager : Request to restrict file
activate FileManager

FileManager -> FileDatabase : Fetch file data
activate FileDatabase

FileDatabase --> FileManager : Send file data
deactivate FileDatabase

FileManager -> FileManager : Update file visibility
activate FileManager

FileManager --> FileManager : Confirm visibility updated
deactivate FileManager

FileManager --> Archivist : Confirm success in restricting file
deactivate FileManager

```

The language here creates a UML Sequence Diagram where the Archivist makes a request to the FileManager to restrict a file from view. The FileManager fetches the file data from the FileDatabase, then updates the file's visibility and confirms the update. Finally, the FileManager informs the Archivist that the file has been successfully restricted.

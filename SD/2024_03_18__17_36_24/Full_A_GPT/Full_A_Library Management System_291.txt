Sure, I can assist you with that. The following PlantUML code represents a sequence diagram based on your user story.

```puml
@startuml
actor Member

box "User Interface"
participant "Book List Page" as A
participant "Comments Section" as B
end box

box "Server Side"
participant "Database" as C
end box

Member -> A: Visit Book List Page
A -> C: Request comments data
activate A
activate C
C --> A: Return comments data
deactivate C
deactivate A
A -> B: Display comments as suggestions
B --> Member: Display comments
@enduml
```

This sequence begins when the Member visits the Book List Page. The system requests comment data from the Database. That data is then returned to the Book List Page. The comments, functioning as suggestions, are sent to be displayed in the Comments Section. These comments are then viewed by the Member. Keep in mind this is a simple mockup, the actual diagram might need additional classes or objects based on your software's architecture.

To visualize the flow you can copy and paste this code into a PlantUML online editor. Let me know if you need further assistance.

Caller.io can't generate visualization of the diagram due to technical Restrictions. Make sure to transfer this PlantUML code into a PlantUML file viewer for the graphical representation.

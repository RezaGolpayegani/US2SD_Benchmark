Below is a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to add a store order".

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant System
database OrderDB
Employee -> System: Enter store order details
activate System 
System --> Employee: Confirm store order details
activate Employee
Employee -> System: Confirm details
deactivate Employee
System -> OrderDB: Add new store order
activate OrderDB
OrderDB --> System: Update with order confirmation
deactivate OrderDB
System --> Employee: Display order added successfully message
deactivate System
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram uses actor (Employee), participant (System), and database (OrderDB). It begins with the Employee entering the store order details into the System. The System then asks the Employee to confirm the store order details. After the Employee confirms the details, the System adds the new store order to the OrderDB. Once the order is added successfully, the System updates with order confirmation and then sends a message to the Employee that the order has been added successfully.

Below is your requested PlantUML code for the sequence diagram. This diagram includes the OlderPerson as an actor interacting with a HealthAdvisor system which provides specific tips on reducing health impairments.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson
participant "HealthAdvisor\nSystem" as HAS

OlderPerson -> HAS : Inputs health details
activate HAS
HAS -> OlderPerson : Generates tailored health tips
deactivate HAS
OlderPerson -> HAS : Selects desired tip
activate HAS
HAS -> OlderPerson : Provides detailed info for selected tip
note right : This includes non-medication strategies like physical exercises, diet changes etc.
deactivate HAS
@enduml
```

The sequence diagram starts with the OlderPerson inputting his/her health details into the HealthAdvisor System. The system then generates tailored health tips depending on the provided information. The OlderPerson can review and select the desired tip. The system then provides further information about the selected tip which may involve physical exercises, diet changes, etc. 

You can use this PlantUML code in any PlantUML rendering software or online tool to generate the actual sequence diagram.

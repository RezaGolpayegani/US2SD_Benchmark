Here is the Plant UML code for your user story's sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
title Collection Replication
participant CollectionCurator as CC
participant Repository as R
participant RemoteStorageSite as RS
participant StaffInterface as SI

CC -> R : Ingest Collection
activate R
R -> R : Queue Collection for Replication
R -> RS : Replicate Collection
activate RS
RS --> R : Acknowledge Replication
deactivate RS
R --> CC : Inform Replication Status
CC -> SI : Update Collection's Replication Status
activate SI
SI --> CC : Display Updated Replication Status
deactivate SI
deactivate R
@enduml
```

To visualize, paste this code into a Plant UML generator or viewer. This diagram interacts the Collection Curator, Repository, Remote Storage Site, and Staff Interface.

Note 1: Ensure you have the correct setup required to render the Plant UML. Use an online PlantUML editor if the environment isn't set up.

Note 2: This is a base structure which gives the overview of interactions. There can be further interactions based on the internal details which aren't provided in the user story.

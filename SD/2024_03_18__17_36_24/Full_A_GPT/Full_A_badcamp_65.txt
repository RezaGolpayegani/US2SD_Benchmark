Sure, here's a sequence diagram expressed in Plant UML language:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Anonymous User" as A
participant "Website" as W
participant "Database" as DB

A -> W : Request list of summits
activate W
W -> DB : Get list of summits
activate DB
DB --> W : Return summit list
deactivate DB
W --> A : Display summits
deactivate W
@enduml
```

This is a simple scenario where an anonymous user makes a request, the website gets the list of summits from the database, and then displays them. More detailed operations may require a more complex diagram.

To use this code, you should copy it and put into an editor or tool that supports PlantUML language (like PlantText, PlantUML Online Editor, Visual Studio Code with a PlantUML extension, IntelliJ IDEA with a PlantUML plugin etc.).

You cannot use this generated sequence diagram straightâ€”an application or tool that can interpret PlantUML language is needed to generate the actual visuals of the diagram.

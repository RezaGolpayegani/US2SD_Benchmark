Sure, here's how you could illustrate this using a PlantUML sequence diagram.

```puml
@startuml

actor "Site Admin" as admin
boundary "Admin Interface" as UI
control "Ads Controller" as controller
entity "Ads Database" as db

admin -> UI : Select ad to edit/delete
UI -> controller : Send ad details
controller -> db : Request ad info
db --> controller : Respond with ad info
controller --> UI : Show ad info on the screen

alt edit
    admin -> UI : Make Changes and Save
    UI -> controller : Send updated ad info
    controller -> db : Update ad info
    db --> controller : Confirm update successful
    controller --> UI : Show confirmation to admin
else delete
    admin -> UI : Confirm Deletion
    UI -> controller : Send delete ad request
    controller -> db : Delete ad info
    db --> controller : Confirm ad deletion
    controller --> UI : Show confirmation to admin
end

```

The sequence diagram includes the site admin, an admin interface boundary, an ads controller that handles the admin's requests, and an ads database that stores ad details.

In the edit scenario, the admin selects an ad to edit, which prompts the interface to inform the controller. The controller retrieves the ad info, which is then displayed on the interface screen. The admin makes changes and saves. The updated ad info is sent to the ads controller, which carries out an update on the database. The database confirms success, and the controller sends the confirmation to the admin via the interface.

In the delete scenario, the process is similar: after the admin confirms deletion, the interface informs the controller, which deletes the ad from the database. The database confirms success, and this confirmation appears on the admin interface.

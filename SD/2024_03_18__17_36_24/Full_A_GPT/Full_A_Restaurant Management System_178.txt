Sure, here's a basic example of how you can create a sequence diagram for this user story in PlantUML format.

```
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
database "Order Database" as OD

Manager -> OMS : View Orders
activate OMS
OMS -> OD : Fetch Orders
activate OD
OD --> OMS : Return Orders
deactivate OD
OMS --> Manager : Display Orders
deactivate OMS
@enduml
```
In this diagram:

- "Manager" is the actor who wants to view the orders.
- The "Order Management System" is a system that handles the request from the manager.
- The "Order Database" is a database that contains all order data and returns it upon request.

Please note that this is a very simple and high level sequence diagram. The actual implementation could be different based on your actual system.

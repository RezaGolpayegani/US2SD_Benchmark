PlantUML doesn't support text-based drawings. However, I'll write out the steps in a format similar to PlantUML syntax for the given user story. You can later transform this information into a visual sequence diagram using a tool that supports PlantUML.

```
@startuml

actor "Data Publishing User" as DPU
participant "Platform" as P
actor "Platform Administrator" as PA
collections "GeoJSON sources" as GJ

DPU --> P : Login to Platform
activate P
P --> DPU : Show dashboard
DPU --> P : Navigate to GeoJSON sources
P --> GJ : Fetch GeoJSON sources
GJ --> P : Return GeoJSON sources list
P --> DPU : Display GeoJSON sources

alt Successful Access
    DPU --> P : Choose and Provide additional GeoJSON source
    P --> PA : Show notification of additional GeoJSON source
    PA --> DPU : Send confirmation of receipt
    deactivate P
else Unsuccessful Access
    DPU --> P : Request help
    P --> PA : Forward help request
    PA --> DPU : Provide assistance
    deactivate P
end

In this sequence diagram, it's defined that the 'Data Publishing User' (DPU) logs into the platform and is then shown a dashboard. The DPU then navigates to view GeoJSON sources and provides an additional GeoJSON source. This action generates a notification for the 'Platform Administrator' (PA). The PA then sends a confirmation of receipt to the DPU. If, on the other hand, the DPU struggles to access or add GeoJSON sources, they may request help, which gets forwarded to the PA who can provide assistance.

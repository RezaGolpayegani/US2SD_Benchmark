Sure, here's a PlantUML sequence diagram for your user story. You can modify it as per your website's real flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor "Site Visitor" as visitor
participant "Website" as website
participant "Database" as db
database "Article DB" as articleDB

visitor -> website : Browse Website
website -> db : Fetch Articles
db -> articleDB : Retrieve Articles
articleDB --> db : Return Articles
db --> website : Display Articles
website --> visitor: Show Articles
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the `Site Visitor` or user. That user goes to the website to `Browse Website`. Then, the website makes a request to the `Database` to `Fetch Articles`.

From there, the `Database` turns to the `Article DB` to `Retrieve Articles`. The `Article DB` then returns these articles back to the `Database`, which then tells the `Website` to `Display Articles`.

Finally, these articles are shown to the `Site Visitor`.

Please, note that to visualize this plantUML code you need to use a PlantUML viewer which can easily be found online or if you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ, you can install a PlantUML plugin.

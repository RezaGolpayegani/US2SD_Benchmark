Sure, here is a simple example of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "API" as A
participant "Data Storage" as DS

User --> UI : Request File F
UI --> A : Fetch File F
A --> DS : Retrieve File F
DS --> A : Return File F
A --> UI : Send File F
UI --> User : Display File F
@enduml
```

In this diagram, the actor `User` interacts with the `User Interface` to request for File F. This request is passed to the API, which subsequently interacts with `Data Storage` to retrieve File F. Once the file is retrieved, it is passed back to the user through the same chain.

You might adapt this to suit your exact needs; sequence diagrams can get complex depending on the level of detail you wish to include. Also, note that the Plant UML code provided should be used in an environment that supports Plant UML like certain IDEs or online editors.

Here is a sequence diagram written in Plant UML code. However, please note that for this diagram I made some assumptions: the older person interacts with a GameSystem which gives feedback on the game's progress and records the improvements. Also, I assumed that there's a Physical & Mental Exercise Game which represents the combination of mental and physical exercise the OlderPerson wants. 

```
@startuml

title OlderPerson Playing Physical& Mental Exercise Game

actor OlderPerson as OP
box "Game System"
    participant "Physical & Mental \nExercise Game" as PMG
    participant "GameProgress" as GP
    participant "ImprovementRecorder" as IR
end box

OP -> PMG : Start Game
PMG -> GP : Initialize Game
activate GP
PMG <-- GP : Confirm Game Initialization
OP <-- PMG : Show Game UI

OP -> PMG : Perform Opposing Motion Exercise
PMG -> GP : Evaluate Exercise Performance
activate GP
PMG <-- GP : Result of Performance Evaluation
OP <-- PMG : Display Performance Result

OP -> PMG : Perform Mental Exercise
PMG -> GP : Evaluate Exercise Performance
activate GP
PMG <-- GP : Result of Performance Evaluation
OP <-- PMG : Display Performance Result

OP -> PMG : End Game
PMG -> GP : Finalize Game 
activate GP
PMG <-- GP : Confirm Game Finalization
PMG -> IR : Record Improvements
activate IR
PMG <-- IR : Confirm Improvement Recording
OP <-- PMG : Show Game Summary

You can use an online or offline Plant UML tool to generate a Sequence Diagram using this code. Software such as PlantText, PlantUML Online Editor or Visual Studio Code extension for PlantUML can be used to render this UML. Make sure you adjust accordingly to your specific needs and context if necessary.

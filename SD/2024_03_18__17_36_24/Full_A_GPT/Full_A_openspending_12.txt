Sure, here is your detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format. To illustrate a simple data import scenario:

 ```plantuml
@startuml Import_Google_Spreadsheet

actor DataPublishingUser

DataPublishingUser -> GoogleSpreadsheet : Captures data needed

GoogleSpreadsheet -> DataPackager : Sends captured data

DataPackager -> DataConvertor : Requests data conversion

DataConvertor -> DataConvertor : Converts data format

DataConvertor --> DataPackager : Returns converted data

DataPackager --> GoogleSpreadsheet : Sends confirmation message

GoogleSpreadsheet --> DataPublishingUser : Displays confirmation message

@enduml
```

Just replace "GoogleSpreadsheet", "DataPackager", "DataConvertor" and "DataPublishingUser" with whatever your real class names are. This is a straightforward import scenario and assumes that processing is being done elsewhere after the data is imported. If you would like an error condition, conditional logic, or parallel processing, those would need to be added.

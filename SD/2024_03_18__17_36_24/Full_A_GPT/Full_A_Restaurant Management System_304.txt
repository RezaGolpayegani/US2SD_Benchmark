Here's a basic PlantUML sequence diagram that you could use for your user story. It assumes that the waiter interacts with a system to view orders.

```
@startuml

actor Waiter
participant "Order Management\nSystem" as System

Waiter -> System: Request to view orders
activate System
System --> System: Retrieve orders
System --> Waiter: Display orders
deactivate System

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes the following process:
1. The 'Waiter' sends a 'Request to view orders' to the 'Order Management System'.
2. The 'Order Management System' then begins an internal process, represented by 'Retrieve orders', to get the orders.
3. Finally, the 'Order Management System' sends a 'Display orders' back to the 'Waiter'.

According to your real system, you might need to add additional participants, messages, or detail to the diagram. The essential thing is to express the system's behavior from a sequence perspective. You might also use some advanced PlantUML features to enrich your diagram. Check out the official PlantUML website for more information.

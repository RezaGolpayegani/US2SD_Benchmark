As a language model AI, I'm unable to directly create a UML diagram. However, I can describe the series of interactions based on your user story:

1.-> API User: Sends a request to the API to normalize measures by GINI and related socioeconomic indexes.
2.--> API: Receives the request and processes it. The API validates the request if it contained all necessary parameters.
3.--> API: If validation was successful, API retrieves the necessary data from the database stored.
4.--> Database: Responds with the requested data.
5.<-- API: The API receives the data and starts processing to normalize by GINI and other indexes.
6.<-- API: Finally, the API returns the normalized data in the requested format (JSON, XML, etc.)

Here's a textual representation of the sequence diagram that you might be able to visualize using PlantUML or another diagramming tool:

API User -> API: Send Request(normalize by GINI)

API -> API: Validate Request

API --> Database: Retrieve Data

Database --> API: Respond with Data

API -> API: Normalize Data

API --> API User: Return Normalized Data

Remember to replace "->" with "-->" or "<--" with "<--" and the other directional symbols depending on the Arrow direction in your diagram tool.

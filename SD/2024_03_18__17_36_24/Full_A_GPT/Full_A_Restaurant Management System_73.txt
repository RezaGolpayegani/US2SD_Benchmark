Here is a detailed UML sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Menu Service" as Menu
database "Database"

Customer -> UI: Open app/website
UI -> Menu: Request menu
Menu -> Database: Fetch menu items
Database --> Menu: Return menu items
Menu --> UI: Display menu items
UI --> Customer: Show menu
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process where a Customer wants to see the menu. The diagram includes the customer, the UI interface, the Menu service, and the database.

1. The customer first interacts with the UI interface by opening the app or website.
2. The UI interface requests the menu from the Menu service.
3. The Menu service then fetches the details of the menu items from the database.
4. The database returns the details of the menu items back to the Menu service.
5. The Menu service provides these details to the UI interface, which displays the menu items.
6. Finally, the UI interface shows the menu to the customer.

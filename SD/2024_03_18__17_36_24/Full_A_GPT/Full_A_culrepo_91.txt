Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that describes the general flow of operations for this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Add Future Release Dates to Calendar

actor DB_IR_Administrator as admin
participant DataSet_Report as ds
participant CalendarApp as ca

admin -> ds : choose report/dataset with future release date
ds -> ds : validate selection
ds-- > admin : confirm selection
admin -> ca : add report/dataset release date to calendar
ca -> ca : validate and save the date
ca --> admin : confirm date added
@enduml
```
**Notes:**

- The actor "admin" stands for the DB/IR Administrator.
- "ds" refers to the selected DataSet/Report.
- "ca" stands for the Calendar Application.
- The arrows depict different interactions. An arrow from admin to ds (e.g., admin -> ds) indicates the actor initiates an action. A self-return arrow (e.g., ds -> ds) represents internal processing within an object. An arrow from one participant to another with a dashed line represents a response (e.g., ds -- > admin).

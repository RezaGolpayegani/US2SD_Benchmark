Here's a simple sequence diagram for you in PlantUML format which illustrates the process of viewing list of subscribers for a specified report:

```
@startuml
DB-IR Administrator -> Report Database: Request list of subscribers for specified report
activate Report Database
Report Database -> Subscriber Database: Fetch subscribers details for the report
activate Subscriber Database
Subscriber Database -->> Report Database: Return subscribers' details
Report Database -->> DB-IR Administrator: Return list of subscribers
deactivate Report Database
@enduml
```
In this sequence diagram:

- The `DB/IR Administrator` communicates with the `Report Database` to request the list of subscribers for a specific report.
- The `Report Database` will then communicate with the `Subscriber Database` to fetch the subscribers' details for the report.
- After getting the information, `Subscriber Database` sends back the subscribers' details to the `Report Database`.
- Finally, the `Report Database` returns the required list of subscribers to the `DB/IR Administrator`.

Remember, you will need a PlantUML viewer or compiler to convert this UML markup language into visuals. You can find one online or a plugin in many popular IDEs.

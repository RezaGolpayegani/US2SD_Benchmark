Sure, I can provide you a visual description. For actual code, you need an environment capable of rendering Markup or PlantUML. 

Here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as L 
participant "Search Box" as SB
participant "DisplayResults" as DR
participant "FilterOptions" as FO
participant "SortOptions" as SO

L -> SB : EnterSearchTerm()
activate SB
SB -> DR : ReturnSearchResults()
activate DR
L -> FO : ChooseFilterOption()
activate FO
FO -> DR : UpdateResults()
L -> SO : ChooseSortOption()
activate SO
SO -> DR : UpdateResults()
@enduml
```

Description:

1. The library member (L) starts the interaction by entering a search term in a search box (SB).
2. The search box returns the queried items and displays it through a component (DR).
3. Then the library member chooses to refine the results by selecting a filter option from the filter options interface (FO).
4. The filter option then updates the results based on the selection which further updates in the display results.
5. Further, for sorting the results, the library member selects a sorting method from the sorting options (SO).
6. The sorting option updates the display results accordingly.

Please note that this is a simplistic model and in real application the processes may involve more sophisticated operations including interactions with databases, error handling routines etc.

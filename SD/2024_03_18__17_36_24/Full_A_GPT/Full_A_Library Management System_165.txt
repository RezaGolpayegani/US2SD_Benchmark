Here is your detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Library Member" as A
participant "Library System" as B
participant "Database" as C

A->B: requestBookOrder("Title")

activate B
B->C: retrieveBooks()

activate C
note right
  Database retrieves the list
  of all books
end note
C-->B: bookList

B->B: sortBooksByTitle(bookList)
note right
  The Library System sorts the
  books based on the title
end note

B-->A: sortedBookList
note right
  Return the sorted book list to 
  the library member
end note

deactivate B
deactivate C
@enduml
```

You can paste this code into any PlantUML viewer to see the generated diagram. It outlines a process where a library member requests the books to be ordered by title, the library system retrieves the books from the database and sorts them, then returns the sorted list to the member. Please note the PlantUML viewer or application is required to convert this PlantUML code to a visual diagram.

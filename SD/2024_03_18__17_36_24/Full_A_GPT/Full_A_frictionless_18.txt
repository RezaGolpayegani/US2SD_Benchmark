Sure, here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the above user story. 

Please note that some steps might vary based on the actual implementation. This is a rough sequence diagram depicting the process based on general assumptions.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Getting Data Package into Clojure
actor Developer
participant ClojureIDE as IDE
participant API
participant DataPackage as Package

Developer -> IDE: Request Data Package
activate IDE
IDE -> API: Request Data Package
activate API
API --> IDE: Return Data Package
deactivate API
IDE --> Developer: Data Package Received
deactivate IDE
Developer -> Package: Start Data Analysis
activate Package
Package --> Developer: Provide Analysis
deactivate Package
Developer -> Package: Start Visualization
activate Package
Package --> Developer: Provide Visualization
deactivate Package
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, a Developer requests a data package from the Clojure Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE retrieves the data package by making a request to an API. The API returns the data package to the IDE, which then passes it on to the Developer. Then, the Developer begins doing data analysis and data visualization with the Package. This process repeats for data analysis and visualization.

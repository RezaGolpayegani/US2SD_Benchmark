Here is the sequence diagram for the user story you provided, represented in the Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
actor DataReuser as DU
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Dataset Manager" as DM

DU -> Web : Request to View Dataset Details
activate Web
Web -> DM : Retrieve Dataset Details
activate DM

DM -> Web : Return Dataset Details
deactivate DM
Web -> DU : Display Dataset Details including Citation
deactivate Web
@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the `DataReuser` and includes a `Web Interface` (which could be the front-end of a data platform) and a `Dataset Manager` (which could be a server-side system handling data).

Please note that this diagram is simple and assumes that the `DataReuser` is already on the dataset's web page or has the dataset ID on hand to trigger the needed functionalities. It also assumes that the citation is part of the dataset details provided by `DataSet Manager`. You might extend it to include system details like Database or any other services. Adjust this diagram as necessary to accurately reflect the specific behaviors and components involved in your own system.

This diagram first begins with the Repository Manager logging into the system, where they are shown the dashboard, from here they have three branches they could navigate. 

The first branch involves editing an object's details, with a focus on its description. After any changes are made, they then finalize the change inside the system.

The second involves updating collection where again changes are made and a message of successful updating is sent by the system.

The third branch includes the deletion of collection where a message of successful deletion is sent by the system. After any action, a finalizing step is present to confirm the changes.

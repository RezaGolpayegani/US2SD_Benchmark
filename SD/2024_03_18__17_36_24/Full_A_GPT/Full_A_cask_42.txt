Here is a sequence diagram created in the PlantUML markup language to reflect your user story.

Do note that you'll need to adjust the code based on the exact entities involved in your system and its specifications.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Dataset" as D
participant "Dataset Schema Specification System" as DS

User -> DS : Specify Schema Details across Dataset Types
activate DS
DS -> D : Set Schema 
activate D
note over D: Dataset class takes the user specified schema and sets it across all types
D --> DS : Return User Message - Schema applied successfully
deactivate D
DS --> User : Display User Message
deactivate DS
@enduml
```

**Legend:**
1. `User` is initiating the process by specifying schema details for the variety of datasets.
2. The `Dataset Schema Specification System (DS)` receives the user's schema request and interacts with the `Dataset (D)`.
3. The Dataset in our scenario could refer to any dataset among the various types in the system. DS sends a 'Set Schema' message to the Dataset with the user-specified schema.
4. The Dataset then applies that schema to itself. 
5. Once the schema has been applied, Dataset returns a message to DS indicating the schema has been successfully applied. 
6. DS then forwards this success message to the User.

In this sequence diagram, we have assumed that the schema setting process is successful. You can expand this diagram to consider error cases and how these errors will be handled.

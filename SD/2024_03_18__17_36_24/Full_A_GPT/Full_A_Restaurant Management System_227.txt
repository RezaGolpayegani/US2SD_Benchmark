Sure, here's a basic draft for a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax that plots out the interaction between a Restaurant Employee, an Order Display System and an Order Database. Consider editing this sample if your system's design or interconnections differ.

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor "Restaurant Employee" as RE
entity "Order Display System" as ODS
database "Order Database" as ODB

RE -> ODS : View Active Orders
activate ODS
ODS -> ODB : Fetch Active Orders
activate ODB
ODB --> ODS : Ordered Active Orders by Date
deactivate ODB
ODS --> RE : Display Active Orders
deactivate ODS
@enduml
```

This simple sequence starts with the restaurant employee expressing the intent to view active orders. The Order Display System then fetches these active orders from the Order Database, which returns them sorted by their start date. The Order Display System than displays these ordered active orders to the restaurant employee.

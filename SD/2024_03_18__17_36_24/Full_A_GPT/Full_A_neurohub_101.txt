This diagram represents the sequence of actions when a researcher uploads a paper to a shared repository. It shows how another researcher can download the paper, upload a reviewed version, and how the original researcher can download that reviewed paper and comments on it. The other researcher can then view these comments. 

This is a very simplified view and each of these stages could be expanded depending on the exact requirements of your project. For example, the "Upload Paper" process might include sub-steps for specifying the type of document, setting permissions, etc. Consider this as a basic example and feel free to modify as necessary.

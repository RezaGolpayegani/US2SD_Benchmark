In PlantUML format, this sequence diagram can be created as follows:

```
@startuml
title Due Date Sequence Diagram - Member

actor Member as M
actor LibrarySystem as LS
database LibraryDatabase as LD

activate M
M -> LS: Request Due Date
LS -> LD: Fetch Book Info
activate LD
LD --> LS: Return Book Info
deactivate LD
LS --> M: Display Due Date
deactivate M
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the main actor is the member (M), who interacts with the Library System (LS) to request the due date of a certain book. The Library System then retrieves this information from the Library Database (LD) and returns it back to the member. This is a simple view of how the system might work, and the actual process may have additional complexities.

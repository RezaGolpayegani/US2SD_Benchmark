Sure, here is a simple Sequence Diagram in PlantUML code for you to update online reservations for books:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Reservation System" as R
participant "Database" as D

Member -> R : Request available books
R -> D : Fetch available books
D --> R : Response with available books
R --> Member : Show available books
Member -> R : Select book and update reservation
R -> D : Update reservation data
D --> R : Confirmation of update
R --> Member : Show confirmation message
@enduml
```

In this diagram:

- A member interacts with the reservation system to get available books.
- Reservation system asks Database to fetch available books.
- Database returns the list of available books to the Reservation system.
- Reservation System shows the available books to Member.
- Member selects a book and requests to update the reservation.
- Reservation System updates the reservation data in the Database.
- Database sends a confirmation to the Reservation system.
- Reservation System shows a confirmation message to the Member.

You can input the code into a PlantUML compiler to visualize the diagram.

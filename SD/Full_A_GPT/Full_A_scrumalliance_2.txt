Sure, here is a basic sequence diagram of your user story in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Member" as M
participant "Website" as W
participant "Server" as S

M -> W : Click "Apply for CSP"
activate W
W -> S : Request Application Form
activate S
S --> W : Send Application Form
deactivate S
W --> M : Show Application Form
deactivate W
M -> W : Fill Out and Submit Form
activate W
W -> S : Send Submitted Form
activate S
S --> W : Acknowledge Form Submission
deactivate S
W --> M : Show Acknowledgement Message
deactivate W
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the member clicking an "Apply for CSP" button on the website. The website then requests the application form from the server, which replies with the form. This is then displayed to the user. 

The user then fills out and submits the form via the website, and the website sends this to the server. The server acknowledges the form submission and relays this back to the user.

Remember to adjust the diagram accordingly to represent the specific set of interactions in your actual system, as there might be other participants involved in the process (a database for storing the application, an email service for sending a confirmation email, etc.).

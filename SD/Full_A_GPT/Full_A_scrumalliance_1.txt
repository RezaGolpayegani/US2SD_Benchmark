This breakdown assumes that you are starting from a state where the user is already logged in.

- User initiates changes to his/her profile by clicking "Edit Profile" in their personal page.
- Personal Page communicates with the Database to fetch current profile information.
- Database returns current profile data to Personal Page.
- Personal Page displays Edit Profile Page with pre-filled profile data to the User.
- User fills up the form with their details. It may include both structured data like Name, DOB as well as semi-structured data like Hobbies, Bio etc.
- Personal Page then processes the entered data and sends it to the Database for updation.
- Database confirms the successful updation to Personal Page.
- Personal Page then displays the newly updated profile to the User.

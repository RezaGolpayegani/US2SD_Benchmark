Here is a PlantUML sequence diagram that represents the process of a site member describing himself on his own page:

```
@startuml
actor User

User -> MemberPage : Access Profile Page
activate MemberPage

MemberPage -> DescribeForm : Open Form
activate DescribeForm

User -> DescribeForm : Fill Out Form
DescribeForm -> MemberPage : Update Profile

deactivate DescribeForm
deactivate MemberPage

@enduml
```

In the diagram:
- The User accesses his Member Profile Page.
- The site prompts a form with fields to fill (DescribeForm) in a semi-structured way.
- The User fills out the form and saves.
- The user's profile on Member Page gets updated accordingly.
- The form deactivates and the user goes back to an updated member profile page.

You can use any online PlantUML renderer to visualize the sequence diagram.

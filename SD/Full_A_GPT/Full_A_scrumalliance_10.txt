Sure, here's a basic example of a sequence diagram you can create for your scenario in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor User
participant "ProfilePage" as A
participant "ProfileController" as B
participant "UserService" as C
User -> A: Clicks "Private Mode"
A -> B: managePrivacySetting(private)
B -> C: setPrivacyMode(user, private)
note right: UserService updates the\nuser profile's settings\nto private.
C --> B: Settings updated
B --> A: Update confirmation
A --> User: Display confirmation message
@enduml
```

You can visualize this diagram by using some PlantUML online viewer or IDE plugin.

Note that this is a very simplified example. The actual implementation can have many details depending on the system's structure, available services, etc.

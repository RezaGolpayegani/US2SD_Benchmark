Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram written in PlantUML format that illustrates the mentioned user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Make Profile Private

actor "Site_Member" as user

box "Website"
participant "User_Profile_Service" as service
endbox

user -> service: requestProfilePrivacyChange(status: private)
activate service

group Validate User
    service -> service: validateUser()

    alt Unauthorized User
        service --x user: Unauthorized Access
    else Valid User
        service -> service:user.setProfileStatus(private)
        service -->> user: Profile Updated Successfully
    end
@end

@enduml
```
You can render this diagram using a tool that supports PlantUML, such as the online PlantUML editor or Visual Studio Code with a PlantUML plugin. The diagram shows that a site member makes a request to change their profile privacy to private. The User Profile Service within the website validates the legitimacy of the user before proceeding. If unauthorized, the service will respond with "Unauthorized Access". If authorized, the service will set the user profile status to private and respond with "Profile Updated Successfully".

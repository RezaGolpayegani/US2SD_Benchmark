Sure, here is a representation of your user story translated into a sequence diagram in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
actor User
participant Site 
participant Database

User -> Site: Login/Authentication
activate Site

Site --> User: Success/failure response
deactivate Site
activate User

User -> Site: Request to view profiles
activate Site

Site -> Database: Fetch member profiles
activate Database

Database --> Site: Return profiles
deactivate Database

Site --> User: Show profiles
deactivate Site

User -> Site: Send connection request to a member
activate Site

Site -> Database: Store connection request
deactivate Site
activate Database

Database --> Site: Confirmation of stored request
deactivate Database
activate Site

Site --> User: Connection request sent
deactivate Site

```

The sequence diagram shows the series of interactions that would occur between the "User", "Site" (or software application), and "Database" in realizing the user story. The process starts from login, to viewing profiles, and finally sending a connection request to a member. 

Please do remember that this is a general implementation and might not cover all edge cases or details. Modifications might be needed to fit the actual application design or hidden functionalities.

You need to have a text editor to write down the PlantUML code or use an online PlantUML editor. Here is how you can make a sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
title View Member Profile

"Site Member" -> "Website Interface" : Navigate to member's profile
"Website Interface" -> "Database" : Request member profile data
Database --> "Website Interface" : Return profile data
"Website Interface" --> "Site Member" : Display member's profile
@enduml
```

This is a basic sequence diagram. Based on the user story, the Site Member navigates to view another member's profile through the Website Interface. The Website Interface then requests the profile data from the Database. When the Database returns the data, the Website Interface then displays the member's profile to the Site Member.

Depending on your exact process flow, you might adjust this diagram according to your needs.

In this diagram, a site member interfaces with a website to fill and submit an application to become a Certified Scrum Trainer. The website requests the application form from a theoretical "Certification Database," and once filled, submits the completed application to the database. Upon successful submission, a confirmation is given back to the site member.

Please remember to replace generic terms such as "Website" and "Certification Database" with actual system or service names in your context.

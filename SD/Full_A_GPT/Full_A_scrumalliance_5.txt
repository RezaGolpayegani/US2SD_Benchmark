Sure, here is a sequence diagram that describes the interactions between a Trainer (Actor), Profile Service (Control), and Profile Database (Entity).

```plantuml
@startuml
Actor Trainer
Control ProfileService
Entity ProfileDatabase

Trainer -> ProfileService: OpenProfileEdit()
activate ProfileService

ProfileService --> Trainer: ShowProfileEditForm()
deactivate ProfileService
activate Trainer

Trainer -> Trainer: FillFormDetails()
Trainer -> ProfileService: SubmitProfileEdit(newDetails)
deactivate Trainer
activate ProfileService

ProfileService -> ProfileDatabase: UpdateProfile(newDetails)
activate ProfileDatabase

ProfileDatabase --> ProfileService: AcknowledgeProfileUpdated()
deactivate ProfileDatabase
activate ProfileService

ProfileService --> Trainer: ShowUpdatedProfile()
deactivate ProfileService
activate Trainer

This diagram describes the following steps:
1. The Trainer requests to edit his/her profile from the Profile Service.
2. The Profile Service shows a form to the Trainer for editing the profile.
3. The Trainer fills in the form details including additional details about him/her.
4. The Trainer then submits the form to the Profile Service with the new details.
5. The Profile Service updates the profile of the Trainer in the Profile Database with the new details.
6. The Profile Database acknowledges the successful update of the profile.
7. The Profile Service shows the updated profile of the Trainer.

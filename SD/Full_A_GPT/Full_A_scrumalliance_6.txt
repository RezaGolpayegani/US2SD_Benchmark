The diagram begins with the practitioner logging into the system. After that, an interaction occurs between the system and the practitioner, where the system provides tools for the practitioner to write their article. After writing the article, the practitioner requests a visual for their (CST/CSP) status from the system and uploads it. Upon confirmation from the system that the image has been uploaded, the practitioner submits their article for approval. The system relays this information to the site, where it is approved. The practitioner is notified of this approval and proceeds to publish the article. The system updates the site with the article, and once confirmed, informs the practitioner that their article is now live on the site.

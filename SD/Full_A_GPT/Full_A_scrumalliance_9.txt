Sure, here is a representation of your user story in a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Site Member" as member
participant "Search Function" as search
database "Profile Database" as db

member -> search: Input search parameters
activate search
search -> db: Queries for matching profiles
activate db
db --> search: Returns matched profiles
deactivate db
search --> member: Shows matched profiles
deactivate search
@enduml
```
This diagram visualizes the interaction of a site member with the search function and the profile database. The site member inputs search parameters into the search function. The function then queries the database for matching profiles. The database returns matched profiles to the search function which then shows those matched profiles to the site member.

Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram for your user story in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
actor Practitioner

box "User Interface"
participant ProfilePage
end box

box "Back-End"
participant UserDetailService
database DetailDatabase
end box

Practitioner -> ProfilePage : Clicks "Edit Profile" button
ProfilePage -> UserDetailService : Send request to get data
UserDetailService -> DetailDatabase : Fetch User Data
DetailDatabase --> UserDetailService : Return User Data
UserDetailService --> ProfilePage : Return User Data

Practitioner -> ProfilePage: Input new details
ProfilePage -> UserDetailService: Update Request
UserDetailService -> DetailDatabase: Update User Data
DetailDatabase --> UserDetailService: Confirm Update
UserDetailService --> ProfilePage: Confirmation Message
ProfilePage --> Practitioner: Show "Profile Updated" message
@enduml
```

In this sequence, after the Practitioner selects to edit their profile, the front-end (`ProfilePage`) requests the current user details from the back-end service (`UserDetailService`). This service retrieves the data from the database (`DetailDatabase`) and returns it back to the UI.

Then, the practitioner can intimate their new details. The request to update is sent from the profile page to the UserDetailService. The service updates the user data in the DetailDatabase and sends back a confirmation. This confirmation is shown to the Practitioner.

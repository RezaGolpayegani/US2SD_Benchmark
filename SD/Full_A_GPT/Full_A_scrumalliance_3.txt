Here is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram for your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Practitioner
boundary "Profile Page" as Profile
database "Data Storage" as DB
  
Practitioner -> Profile: Access profile page
Profile --> Practitioner: Show profile data
Practitioner -> Profile : Request to add additional details
Profile --> Practitioner: Provide form for additional details
Practitioner -> Profile: Submit form with new details
Profile -> DB: Push new details to database
DB --> Profile: Confirm receipt of data
Profile --> Practitioner: Success message

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram visualizes interactions among different system components as follows: the Practitioner accesses the Profile Page, requests to add additional details, provides and submits these details; the Profile Page pushes these new details to the Data Storage (database) and, once confirmation is received, sends a success message back to the Practitioner.

== Interface Separation Process ==
Developer -> VCS: Checkout latest dataset type code
note right of Developer: Review and define\ninterface for dataset type
Developer -> InterfaceRepo: Commit interface code
activate InterfaceRepo
InterfaceRepo -> VCS: Create new interface version
deactivate InterfaceRepo

== Implementation ==
note over Developer: Implement functionality\nbased on the interface
Developer -> ImplRepo: Commit implementation code
activate ImplRepo
ImplRepo -> VCS: Create new implementation version
deactivate ImplRepo

== Integration ==
Developer -> VCS: Tag and release new dataset type version
VCS -> Application: Notify new version availability
Application -> VCS: Pull interface
Application -> VCS: Dynamically link to implementation at runtime

note over TM, PM : Once a basic prototype is ready,\nit's showcased for initial feedback.

TM -> PM : Demonstrates prototype
PM -> TM : Provides feedback\nand suggests improvements

group Iteration Cycle
    TM -> TM : Refines prototype based on feedback
    TM -> PM : Shows updated prototype
    PM -> TM : Gives final approval to proceed with user testing
end

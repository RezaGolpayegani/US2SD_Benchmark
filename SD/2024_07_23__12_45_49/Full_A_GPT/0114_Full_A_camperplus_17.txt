Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML requires breaking down the interaction into steps. Since detailed sequence diagrams can be extensive, I'll provide a simplified yet comprehensive version of the process to illustrate how a camp administrator can provide bi-weekly feedback to camper's parents through the Camp Management & Communication Platform.

PlantUML code for your User Story "`As a camp administrator, I want to provide bi-weekly feedback to camper's parents, so that they can be aware of their child's behavior and performance.`"

This scenario presumes the existence of a feedback module within the platform, a mechanism for scheduling feedback intervals, and a feature for administrators to write and send feedback. Moreover, it's assumed there's a parent portal or interface where feedback can be received and viewed.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator
participant "Feedback \n Module" as FeedbackModule
participant "Scheduling \n System" as SchedulingSystem
participant Database
participant "Parent \n Portal" as ParentPortal
actor Parent

== Setup Bi-Weekly Feedback ==
Administrator -> FeedbackModule : scheduleBiWeeklyFeedback()
FeedbackModule -> SchedulingSystem : triggerIntervalSetups()
SchedulingSystem --> FeedbackModule : confirmSchedule()
FeedbackModule --> Administrator : scheduleConfirmation()

== Generate Feedback ==
loop Every Two Weeks
    SchedulingSystem -> FeedbackModule : triggerFeedbackGenerationEvent()
    FeedbackModule -> Administrator : promptFeedbackInput()
    Administrator -> FeedbackModule : submitFeedbackDetails(camperId, feedbackText)
    FeedbackModule -> Database : saveFeedback(camperId, feedbackText)
    Database --> FeedbackModule : feedbackSavedConfirmation()

    == Notify Parent about Feedback ==
    FeedbackModule -> ParentPortal : notifyParent(camperId)
    ParentPortal -> Parent : displayNotification()
end

Parent -> ParentPortal : login()
Parent -> ParentPortal : viewFeedback(camperId)
ParentPortal -> Database : fetchFeedback(camperId)
Database --> ParentPortal : returnFeedbackDetails()
ParentPortal --> Parent : displayFeedbackDetails()

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Setup Bi-Weekly Feedback:** The camp administrator schedules the bi-weekly feedback through the feedback module, which then sets up the schedule in the system. The feedback module confirms the schedule back to the administrator.

2. **Generate Feedback:** Every two weeks, the scheduling system prompts the feedback module to trigger a feedback generation event. The administrator is prompted to input feedback details for campers. This feedback is then saved in the database.

3. **Notify Parent about Feedback:** Once feedback is saved, the parent portal notifies the camper's parent that new feedback is available.

4. **Parent Views Feedback:** The parent logs into the parent portal, views feedback for their child after it fetches the details from the database, and the system displays the feedback details.

Remember, this is a simplified sequence diagram focusing on the key interactions outlined in the user story. Depending on the platform's complexity and additional features, you might need to include more detailed steps or interactions between system components.

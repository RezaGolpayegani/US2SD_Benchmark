Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the stated user story "As a manager, I want to create a menu so that customers can display the products" entails mapping out the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Below is a simplified PlantUML code representing this scenario. Please note, due to the complexity and the broad functionalities of the described system, the below sequence focuses on the core interaction to accomplish the goal from the perspective of a restaurant manager adding items to the menu.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management UI" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> UI : Access management portal
UI -> Server : Request authentication
Server -> DB : Validate credentials
DB -> Server : Authentication successful
Server -> UI : Authentication response (success)
UI <-- Manager : Authenticated session begins

Manager -> UI : Navigate to "Create Menu Item"
UI -> Server : Request ingredient, category, and pricing data
Server -> DB : Query required data
DB -> Server : Respond with data
Server -> UI : Display data forms with options
UI <-- Manager : Fill in new menu item details

Manager -> UI : Submit new menu item
UI -> Server : Send new item data
Server -> DB : Store new menu item
DB -> Server : Confirm item stored
Server -> UI : Confirm item creation
UI <-- Manager : Display creation success message

Manager -> UI : Publish/update menu
UI -> Server : Request menu publish
Server -> DB : Update menu status
DB -> Server : Confirm menu updated
Server -> UI : Confirm menu publication
UI <-- Manager : Display publication success message

This diagram depicts the process flow from a manager's perspective when creating a new item in the restaurant menu, starting from authentication to updating and publishing the new menu for customers to view. This involves multiple steps and interactions with the system's front-end (Management UI), back-end server, and database.

To execute the above PlantUML code:

1. You need to have PlantUML set up in your local environment or use an online PlantUML editor.
2. Paste the above code into the editor or command-line interface.
3. Generate the diagram following the tool's provided instructions.

The diagram simplifies the process for clarity and focuses on the creation and publication of a new menu item. In a real-world scenario, you might have additional steps or interactions, such as error handling, user permissions checks, and more detailed feedback mechanisms for each operation.

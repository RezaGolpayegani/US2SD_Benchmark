Given the requirements from the user story, we need a sequence diagram that illustrates the process from the viewpoint of a site visitor wanting to read FAQs. The process includes interactions between the user (site visitor), the Scrum Alliance Community Platform's interface, and the backend systems managing the FAQ content. 

Note: The steps are simplified for clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant SiteVisitor as Visitor
participant WebInterface as Interface
participant FAQSystem as FAQ

Visitor -> Interface : Navigate to FAQ section
Interface -> FAQ : Request FAQ content
FAQ -> Database : Query FAQ data
Database -> FAQ : Return FAQ data
FAQ -> Interface : Send FAQ content
Interface -> Visitor : Display FAQs

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Site Visitor (Actor):** This is the user who wants to read the FAQs. The action starts with them navigating to the FAQ section of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform.

2. **Web Interface (System):** Represents the user interface of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform. This interface receives the request from the site visitor to access the FAQ section.

3. **FAQ System (Subsystem):** This subsystem is responsible for managing FAQ content. It receives the request for FAQ content from the web interface.

4. **Database:** Represents the persistent storage where FAQ content is stored. The FAQ system queries this database to retrieve the requested FAQ content.

5. **Process Flow:**
   - The site visitor initiates the process by requesting to view the FAQ section through the web interface.
   - The web interface forwards this request to the FAQ system, which in turn queries the database for the necessary FAQ content.
   - The database returns the FAQ data to the FAQ system.
   - The FAQ system then sends this content back to the web interface.
   - Finally, the web interface displays the FAQs to the site visitor.

This sequence diagram is simplified to focus on the core interactions related to accessing FAQ content. Actual implementations might include additional steps or processes such as error handling, caching for performance optimization, and security checks.

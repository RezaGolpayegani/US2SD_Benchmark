Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a student, I want to be able to search for books" involves defining the interactions between the student (user), the system interfaces, and the database in a step-by-step manner. 

Given the magnitude of interactions and the limitations of displaying diagrams here, I'll describe how to frame this sequence diagram in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student as S
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Book Management System" as BMS
participant "Database" as DB

S -> SI: Enter search criteria\n(Title, Author, Category, Date)
activate SI

SI -> BMS: Request book search\nwith criteria
activate BMS

BMS -> DB: Query books\nmatching criteria
activate DB

DB --> BMS: Return search results
deactivate DB

BMS --> SI: Display search results
deactivate BMS

SI --> S: Show list of books\nmatching criteria
deactivate SI

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Student to Search Interface**: The student starts the process by inputting search criteria (like title, author, subject category, publication date) into the search interface. This step initiates the library book search process.

2. **Search Interface to Book Management System**: The search interface then sends these criteria to the book management system, which is responsible for handling book-related operations, including searches based on given parameters.

3. **Book Management System to Database**: The book management system processes the request by querying the database to find books that match the search criteria provided by the student.

4. **Database to Book Management System**: The database returns the result set, which includes all books that match the search criteria, to the book management system.

5. **Book Management System to Search Interface**: The book management system processes the results, possibly formatting or filtering them according to the needs of the interface or any predefined rules (like sorting by relevance, publication date, etc.), and sends the formatted list back to the search interface.

6. **Search Interface to Student**: Finally, the search interface displays the list of books matching the criteria to the student, completing the search operation.

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the basic flow for a student searching for books within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) and can be adapted or extended depending on additional requirements or system complexity.

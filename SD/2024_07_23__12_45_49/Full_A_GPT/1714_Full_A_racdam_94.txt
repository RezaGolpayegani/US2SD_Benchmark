The following is a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format depicting the process of how an administrator might create user groups in order to control user permissions within the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project. This sequence includes interactions between the administrator, the user management system, and the database.

Please note, Plant UML code is designed to be rendered by a Plant UML processor or compatible tool. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "User Management\nSystem" as ums
database "Database" as db

admin -> ums: Login(credentials)
ums -> db: Validate credentials
db -> ums: Authentication Success
ums --> admin: Display Dashboard

activate admin
admin -> ums: Navigate to "User Groups" Section
ums --> admin: Show "User Groups" Page

admin -> ums: Click "Create User Group"
ums --> admin: Show "Create User Group" Form

admin -> ums: Submit "New Group" Details(Name, Permissions)
ums -> db: Create New User Group
db --> ums: Confirmation (Group Created)

ums --> admin: Display Confirmation Message
deactivate admin

@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the following steps:
1. **Login**: The administrator logs into the User Management System with their credentials.
2. **Navigate to User Groups Section**: Once logged in, the administrator navigates to the "User Groups" section of the system.
3. **Create User Group**: The administrator selects the option to create a new user group.
4. **Submit New Group Details**: The administrator fills out the form with the new user group's name and permissions and submits it.
5. **Confirmation**: The User Management System creates the new user group with the specified details in the database and returns a confirmation message to the administrator.

This sequence assumes a direct interaction model, with the User Management System acting as the intermediary between the administrator and the database, executing tasks based on administrator input and providing feedback based on the outcome of operations within the database.

Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story using PlantUML requires laying out the interactions between the system components involved in fulfilling the restaurant manager's request to see the total number of different drinks to gauge popularity. Here's how the sequence diagram might be structured:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as B
database "Database" as DB

M -> UI : Request drink popularity data
UI -> B : Get total counts for each drink
B -> DB : Query drink order counts
DB -> B : Return counts data
B -> UI : Display data with counts
UI -> M : Show drink popularity statistics
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram steps:

1. **Manager Request**: The restaurant manager initiates the process by requesting the popularity data of different drinks through the UI Dashboard. This is the user interaction kick-starting the process.

2. **UI to Backend Request**: The UI Dashboard forwards this request to the Backend Server to fetch the necessary data. The UI acts as the intermediary between the user and the server-side logic.

3. **Backend Server Queries Database**: The Backend Server then formulates a query to retrieve the total order counts for each type of drink from the Database. This involves a database operation fetching aggregated data based on the drink entities stored.

4. **Database Returns Data**: The Database processes the query and returns the aggregated counts data for each drink to the Backend Server. The data structure returned usually involves key-value pairs of drink types and their respective counts.

5. **Backend to UI Response**: With the data received from the Database, the Backend Server processes and potentially formats the data before sending it back to the UI Dashboard. This processed data is ready for display and interpretation by the user.

6. **UI Displays Popularity Statistics**: The UI Dashboard receives the drink popularity data and displays it to the restaurant manager in a human-readable or graphical format, allowing the manager to easily understand the popularity of different drinks.

This sequence facilitates the manager's goal to see the total number of different drinks sold, providing insight into their popularity.

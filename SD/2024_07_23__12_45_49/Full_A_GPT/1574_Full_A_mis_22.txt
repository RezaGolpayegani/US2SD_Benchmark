To fulfill the request of generating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story where a "repoadmin" wishes to have the license recorded in metadata and displayed alongside the item, here's a basic approach. Please note that for the sake of simplicity, certain assumptions about the underlying technology and interactions are made. You might need to adjust the sequence based on the actual architecture of your Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Repoadmin
participant UserInterface
participant AuthorizationService
participant MetadataService
participant Database
participant DisplayService

Repoadin -> UserInterface: Request to add/update item with license
UserInterface -> AuthorizationService: Validate request
AuthorizationService --> UserInterface: Request approved

UserInterface -> MetadataService: Update metadata with license
MetadataService -> Database: Record License in Item Metadata
Database --> MetadataService: Metadata Updated

MetadataService --> UserChannel: Notify metadata update success

UserInterface -> DisplayService: Request item display with metadata
DisplayService -> Database: Fetch item and metadata
Database --> DisplayService: Return item and metadata
DisplayService --> UserInterface: Display item with license
UserInterface --> Repoadmin: Show item and license

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Repoadmin to UserInterface**: The repository administrator (repoadin) initiates a request through the user interface to add a new item to the repository or update an existing item with license information.

2. **UserInterface to AuthorizationService**: The User Interface forwards this request to the Authorization Service to validate if the repoadmin is authorized to perform this action.

3. **AuthorizationService to UserInterface**: The Authorization Service confirms that the request is approved and informs the User Interface.

4. **UserInterface to MetadataService**: The User Interface then requests the Metadata Service to update the item's metadata with the new license information.

5. **MetadataService to Database**: The Metadata Service processes this request and updates the item's metadata in the database, recording the license information accordingly.

6. **Database to MetadataService**: The Database confirms that the metadata has been successfully updated.

7. **MetadataService to UserInterface**: The Metadata Service notifies the User Interface that the metadata update has been successful.

8. **UserInterface to DisplayService**: Next, the User Interface requests the Display Service to fetch the updated item along with its metadata for display.

9. **DisplayService to Database**: The Display Service queries the Database to fetch the requested item and its metadata, including the license information.

10. **Database to DisplayService**: The Database returns the requested item and its metadata to the Display Service.

11. **DisplayService to UserInterface**: The Display Service sends the item and its metadata, including the license information, to the User Interface for display.

12. **UserInterface to Repoadmin**: Finally, the User Interface displays the item along with its license information to the repoadmin.

This sequence diagram outlines the interaction between various components of the EDRMS from the moment a repository administrator initiates a request to have a license recorded in an item's metadata to the point where this information is successfully displayed alongside the item.

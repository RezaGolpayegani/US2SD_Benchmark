Sure, I'll provide a PlantUML sequence diagram for the described user story: "As a Website user, I want to access published FABS files, so that I can see the new files as they come in." This sequence diagram will focus on the interaction between the website user and the system components involved in accessing the newly published FABS files.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Website User" as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "FABS File Service" as fabs
participant "Database" as db

user -> web : Request to access FABS files
web -> auth : Validate User Session
auth -> web : User Session Valid
web -> fabs : Request latest FABS files
fabs -> db : Query for new FABS files
db -> fabs : Return list of new FABS files
fabs -> web : Display new FABS files
web -> user : Show the latest FABS files
@enduml
```

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **User Initiates Request:** The "Website User" requests access to published FABS files through the platform's "Web Interface."
2. **Session Validation:** The "Web Interface" then checks with the "Authentication Service" to validate the current user session, ensuring that the request is made by an authenticated user.
3. **Valid Session:** The "Authentication Service" confirms the session is valid and notifies the "Web Interface."
4. **Request for FABS Files:** Subsequently, the "Web Interface" requests the latest published FABS files from the "FABS File Service."
5. **Query Database:** The "FABS File Service" performs a query against the "Database" to retrieve the newest FABS files based on the publication date or any other predefined criteria suitable for identifying new entries.
6. **Files Retrieved:** The "Database" returns a list of the new FABS files available to the "FABS File Service."
7. **Display Files:** The "FABS File Service" then sends this list back to the "Web Interface."
8. **Show to User:** Finally, the "Web Interface" presents the list of newly published FABS files to the "Website User" to view.

This sequence diagram outlines the primary interactions and flow of information triggered by a website user's request to access newly published F_CSS files, assuming authenticated access and the presence of a service dedicated to managing and serving FABS files.

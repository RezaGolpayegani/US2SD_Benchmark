Creating a detailed sequence diagram for integrating Twitter Tweets into the Neurohub platform involves showcasing the interaction between the user, Twitter API, Neurohub, and possibly an intermediary service or module designed for fetching and displaying Tweets. The given user story does not detail specific mechanisms for authentication, fetching, or display within Neurohub, so the sequence diagram will include assumed processes based on common practices for integrating third-party content into a platform.

Below is a basic outline for a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that interprets this integration:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Twitter API" as Twitter
participant "Authorization Module" as Auth
participant "Tweet Fetching Service" as Fetch
participant "Neurohub Interface" as Neurohub

User->Neurohub: Log in to Neurohub
activate Neurohub
Neurohub->User: Display Dashboard

User->Neurohub: Request to link Twitter account
Neurohub->Auth: Initiate authentication process
activate Auth
Auth->User: Request Twitter authentication
User->Twitter: Provide authentication
activate Twitter
Twitter->Auth: Confirm authentication
deactivate Twitter

Auth->Neurohub: Authentication successful
deactivate Auth
Neurohub->Fetch: Set up Twitter Fetch service for User
activate Fetch
Fetch->Twitter: Request recent Tweets by User
activate Twitter
Twitter->Fetch: Return Tweets
deactivate Twitter

Fetch->Neurohub: Display Tweets in Neurohub
Neurohub->User: Show Twitter feed in Dashboard
deactivate Neurohub

This sequence diagram follows a general flow based on the user story provided:

1. **User Login and Dashboard Display**: The user logs into Neurohub and views their dashboard.
2. **Twitter Account Linking**: The user initiates the process to link their Twitter account to Neurohub for displaying their Tweets.
3. **Authentication**: An assumed authorization module facilitates OAuth authentication (or a similar mechanism) to authorize Neurohub to access the user's Tweets.
4. **Fetching and Displaying Tweets**: Upon successful authentication, a service within Neurohub is set up to fetch recent Tweets from the user's Twitter account. These Tweets are then displayed within the Neurohub interface, such as on the user's dashboard or a dedicated feed page.

This diagram is a starting point and can be expanded or modified based on the specific technical architecture of Neurohub, the details of the Twitter integration mechanism (e.g., scheduled fetching, real-time updates), and any additional requirements or constraints of the project.

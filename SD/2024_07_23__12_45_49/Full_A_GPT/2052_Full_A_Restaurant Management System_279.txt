Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to create customer orders so that I can tell the chef" involves visualizing the series of interactions between the waiter, the system, and potentially other components such as the order management system and the kitchen (chef). 

Below is a simple representation of how such a sequence diagram could look in PlantUML format. Note that this is a basic example to illustrate the process. The actual implementation might involve more complex interactions, especially in a real-world application with multiple layers of functionality.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Waiter
participant "Order Management\nSystem" as OMS
participant "Kitchen System" as Kitchen
database "Database" as DB

== Create Order Sequence ==
Waiter -> OMS : Select "Create New Order"
OMS -> Waiter : Display Menu Items
Waiter -> OMS : Choose Items &\nSpecify Details
OMS -> DB : Save Order Details
DB --> OMS : Confirm Save
OMS -> Kitchen : Send Order
Kitchen --> OMS : Acknowledge
OMS -> Waiter : Display Order Status

### Explaining the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Select "Create New Order"**: The sequence begins with the waiter initiating the creation of a new customer order through the Order Management System (OMS).

2. **Display Menu Items**: The OMS responds by displaying the available menu items to the waiter.

3. **Choose Items & Specify Details**: The waiter selects the desired menu items based on the customer's request and specifies any special instructions or modifications.

4. **Save Order Details**: The OMS sends the order details to be saved in the database. This includes the selected items, any special instructions, and the table number or customer identification.

5. **Confirm Save**: The database confirms that the order details have been successfully saved.

6. **Send Order**: The OMS sends the order to the kitchen system, which is responsible for communicating the order details to the kitchen staff, including the chef.

7. **Acknowledge**: The kitchen system acknowledges receipt of the order to the OMS.

8. **Display Order Status**: Finally, the OMS updates the waiter on the status of the order, confirming that it has been sent to the kitchen and is in progress.

This sequence diagram simplifies the complexity of a restaurant management system by focusing on the core interaction involved in creating and sending a customer order from a waiter to the chef through the necessary systems.

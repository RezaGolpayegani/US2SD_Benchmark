Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an owner, I want to see the consumption rates of the foods based on the past orders so I can make the order for these foods in advance" involves illustrating the sequence of operations between objects in the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Below is a representation in PlantUML language that outlines this process. 

Please note, this sequence diagram assumes a simplified model where the owner interacts with a dashboard interfacing with backend services to fetch historical order data, analyze consumption rates, and potentially prepare orders for suppliers.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Owner
participant Dashboard
participant BackendService
participant Database
participant AnalyticsEngine
participant SupplierOrderService

Owner -> Dashboard : Select "View Consumption Rates"
Dashboard -> BackendService : Request historical order data
BackendKService -> Database : Fetch historical order data
Database -> BackendService : Return order data
BackendService -> Dashboard : Provide data on past orders
Dashboard -> Owner : Display past orders

Owner -> Dashboard : Request consumption analysis
Dashboard -> AnalyticsEngine : Analyze consumption rates
AnalyticsEngine -> Database : Retrieve specific food order data
Database -> AnalyticsEngine : Return food order data
AnalyticsEngine -> Dashboard : Send consumption rate analysis
Dashboard -> Owner : Show consumption rates

Owner -> Dashboard : Decide to order based on rates
Dashboard -> Owner : Confirm order details
Owner -> Dashboard : Confirm and place order
Dashboard -> SupplierOrderService : Place order for foods
SupplierOrderService -> Database : Log order details
Database -> SupplierOrderService : Confirm order logged

SupplierOrderService -> SupplierOrderService : Send order to supplier
SupplierOrderService -> Dashboard : Confirm order with supplier
Dashboard -> Owner : Show order confirmation

This sequence diagram represents the interactions starting from the ownerâ€™s desire to see consumption rates, making decisions based on the data, and eventually placing an order to the suppliers for the required foods in advance. The process flows from the owner's interaction with the dashboard, to services performing analytics on historical data, and ends with an order placement confirmed by the supplier.

The key points covered in this diagram include:
- Requesting and displaying historical order data.
- Analyzing consumption rates based on past orders.
- Deciding and placing an order for foods with a supplier through the system.

This simplifies the actual complexities within each operation, such as the specific algorithms for analyzing consumption rates or the interaction protocols with suppliers. For a real-world application, each of these steps would need to be detailed further, considering security, data integrity, and error handling mechanisms.

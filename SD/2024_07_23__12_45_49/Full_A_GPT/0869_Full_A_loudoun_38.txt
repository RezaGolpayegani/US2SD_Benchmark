Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a Plan Review Staff member, I want to successfully conduct a Plan Review Meeting with the applicant and record the outcome, so that I can listen to it again," involves illustrating the interactions between different system components and actors involved in scheduling, conducting, and recording outcomes of a plan review meeting. Here is how the sequence diagram in PlantUML format could look:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Plan Review Staff" as staff
actor Applicant
entity "Meeting Scheduler" as scheduler
database "Application Database" as db
entity "Meeting Platform" as platform
database "Recording Storage" as storage

staff -> scheduler : Request Plan Review Meeting
scheduler -> db : Check Applicant's Data
db -> scheduler : Confirm Details
scheduler -> Applicant : Schedule Meeting Invitation
Applicant -> scheduler : Confirm Meeting
scheduler -> platform : Initiate Meeting Setup
platform -> db : Register Meeting Details
db -> platform : Meeting Scheduled

staff -> platform : Conduct Plan Review Meeting
platform -> Applicant : Join Plan Review Meeting
platform -> storage : Start Recording

Applicant -> staff : Discuss Plan
staff -> Applicant : Provide Feedback

platform -> storage : Stop Recording
storage -> platform : Save Recording Details
platform -> db : Update Meeting Outcome
db -> platform : Confirmation
platform -> staff : Meeting & Recording Saved
staff -> storage : Access Recording If Needed

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in the process from requesting a plan review meeting by the Plan Review Staff to conducting the meeting with the Applicant, recording the meeting, and saving the outcome for future access. It introduces the primary actors (Plan Review Staff and Applicant), the systems/components they interact with (Meeting Scheduler, Meeting Platform, Application Database, and Recording Storage), and the flow of actions and information between them.

1. It begins with the Plan Review Staff requesting a plan review meeting through the Meeting Scheduler.
2. The Meeting Scheduler checks the Applicant's data in the Application Database and confirms the details for scheduling.
3. An invitation is sent to the Applicant to schedule the meeting, and once confirmed, the Meeting Platform initiates the meeting setup.
4. Details of the scheduled meeting are registered in the Application Database.
5. The Plan Review Meeting is conducted via the Meeting Platform, which records the session.
6. During the meeting, discussions and feedback are exchanged between the staff and the Applicant.
7. After the meeting, the recording is stopped, saved in the Recording Storage, and the meeting outcome is updated in the Application Database.
8. The Plan Review Staff can access the recording if needed in the future.

This sequence aims to capture the essence of automating the Plan Review Meeting and recording process in a clear and structured manner, which can be further adjusted or elaborated upon based on specific system requirements and functionality.

Given the complexity of interactions outlined in the user story, the sequence diagram will capture the key processes and components involved in checking the submitted files for format specification compliance, validity, and well-formedness, and then alerting the depositor about the status.

Below is a PlantUML representation of the sequence diagram for the described user story. It assumes the presence of several system components such as the `Depositor Interface`, `Ingest Service`, `Validation Service`, `Notification Service`, and the `Depositor` as the actor.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor as depositor
participant "Depositor Interface" as UI
participant "Ingest Service" as Ingest
participant "Validation Service" as Validation
participant "Notification Service" as Notification

depositor -> UI : Submit Files
activate UI

UI -> Ingest : Ingest Files
activate Ingest

Ingest -> Validation : Validate Files
activate Validation

alt Files are invalid or not well-formed
    Validation -> Depositor : Alert: Files Invalid/Not Well-Formed
else Files are valid
    Validation -> Ingest : Proceed with Ingestion
    Ingest -> Notification : Generate Success Notification
    Notification -> Depositor : Alert: Files Successfully Ingested
end

deactivate Validation
deactivate Ingest
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram begins with the `Depositor` submitting files through the `Depositor Interface`. The files are then ingested by the `Ingest Service`, which forwards them to the `Validation Service` for checking their conformity to format specifications, validity, and well-formedness.

- If the files do not meet the required standards (are invalid or not well-formed), the `Validation Service` directly alerts the `Depositor` of the issues found.
- If the files are deemed valid, the `Validation Service` notifies the `Ingest Service` to proceed with the ingestion. Upon successful ingestion, the `Notification Service` generates a success notification, which is then sent to the `Depositor`.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and can be further detailed based on specific implementation details, such as the method of alert (e.g., email, SMS, dashboard notification), the detailed steps of file validation, and the exact components involved in each service.

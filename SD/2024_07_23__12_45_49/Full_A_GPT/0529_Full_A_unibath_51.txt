To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format, we shall depict the interactions involved when an academic publisher wants to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets within the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform.

Given the project description, let's assume the following key processes occur:

1. **Academic Publisher Submission** - An academic publisher submits a request to link an article to a dataset.
2. **DOI Minting** - For the dataset to be linked, a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is minted if not already present.
3. **Link Creation** - A persistent link between the article and the dataset is created using the DOI.
4. **Verification** - The system verifies the link for integrity and compliance.
5. **Confirmation** - The academic publisher receives a confirmation of the successful linkage.
6. **Notification** - Relevant stakeholders are notified of the new link for visibility and access.

Here's how the sequence might be outlined in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AcademicPublisher as AP
participant WebInterface as WI
participant DataManager as DM
participant DOIService as DOI
participant VerificationService as VS
participant NotificationService as NS

AP -> WI : Submit link request (Article ID, Dataset ID)
WI -> DM : Check if DOI exists for Dataset ID
alt DOI exists
    DM -> DM : Retrieve existing DOI
else DOI not exists
    DM -> DOI : Request DOI minting for Dataset
    DOI -> DM : DOI minted and returned
end
DM -> WI : DOI for Dataset Retrieved/Generated
WI -> AP : Show DOI, request confirmation to create link
AP -> WI : Confirm link creation
WI -> VS : Verify link integrity and compliance
VS -> VS : Perform verification checks
VS -> WI : Verification Successful
WI -> DM : Create persistent link (Article DOI, Dataset DOI)
DM -> NS : Notify stakeholders of link creation
NS -> AP : Send confirmation and details of link creation
AP <- NS : Receive notifications (as applicable)

This sequence diagram represents the flow from the academic publisher's request to the final creation and confirmation of a persistent link between an article and a dataset, including interactions with different system components such as the web interface, data manager, DOI service, verification service, and notification service.

It considers necessary checks for existing DOIs, the minting of new DOIs where necessary, and the verification of link integrity and compliance before the final creation of the link. This sequence ensures robust, high-quality research linkage as desired by the academic publisher.

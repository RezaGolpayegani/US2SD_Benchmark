Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to search the books based the on their names so that I can check the availability of the book" involves illustrating the interactions between the librarian, the front-end interface of the library management system, the back-end server, and the database. Here's a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "CLMS Frontend" as Frontend
participant "CLMS Backend Server" as Backend
database "Library Database" as Database

Librarian -> Frontend : Enters book name in search
Frontend -> Backend : Sends search query with book name
Backend -> Database : Query book details by name
Database -> Backend : Returns book details and availability status
Backend -> Frontend : Sends search results to display
Frontend -> Librarian : Displays book details and availability

```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram steps:

1. **Librarian initiates the search**: This step represents the librarian entering the book name into the search field on the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) frontend interface.
   
2. **Frontend communicates with Backend**: The CLMS frontend sends the search query, including the book name, to the backend server. This step is crucial as it initiates the backend's process of retrieving information.
   
3. **Backend queries the Database**: Upon receiving the query from the frontend, the CLMS backend server processes the search request and queries the library database for the book details by the name provided.
   
4. **Database returns book details**: The library database responds to the backend's request by returning the details of the book, including its availability status. This step involves accessing the stored data and is key to providing accurate information to the librarian.
   
5. **Backend sends search results to the Frontend**: The backend server then sends the information retrieved from the database back to the frontend interface. This includes compiling the data into a readable format for display.
   
6. **Frontend displays book details and availability**: Finally, the search results, including the book details and its availability status, are displayed to the librarian on the CLMS frontend interface. This enables the librarian to check the availability of the book as required.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction and flow of information between the different actors and systems involved when a librarian searches for a book by name to check its availability in the Comprehensive Library Management System.

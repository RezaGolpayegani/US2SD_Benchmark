To generate a PlantUML code snippet for a detailed sequence diagram based on the user story "As a user, I want to be able to view a map display of the public recycling bins around my area," follow the structured outline below. The diagram will depict the interactions between the system components from the user's request to the display of the public recycling bins on a map.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor User as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Application Server" as server
database "Recycling Data" as database
participant "Google Maps API" as maps


user -> web : Request map display of recycling bins
web -> server : Fetch recycling bin locations for area
server -> database : Query public recycling bins by area
database --> server : Return recycling bins data
server -> maps : Request map with markers for bins
maps --> server : Respond with map view
server --> web : Return map view to display
web -> user : Display map with recycling bins

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **User Interaction:** The sequence begins with the user requesting to view a map display of the public recycling bins in their area through the web interface. This denotes the starting point of the process, highlighting user initiative.

2. **Request Processing:** Upon receiving the user's request, the web interface communicates with the application server to retrieve information about the recycling bin locations specific to the user's area.

3. **Data Retrieval:** The application server queries the recycling data database for public recycling bins information based on the area specified. The recycling data database processes this query and returns the relevant data to the application server.

4. **Maps API Integration:** With the recycling bins data in hand, the application server then interacts with the Google Maps API (or a similar mapping service) requesting a map with markers for the recycling bins. The Google Maps API processes this request and provides a map view tailored to the application server's request.

5. **Displaying Results to User:** Lastly, the application server transmits the map view back to the web interface, which then displays it to the user. This final step visually represents the public recycling bins on a map, accomplishing the user's original request.

This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of interactions and data between different components of the RecycleSmart Platform and external services (like Google Maps API) to fulfill a userâ€™s request to view a map display of public recycling bins in their area.

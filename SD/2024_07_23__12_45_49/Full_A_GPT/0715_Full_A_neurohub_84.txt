Given the scope of your request, creating a detailed sequence diagram involving the process of a researcher attaching metadata to data and entries within the Neurohub platform encompasses various components. Here's a simplified breakdown in PlantUML format. 

This diagram assumes the process involves a researcher uploading data, the system prompting for metadata, the researcher submitting the metadata, and the system confirming the successful attachment of metadata.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as r
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Metadata Service" as meta
participant "Data Storage" as storage
participant "Confirmation Service" as confirm

== Attach Metadata to a Data Entry ==
r -> web: Select data for upload
web -> storage: Upload data
activate storage
storage --> web: Data upload successful
deactivate storage

web -> r: Prompt for metadata input
r -> web: Provide metadata details
web -> meta: Send metadata
activate meta
meta --> web: Metadata processed
deactivate meta

web -> storage: Link metadata to data
activate storage
storage --> web: Metadata attached successfully
deceive storage

web -> confirm: Request confirmation message
activate confirm
confirm --> web: Generate confirmation
deactivate confirm

web -> r: Display confirmation message

This sequence diagram outlines the general interaction flow without diving into deeper system-specific details, like authentication or error handling, which can add additional complexity. It focuses on the primary interactions related to attaching metadata to a data entry within the Neurohub platform. Depending on the actual system architecture and requirements, there might be the need to refine or expand the diagram to include more detailed steps or components (e.g., a separate authentication service, error handling flows, etc.).

To provide a sequence diagram relevant to the user story encapsulated in the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT) project, concerning XHTML and CSS standards compliance, we'll focus on the process a developer might follow to ensure these standards are adhered to. This process will include steps like coding, validating, and reviewing the site against the XHTML and CSS standards.

**PlantUML Sequence Diagram: Ensuring XHTML and CSS Compliance**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant IDE
participant ValidatorService
participant Reviewer

Developer -> IDE: Write XHTML and CSS
IDE -> Developer: Highlight non-compliance (real-time)
Developer -> IDE: Adjust code to comply
Developer -> ValidatorService: Submit code for validation
ValidatorService -> ValidatorService: Validate against standards
alt Valid Code
    ValidatorService -> Developer: Return success message
else Non-Compliant Code
    ValidatorService -> Developer: Return error details
    Developer -> IDE: Correct errors
    loop Until compliant
        Developer -> ValidatorService: Resubmit code for validation
        ValidatorService -> ValidatorService: Revalidate against standards
    end
    ValidatorService -> Developer: Return success message
end
Developer -> Reviewer: Request review for compliance and accessibility
Reviewer -> Reviewer: Review code and site accessibility
alt Review Passed
    Reviewer -> Developer: Approve compliance and accessibility
else Review Feedback
    Reviewer -> Developer: Provide feedback for improvement
    loop Based on feedback
        Developer -> IDE: Adjust code
        Developer -> ValidatorService: Validate adjustments
        ValidatorQueue -> Developer: Validation result
        Developer -> Reviewer: Resubmit for review
    end
    Reviewer -> Developer: Approve compliance and accessibility
end

**Explanation of the Diagram:**

- **Developer and IDE:** The developer writes or edits XHTML and CSS code in their Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which may provide real-time feedback on compliance with standards.
- **ValidatorService:** The developer submits their code to a validation service that checks for adherence to XHTML and CSS standards. If the code is non-compliant, the service returns details of the discrepancies, prompting the developer to make necessary corrections.
- **Reviewer:** Once the validation service confirms compliance, the developer requests a review from a peer or a compliance reviewer. The review includes not only standard compliance but also examines the site's accessibility features.

This sequence emphasizes the iterative nature of achieving standard compliance and accessibility, involving writing the code, validating it against standards, and undergoing peer review. It mirrors a typical development workflow aiming to maximize compatibility and reach of a web application like AEPT.

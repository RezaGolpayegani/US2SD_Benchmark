To depict the user story of a researcher wanting to have a group-level repository for sharing papers, reviews, and comments with other researchers in the form of a sequence diagram using Plant UML, consider the following simplified example. This sequence diagram assumes an interaction where a researcher uploads a document, adds metadata/reviews, and then shares it with the group. Note that the actual implementation details can be more complex and may require authentication, error handling, and other considerations.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Neurohub API" as api
database "Group Repository" as repo

== Upload Document ==
res -> web : Select document to upload
web -> api : Upload request (document)
api -> repo : Save document
repo --> api : Acknowledgement
api --> web : Upload success
web --> res : Display success message

== Add Metadata/Review ==
res -> web : Add metadata/review
web -> api : Submit metadata/review
api -> repo : Update document details
repo --> api : Acknowledgement
api --> web : Update success
web --> res : Display success message

== Share with Group ==
res -> web : Share document request
web -> api : Share document (group ID)
api -> repo : Update access control
repo --> api : Acknowledgement
api --> web : Sharing success
web --> res : Display success message

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation. Here are some key aspects of it:

1. **Researcher Actions (Actor)**: This is the user or actor initiating actions, such as uploading documents, adding metadata/reviews, and sharing documents with a group.

2. **Web Interface (Participant)**: Acts as the intermediary for user interactions. It receives requests from the researcher and communicates with the Neurohub API.

3. **Neurohub API (Participant)**: Processes requests from the web interface, handling the logic for uploading, updating, and sharing documents within the group repository.

4. **Group Repository (Database)**: This is where documents, metadata, reviews, and access controls are stored. It responds to API requests to store, update, and manage documents.

Remember, depending on the project specifics, you might need to adjust the diagram to include additional steps, such as authentication (login/logout), error handling mechanisms, and detailed interactions for metadata and review management. Also, elaborate on the integration points with other systems if such interactions are necessary for the project scenario described.

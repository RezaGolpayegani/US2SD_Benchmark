Given the complexity of developing a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story described, here's a basic PlantUML code outline highlighting the process for a Planning Staff member to conduct and track plan amendments and planning studies. This example assumes interactions between the user (Planning Staff member), the Portal Interface, and various backend systems like the Planning Module and Database for managing and recording the plan amendments and planning activities.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Planning Staff" as PS
participant "Portal Interface" as PI
participant "Planning Module" as PM
participant "Database" as DB

== Conduct Plan Amendments & Studies ==
PS -> PI : Access Planning Section
activate PI
PI -> PM : Request Plan Amendment/Study Forms
activate PM
PM -> DB : Fetch Forms and Requirements
activate DB
DB --> PM : Return Forms and Data
deactivate DB
PM --> PI : Display Forms and Requirements
PI --> PS : Show Forms and Instructions
deactivate PM
PS -> PI : Submit Filled Forms & Documentation
activate PI
PI -> PM : Process Submission
activate PM
PM -> DB : Save New Amendment/Study
activate DB
DB --> PM : Confirm Save
deactivate DB
PM --> PI : Acknowledge Submission
PI --> PS : Show Submission Success

== Track Plan Amendments & Studies ==
PS -> PI : Request Status of Amendments/Studies
activate PI
PI -> PM : Query Amendment/Study Status
activate PM
PM -> DB : Fetch Status Information
activate DB
DB --> PM : Return Status Data
deactivate DB
PM --> PI : Provide Status Update
PI --> PS : Display Current Status
deactivate PM
deactivate PI

This diagram is a simplified overview and can be modified or expanded based on the specific requirements, data fields, and user interactions defined for the County Services & Property Information Portal project. For instance, additional steps could be included to account for communication with other stakeholders, integration with GIS systems for location-based information, or functionality for creating detailed reports about the plan amendments and planning studies.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the stated user story in PlantUML format involves depicting the interactions specifically for a repository manager indicating subjects related to an object within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS). Below is a sequence diagram that captures this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as UI
participant "Object Management Module" as OMM
participant "Subjects Management" as SM
participant "Database" as DB

RM -> UI: Select object to update
activate UI

UI -> OMM: Request object details
activate OMM

OMM -> DB: Query object information
activate DB

DB --> OMM: Return object details
deactivate DB

OMM --> UI: Display object details
deactivate OMM

RM -> UI: Indicate updating subjects
activate UI

UI -> SM: Request current subjects
activate SM

SM -> DB: Retrieve existing subjects
activate DB

DB --> SM: Return existing subjects list
deactivate DB

SM --> UI: Display subjects for modification
deactivate SM

RM -> UI: Add/remove subjects
activate UI

UI -> SM: Update subjects list
activate SM

SM -> DB: Save updated subjects
activate DB

DB --> SM: Confirm subjects updated
deactivate DB

SM --> UI: Acknowledge successful update
UI --> RM: Display update confirmation
deactivate SM
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram starts with the repository manager selecting an object to update in the DAMS interface and follows the process through to the indication of related subjects and the confirmation of this update. This visualization serves to illustrate the step-by-step interaction between the repository manager, the DAMS interface, specific backend modules (Object Management Module and Subjects Management), and the database, culminating in the successful update of related subjects for a digital object within the system.

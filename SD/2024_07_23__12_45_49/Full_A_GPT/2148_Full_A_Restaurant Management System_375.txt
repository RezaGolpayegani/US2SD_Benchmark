Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML for the specified user story requires outlining interactions between the system components involved in viewing the total queue of orders with table numbers and time ordered from an employee's perspective. Please note that the actual implementation details may vary based on your system's design, and this sequence outlines a simplified generic process.

First, ensure you have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

title Employee Viewing Total Queue of Orders

actor Employee
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

== Display Order Queue ==

Employee -> UI: Request to view orders
UI -> Backend: Fetch total queue of orders
Backend -> DB: Query order details (table numbers, time ordered)
DB --> Backend: Return order details
Backend --> UI: Display order details
UI --> Employee: Show total queue of orders with table numbers and time ordered

### Sequence Breakdown:

1. **Employee Initiates Request:** The sequence starts with the employee requesting to view the total queue of orders through the User Interface (UI).
   
2. **UI Requests Data from Backend:** The UI forwards this request to the Backend Service to fetch the required information.
   
3. **Backend Queries Database:** The Backend Service then queries the Database to retrieve details of all current orders, specifically looking for table numbers and the time each order was placed.
   
4. **Database Returns Order Details:** The Database processes the query and returns the requested details to the Backend Service.
   
5. **Backend Sends Data to UI:** With the order details retrieved, the Backend Service processes and formats this data, sending it back to the UI.
   
6. **UI Displays Total Queue of Orders to Employee:** Finally, the UI presents the total queue of orders, complete with table numbers and the time ordered, to the employee.
  
This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions involved in fulfilling an employee's request to view the total queue of orders. Depending on the complexity and specific requirements of your system, additional steps and components might be involved.

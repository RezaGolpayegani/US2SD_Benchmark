Creating a detailed sequence diagram to illustrate the user story about a library member wanting to pay contactively through an app can encapsulate several interactions among system components. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram example that outlines this process.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Mobile App" as app
participant "Payment System" as paymentSystem
database "Library Database" as database
participant "Notification Service" as notification

== Payment Process Initiation ==
member -> app: Selects fees/fines to pay
app -> paymentSystem: Initiates payment process

== Payment Authorization ==
paymentSystem -> member: Requests payment authorization
member -> paymentSystem: Authorizes payment

== Payment Processing ==
paymentSystem -> paymentSystem: Processes payment
paymentSystem -> database: Updates payment status

== Acknowledgement ==
database -> app: Confirms payment success
app -> member: Displays payment success message

== Notification ==
paymentSystem -> notification: Trigger payment confirmation notification
notification -> member: Sends payment confirmation

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Payment Process Initiation:** The library member selects fees or fines they wish to pay through the mobile app. This could be overdue fees, reservation fees, or other applicable charges.
   
2. **Payment Authorization:** The payment system requests authorization from the library member to proceed with the payment. This step is crucial for contactless payments to ensure user consent.

3. **Payment Processing:** After obtaining authorization, the payment system processes the payment. This involves verifying the payment details, confirming transaction success, and updating the library database with the new payment status.

4. **Acknowledgement:** Once the payment is successfully processed, the Library Database confirms the transaction's success back to the Mobile App, which then displays a payment success message to the library member.

5. **Notification:** The payment system triggers a notification to be sent to the library member confirming the payment. This could be done via email, SMS, or app notifications, providing an additional layer of confirmation for the transaction.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions involved when a library member wishes to pay fees or fines through an app, emphasizing the simplicity and effectiveness of contactless payments.

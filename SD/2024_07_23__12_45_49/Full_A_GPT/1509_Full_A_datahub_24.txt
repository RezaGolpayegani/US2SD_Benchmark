Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the provided user story involves illustrating the interactions between the system components and the user when the goal is to view a data package. This representation will cover the steps from the consumer's initial action to the system's response in allowing the consumer to preview a data package.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Consumer
participant "UI/CLI Interface" as Interface
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
database "Data Registry" as Registry
participant "Data Package Viewer" as Viewer

== Viewing Data Package Process ==

Consumer -> Interface: Request to view data package
Interface -> Auth: Validate consumer identity
Auth --> Interface: Identity confirmed

alt Successful Authentication
    Interface -> Registry: Request data package metadata
    Registry --> Interface: Data package metadata response
    Interface -> Viewer: Request to render data package preview
    Viewer --> Interface: Display data package preview
    Interface --> Consumer: Show data package details and preview
else Authentication Failed
    Interface --> Consumer: Display authentication error
end

```

### Explanation:

1. **Consumer Initiates Request:** The consumer interacts with the platform's UI or CLI interface to view a data packaging, signaling the start of the process.

2. **Authentication:** The interface requests authentication of the consumer's identity through the Authentication Service. This step ensures that only authorized users can view data package details, respecting privacy and access controls when necessary.

3. **Handle Authentication Outcome:**
   - **Successful Authentication:** If the consumer is successfully authenticated, the interface then requests the metadata of the desired data package from the Data Registry.
     - **Data Registry Response:** The Data Registry responds with the metadata of the data package, which includes details necessary to preview or understand the package's scope.
     - **Preview Data Package:** The interface, leveraging the Data Package Viewer, requests to render a preview based on the metadata. The Viewer processes this request and returns a visual or textual representation suitable for preview.
     - **Show Preview to Consumer:** Finally, the interface displays the data package details along with the preview to the consumer, allowing them to assess the relevance and utility of the dataset.
   - **Authentication Failed:** If the authentication fails, the interface directly informs the consumer about the authentication error, preventing access to data package details.

This sequence diagram provides a structured view of the interactions involved in viewing a data package on the Data Registry and Publishing Platform, emphasizing the importance of authentication and efficient data presentation. The flexibility of using either UI or CLI interfaces caters to varying preferences of consumers, while the validation and presentation processes ensure secure and informed access to data packages.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story – "As a web recruiter manager, I want to confirm the recruiter is set up and working properly, so that I can deploy it on more clients." – involves illustrating how various system components interact with each other to achieve the functionality of confirming a recruiter setup is correctly implemented before broader deployment.

Given the scope of this request and considering the generic nature of components involved in such setups, I'll extrapolate a sequence that might occur within the context of the NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative. This sequence will involve interactions with cloud infrastructure, CMS, and other technical components.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Web Recruiter Manager" as manager
participant "CMS (Content Management System)" as cms
participant "Beta Website Cloud Infrastructure" as cloud
participant "Recruiter Setup Service" as recruiter_service
participant "User Testing Platform" as user_test
database "Subdomain Configuration" as subdomain

== Confirm Setup ==
manager -> recruiter_service : Verify setup parameters
activate recruiter_service

recruiter_service -> cms : Fetch recruiter widget code
activate cms
cms -> recruiter_service : Return widget code
deactivate cms

recruiter_service -> cloud : Deploy recruiter to test page
activate cloud
cloud -> subdomain : Update DNS for test subdomain
activate subdomain
subdomain -> cloud : Confirm DNS update
deactivate subdomain
cloud -> recruiter_service : Confirm recruiter deployment
deactivate cloud

recruiter_service -> user_test : Initiate user testing
activate user_test
user_test -> user_test : Execute test scenarios
user_test -> recruiter_service : Provide test results
deactivate user_test

== Finalization ==
recruiter_service -> recruiter_service : Analyze results
recruiter_service -> manager : Report setup status
deactivate recruiter_service

== Deployment Decision ==
manager -> manager : Evaluate report
manager -> cloud : Authorize broader deployment \n(if successful)
activate cloud
cloud -> subdomain: Update DNS for live deployment
activate subdomain
subdomain --> cloud : Confirm live DNS setup
deactivate subdomain
cloud --> manager : Confirm live deployment
deactivate cloud

This sequence diagram starts with the Web Recruiter Manager requesting a verification of the recruiter setup parameters by the Recruiter Setup Service. The setup service then interacts with the CMS to fetch the necessary widget code and proceeds to deploy this on a test page within the cloud infrastructure. The infrastructure is responsible for handling DNS changes, including for test subdomains.

Following deployment, the Recruiter Setup Service initiates user testing to validate the implementation. Based on test results, the service analyzes the outcomes and reports the setup status back to the web recruiter manager. The manager reviews the report to make a final deployment decision. If the results are satisfactory, the manager authorizes broader deployment, which involves updating DNS settings for live deployment and confirming when this setup is live.

This is a high-level overview and might have to be adjusted based on the specific technologies and processes in use at the NSF beta website project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves outlining the steps a researcher takes to import metadata into the DMPTool, including the interactions between the user, the system, and any external metadata tools. Below is a PlantUML format sequence diagram representing this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant DMPTool
participant MetadataTool
participant ExternalSystemService

Researcher -> DMPTool: Request metadata import option
activate DMPTool

DMPTool -> MetadataTool: Invoke metadata retrieval API
activate MetadataTool
MetadataTool --> DMPTool: Return metadata
deactivate MetadataTool

DMPTool -> ExternalSystemService: Authenticate access
activate ExternalSystemService
ExternalSystemService --> DMPTool: Confirm authentication
deactivate ExternalSystemService

DMPTool -> DMPTool: Process and import metadata
DMPTool --> Researcher: Display imported metadata confirmation
deactivate DMPTool

@enduml
```

This diagram outlines a simple process flow:

1. **Request Metadata Import Option**: The researcher requests to import metadata into the DMPTool, initiating the process.
2. **Invoke Metadata Retrieval API**: The DMPTool contacts the external Metadata Tool's API (or service) to retrieve the metadata. This step assumes that the researcher has metadata stored or managed by a separate Metadata Tool that provides an API for data exchange.
3. **Authenticate Access**: The DMPTool may need to authenticate against the Metadata Tool or an external system to access the metadata securely. This is a crucial step to ensure that only authorized requests are processed, safeguarding the data integrity and privacy.
4. **Process and Import Metadata**: After the metadata is retrieved and authentication is confirmed, the DMPTool processes the metadata for compatibility (if necessary) and then imports it into the researcher's data management plan (DMP).
5. **Display Imported Metadata Confirmation**: Finally, the Researcher receives confirmation that the metadata has been successfully imported into their DMP on the DMPTool platform.

This diagram is a high-level representation and assumes direct communication between the DMPTool and a generic Metadata Tool. Depending on the specific external systems involved, additional steps or different flows might be necessary, especially concerning authentication and data processing.

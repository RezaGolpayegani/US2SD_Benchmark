To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see clock in and out information of employees" using PlantUML, we need to outline the flow of interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. The sequence will typically begin with the manager requesting the clock in/out information, which then involves interactions with the system's backend to fetch and finally display this information.

Here's how this sequence could be represented in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Server" as S
database "Employee Database" as DB

Manager -> MI : Selects "Employee Time Tracking"
activate MI
MI -> S : Request clock in/out information
activate S
S -> DB : Query employee clock in/out data
activate DB
DB --> S : Return data
deactivate DB
S --> MI : Clock in/out information
deactivate S
MI --> Manager : Display information
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

This diagram simplifies the process by focusing on the main components involved in the user story:

- **Manager**: Initiates the interaction by needing to view the employee time tracking information.
- **Management Interface (MI)**: The UI through which the manager interacts. This could be a web page or a mobile application screen dedicated to management functionalities.
- **Server (S)**: It represents the server-side logic handled by Node.js with Express, in charge of processing requests and interacting with other system components.
- **Employee Database (DB)**: Stores all employee-related data, including clock in and out timestamps.

The sequence:

1. The **Manager** selects the option to view "Employee Time Tracking" through the Management Interface.
2. The **Management Interface** sends a request to the **Server** to fetch the clock in/out information.
3. The **Server** queries the **Employee Database** for the requested data.
4. The **Employee Database** returns the clock in/out data to the **Server**.
5. The **Server** processes and sends this information back to the **Management Interface**.
6. The **Management Interface** finally displays the clock in/out information to the **Manager**.

This PlantUML sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions involved in fulfilling the manager's request to see the clock in and out information of employees within the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

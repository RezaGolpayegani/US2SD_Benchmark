Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML requires defining the sequence of interactions between actors and system components when a Publisher wants to permanently delete a data package. Below is a PlantUML code representing this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "UI Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "API Gateway" as API
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
participant "Data Management Service" as DataService
participant "Storage" as Storage
participant "Cache" as Cache

Publisher -> Dashboard: Selects data package for deletion
Dashboard -> API: Request to delete data package (auth token, package_id)
API -> AuthService: Validate auth token
AuthService --> API: Token validity confirmed
API -> DataService: Delete data package request (package_id)
DataService -> Storage: Request permanent deletion (package_id)
Storage --> DataService: Confirm deletion
DataService -> Cache: Invalidate cache for deleted package
Cache --> DataService: Cache updated
DataService --> API: Deletion successful
API --> Dashboard: Display success message
Dashboard --> Publisher: Notify of successful deletion
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps in the data package deletion process by a Publisher:

1. **Publisher Selection**: The Publisher selects the data package they wish to delete through the UI Dashboard.
2. **Deletion Request**: The Dashboard sends a request to the back-end API to delete the selected data package, including the authentication token and the ID of the package to be deleted.
3. **Authentication**: The API Gateway forwards the token to the Authentication Service to validate the Publisher's identity and permissions.
4. **Permission Confirmation**: Upon confirmation of token validity, the API Gateway proceeds with the request and forwards it to the Data Management Service.
5. **Permanent Deletion Request**: The Data Management Service requests the permanent deletion of the data package from the Storage system.
6. **Cache Invalidation**: Following successful deletion in the Storage, the Data Management Service instructs the Cache system to invalidate any cached entries related to the deleted data package to ensure consistency.
7. **Success Notification**: The API Gateway receives confirmation of the deletion process and notifies the UI Dashboard, which in turn informs the Publisher that the data package has been successfully deleted.

This diagram assumes a microservices architecture where the Data Registry and Publishing Platform is comprised of separate components for handling user authentication, data management, and storage, reflecting a scalable and modular design.

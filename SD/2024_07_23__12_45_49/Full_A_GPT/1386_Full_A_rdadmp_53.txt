Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the provided user story requires breaking down the process into interactions between various system components and actors involved in the early information gathering about data volume for preservation. Below is a PlantUML code that represents these interactions, focusing on the archive manager's perspective in determining necessary storage infrastructure.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ArchiveManager as AM
participant "DMPTool" as DMT
participant "Repository API" as RAPI
participant "Data Manager" as DM
participant "IT System" as ITS

AM -> DMT : Request data volume information
DMT -> RAPI: Query planned data submissions
RAPI -> DMT: Return data submission estimates
DMT -> ITS: Request current storage capacity
ITS -> DMT: Return current storage capacity details
DMT -> DM: Request additional data preservation details
DM -> DMT: Provide data format, size, and period
DMT -> AM: Show comprehensive storage needs analysis

note over DMT, AM: Analysis includes\n- Data volume estimates\n- Current storage capacity\n- Required preservation duration\n- Data format and size details

AM -> ITS: Plan for storage expansion
note right of ITS: ITS plans infrastructure\nupdates based on analysis

ITS -> AM: Confirm storage infrastructure plan
AM -> DMT : Confirm storage planning completion

This sequence diagram begins with the Archive Manager (AM) requesting information about the volume of data that needs to be preserved. This triggers interactions between the DMPTool (DMT), a Repository API (RAPI), the Data Manager (DM), and the IT System (ITS). The process includes querying planned data submissions, checking current storage capacity, and obtaining additional data preservation details such as format, size, and expected preservation duration. Following this, the DMPTool compiles and presents a comprehensive analysis of storage needs to the Archive Manager. Based on this analysis, the IT System plans and confirms the necessary storage infrastructure adjustments.

Please note, this is a simplified sequence aimed at illustrating the connections and flow of actions according to the described user story. Depending on the specific functionality and flexibility of the DMPTool and the systems it interacts with, more detailed steps might be necessary, especially around authentication, error handling, and data validation.

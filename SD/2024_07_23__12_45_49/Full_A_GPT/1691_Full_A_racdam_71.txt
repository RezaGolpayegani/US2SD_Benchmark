Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story provided involves defining the various system components interacting during the process of a researcher requesting and receiving accurate cross-collection citation information. Note, to create a complete PlantUML diagram code, assumptions need to be made about specific system functionalities, not detailed in your project description.

```
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant UserInterface as UI
participant SearchSystem as Search
participant CitationGenerator as CG
participant Database as DB

Researcher -> UI : Enter search query\nand request citation
UI -> Search : Process query\nfor cross-collection items
Search -> DB : Fetch relevant items
DB --> Search : Return items
Search --> UI : Display search results
Researcher -> UI : Select item for citation
UI -> CG : Request citation for item
CG -> DB : Retrieve item details
DB --> CG : Return item details
CG --> UI : Provide formatted citation
UI --> Researcher : Display citation information

**Explanation of the Sequence:**

1. **Researcher**: Initiates the interaction by entering their search query in the User Interface (UI) with the intention of requesting citation information for specific materials across collections.

2. **UserInterface (UI)**: Acts as the mediator between the researcher and the backend systems. It processes the researcher's query and requests from the Search System to retrieve relevant items.

3. **SearchSystem (Search)**: Processes the query to fetch relevant materials across various collections. It interacts with the Database to retrieve the necessary items based on the search query.

4. **Database (DB)**: This is where all the archival information, including metadata for all collections, is stored. It processes requests from the Search System and returns the relevant items.

5. **CitationGenerator (CG)**: Once the researcher selects an item for citation, the UI requests the Citation Generator to create a formatted citation. The CG retrieves detailed item information from the Database necessary for generating the citation.

6. **Database (DB) returns item details to CG**: After fetching the required details from the database, the Citation Generator formats the citation according to the appropriate citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).

7. **UI displays the citation to the Researcher**: Finally, the formatted citation is displayed to the researcher through the UI, allowing them to accurately reference the material in their research.

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified version of the interactions involved in providing a researcher with accurate cross-collection citation information. Depending on the complexity of the digital archive management system, additional steps or components might be involved (e.g., authentication, error handling mechanisms, or usage tracking for analytics).

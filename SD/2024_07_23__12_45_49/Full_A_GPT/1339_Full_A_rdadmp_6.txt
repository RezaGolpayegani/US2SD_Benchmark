Generating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story involves representing interactions between the IT manager and various components of the DMPTool system in a way that illustrates the process of identifying IT resource requirements early in the project lifecycle. Below is a PlantUML code snippet to represent these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ITManager as IT
participant DMPToolInterface as UI
participant ProjectData as PD
participant ResourceEstimationTool as RE
participant ITResourceDatabase as DB

IT -> UI : Access DMPTool
UI -> PD : Request project details
PD -> UI : Return project details
UI -> IT : Display project details

IT -> UI : Request IT resource requirements
UI -> RE : Initiate resource estimation
RE -> PD : Fetch project specifics
PD -> RE : Return project specs
RE -> DB : Query historical resource usage
DB -> RE : Return historical data
RE -> RE : Calculate requirements
RE -> UI : Send estimation results
UI -> IT : Display IT resource requirements

IT -> UI : Plan for resource acquisition
UI -> IT : Provide acquisition guidance

```

This sequence diagram starts with the IT Manager (IT) accessing the DMPTool Interface (UI) to request and view project details. The IT Manager then asks for IT resource requirements, which prompts interactions between the DMPTool Interface, a Resource Estimation Tool (RE), and the IT Resource Database (DB) to calculate and return those requirements based on project specifics and historical data. Finally, the IT Manager uses the returned information to plan for resource acquisition, for which the DMPTool provides guidance.

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the desired early IT resource requirement identification process as requested by the IT manager, highlighting the crucial steps and interactions with the DMPTool system's components.

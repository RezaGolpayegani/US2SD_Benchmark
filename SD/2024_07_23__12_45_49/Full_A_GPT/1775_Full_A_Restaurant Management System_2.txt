Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a cashier, I want to display tabs of a table, so that I can continue with the liability" in PlantUML format requires outlining how the different system components interact with each other to fulfill this task. Below is a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML syntax that describes the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant CashierInterface
participant AuthenticationModule
participant OrderManagementSystem
participant Database

== Displaying Table Tabs for Payment ==

CashierInterface -> AuthenticationModule: Validate Cashier
AuthenticationModule -> CashierInterface: Validation Success

CashierInterface -> OrderManagementSystem: Request to Retrieve Table Tabs
OrderManagementSystem -> Database: Query Table and Orders
Database -> OrderManagementSystem: Return Table Order Data

OrderManagementSystem -> CashierInterface: Display Table Tabs

CashierInterface -> Cashier: Cashier Reviews Tabs

== Process for Continuing with Payment ==

Cashier -> CashierInterface: Confirm Payment Initiation
CashierInterface -> OrderManagementSystem: Process Payment Request
OrderManagementSystem -> Database: Update Order Status
Database -> OrderManagementSystem: Confirm Update

OrderManagementSystem -> PaymentGateway: Request Payment Processing
PaymentGateway -> OrderManagementSystem: Payment Success
OrderManagementSystem -> CashierInterface: Confirm Payment Success
CashierInterface -> Cashier: Display Payment Success Message

This sequence diagram starts with the cashier interfacing with the system to display tabs for a specific table. It breaks down the process into validation of the cashier's credentials, retrieval of the table and associated order data from the database, displaying the tabs to the cashier, and then proceeding with the payment process, which includes updating the order status in the database and interfacing with a payment gateway to process the transaction.

Please note, to render this diagram, you would need a PlantUML environment or any compatible tool that supports PlantUML syntax.

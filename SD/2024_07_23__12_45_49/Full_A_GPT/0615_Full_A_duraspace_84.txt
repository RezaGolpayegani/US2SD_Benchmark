Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves depicting the interactions between the DAMS manager, the DIMS system, and potentially external copyright information services or databases. Note that specific implementations may vary, and this configuration is a generalized representation. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DAMS Manager" as DAMSManager
participant "DIMS System" as DIMSSystem
database "Copyright Database" as CopyrightDB

DAMSManager -> DIMSSystem : Request copyright expiration info for object/component
DIMSSystem -> DIMSSystem : Validate request & identify object/component
DIMSSystem -> CopyrightDB : Query copyright statute & expiration
CopyrightDB -> DIMSSystem : Return statute info & expiration date
DIMSSystem -> DAMSManager : Display copyright expiration details

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram steps:
- **Step 1**: The DAMS manager initiates the process by requesting copyright expiration information for a specific object or component.
- **Step 2**: The DIMS system validates the request to ensure the requestor has the appropriate access rights and then identifies the requested object or component.
- **Step 3**: DIMS queries an internal or external copyright database to find the copyright statute applicable to the object/component and calculates or retrieves the expiration date based on the jurisdiction.
- **Step 4**: The copyright database returns the information to DIMS.
- **Step 5**: DIMS then displays or communicates the copyright expiration details to the DAMS manager.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interaction flow and can be expanded or modified to include more details, such extensions to handle errors or alternative flows, depending on the requirements and implementation specifics of the DIMS project. Keep in mind that for a more detailed implementation, additional steps like user authentication, error handling, and more detailed object/component identification might be necessary.

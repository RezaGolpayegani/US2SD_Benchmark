Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story: "As a manager, I want to add a store order" involves outlining the various interactions between components in the Restaurant Management and Operations System for this specific function. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that visualizes these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as managementInterface
participant "Inventory Service" as inventoryService
participant "Database" as database
participant "Supplier Management" as supplierManagement

manager -> managementInterface : initiateAddStoreOrder()
activate managementInterface

managementInterface -> inventoryService : checkInventoryLevels()
activate inventoryService

inventoryService -> database : queryInventory()
activate database

database --> inventoryService : inventoryData
deactivate database

inventoryService -> supplierManagement : suggestReorderQuantities(inventoryData)
deactivate inventoryService

supplierManagement -> managementInterface : displaySuggestedOrders()
activate supplierManagement

managementInterface -> manager : showSuggestedReorders()
deactivate suppliermore

manager -> managementInterface : confirmOrderDetails(orderDetails)
activate managementInterface

managementInterface -> inventoryService : updatePendingOrders(orderDetails)
activate inventoryService

inventoryService -> database : saveOrder(orderDetails)
activate database

database --> inventoryService : confirmationStatus
deactivate database

inventoryService --> managementInterface : orderUpdateStatus(confirmationStatus)
deactivate inventoryService

managementInterface --> manager : displayOrderConfirmation(confirmationStatus)

### Explanation:

1. **Manager Initiation**: The process starts with the manager initiating the action to add a store order through the Management Interface.

2. **Checking Inventory**: The Management Interface requests current inventory levels from the Inventory Service, which in turn queries the Database for up-to-date inventory data.

3. **Suggesting Reorders**: Based on the inventory levels, the Inventory Service contacts Supplier Management to suggest reorder quantities for low-stock items.

4. **Order Recommendations**: Supplier Management compiles suggestions and sends them back to the Management Interface, which then presents these suggested reorders to the manager.

5. **Order Confirmation**: After reviewing, the manager confirms the order details back to the Management Interface, which then informs the Inventory Service to update pending orders.

6. **Database Update**: The Inventory Service processes this request and updates the Database with the new order details.

7. **Confirmation to Manager**: Finally, the confirmation status is sent back through the chain to the Management Interface, and then to the manager, displaying the order confirmation.

This sequence diagram outlines a streamlined process for managing store orders through the Restaurant Management and Operations System, emphasizing interactions between different components to facilitate efficient and accurate order management.

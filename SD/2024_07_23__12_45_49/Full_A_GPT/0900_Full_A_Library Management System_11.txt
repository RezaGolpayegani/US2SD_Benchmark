Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to see my borrows" using PlantUML requires depicting the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) when a customer looks up their borrowed books. Below is a hypothetical sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax for this user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Customer as C
participant "Web Interface" as WI
participant "Server" as S
database "Database" as DB

C -> WI: Accesses borrows page
activate WI
WI -> S: Request to view borrowed books
activate S
S -> DB: Query borrowed books for customer
activate DB
DB --> S: Return borrow details
deactivate DB
S --> WI: Borrow details data
deactivate S
WI --> C: Display borrowed books
deactivate WI

```

Explanation:

1. **Customer (C) interacts with the Web Interface (WI):** The customer accesses the borrows page on the library management system's web interface, indicating the initiation of the process to see their borrowed books.

2. **Web Interface (WI) communicates with Server (S):** The web interface, upon receiving the customer's request, forwards this request to the server. This is where the web interface's role is to act as a bridge between the customer and the server, ensuring the customer's request is correctly formatted and sent to the server.

3. **Server (S) queries Database (DB):** The server, now holding the request details, queries the database to fetch the specifics of the books borrowed by the customer. At this stage, the server acts as an intermediary, transforming the request into database queries.

4. **Database (DB) returns data to Server (S):** The database processes the server's query, retrieves the details of the borrowed books associated with the customer's account, and sends this information back to the server. The database's role is critical as it holds all information regarding users, their borrows, and books.

5. **Server (S) sends data back to Web Interface (WI):** Once the server has the borrow details from the database, it packages this information and sends it back to the web interface, which will then handle the final step of the process.

6. **Web Interface (WI) displays information to Customer (C):** Upon receiving the borrowed books' details from the server, the web interface processes this information and displays it to the customer, completing the process.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction but captures the essence of the system components working together to serve the customer's request to view their borrowed books within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

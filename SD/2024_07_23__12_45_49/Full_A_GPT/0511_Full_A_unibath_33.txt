To illustrate how an external coordinator can access data from Bath collaborators off campus using the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, we'll create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram will outline the interactions between the external coordinator, the platform's interface, and backend systems to achieve effective collaboration.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ExternalCoordinator as EC
participant "Web Interface" as WI
participant "Authentication System" as AS
participant "Data Management\nSystem" as DMS
participant "Access Control\nModule" as ACM
database "Bath Data Archive" as BDA

EC -> WI: Request access to specific dataset
WI -> AS: Authenticate ExternalCoordinator
AS --> WI: Authentication Success
WI -> DMS: Request for dataset access(ExternalCoordinator)
DMS -> ACM: Verify access rights for ExternalCoordinator
ACM --> DMS: Access Granted
DSC -> BDA: Fetch dataset details
BDA --> DSC: Return dataset details
DMS --> WI: Provide dataset details and access link
WI --> EC: Display dataset details and download link
EC -> WI: Download dataset
WI -> DMS: Initiate download request
DMS -> BDA: Fetch dataset and metadata
BDA --> DMS: Return dataset and metadata
DMS --> WI: Provide dataset and metadata
WI --> EC: Download dataset and metadata

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **ExternalCoordinator (EC) Request**: The external coordinator starts by requesting access to a specific dataset through the Web Interface (WI).

2. **Authentication**: The WI interacts with the Authentication System (AS) to authenticate the external coordinator. Upon successful authentication, the process moves forward.

3. **Access Request**: The authenticated request for dataset access is passed from the WI to the Data Management System (DMS).

4. **Verify Access Rights**: The DMS consults the Access Control Module (ACM) to verify the external coordinator's access rights to the requested dataset.

5. **Access Granted**: If access is granted, the DMS interacts with the Bath Data Archive (BDA) to fetch the details of the requested dataset.

6. **Display Data and Download Link**: The web interface presents the dataset details and a download link to the external coordinator.

7. **Dataset Download**: Upon the external coordinator's request to download the dataset, the WI instructs the DMS to initiate the download.

8. **Fetch and Return Dataset**: The DMS retrieves the dataset and any associated metadata from the BDA and passes it back through the WI to the external coordinator for download.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of actions from the perspective of an external coordinator wanting to access and download datasets from the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform while off-campus. It captures the interactions with the systemâ€™s interface, authentication, access control, and data retrieval mechanisms.

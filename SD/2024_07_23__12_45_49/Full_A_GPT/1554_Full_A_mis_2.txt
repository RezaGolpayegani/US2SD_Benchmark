To fulfill your request, I'll outline a relatively simplified sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format. This diagram will demonstrate how a collection curator interacts with the EDRMS to view the scheduled record deletion date on an item and its component pages.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Curator as curator
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Authorization Module" as Auth
participant "Item Retrieval Module" as Retrieval
participant "Database" as DB

curator -> UI : Access item/component page
UI -> Auth : Validate access
Auth -> UI : Access granted
UI -> Retrievel : Request item/component details
Retrieval -> DB : Query for item/component details and deletion date
DB -> Retrieval : Return requested data
Retrieval -> UI : Display item/component details and deletion date
UI -> curator : Show item/component page with deletion date
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:
1. **Curator Access**: The collection curator initiates the process by attempting to access the item or component page through the UI Dashboard.
2. **Validation**: The UI Dashboard requests access validation from the Authorization Module (Auth) to ensure the curator has the necessary permissions to view the item/component details.
3. **Authorization Granted**: The Authorization Module confirms the curator's access rights and notifies the UI Dashboard.
4. **Details Request**: The UI Dashboard then requests the item or component details, including the scheduled deletion date, from the Item Retrieval Module.
5. **Database Query**: The Item Retrieval Module makes a query to the Database to fetch the details of the item or component along with its scheduled deletion date.
6. **Data Retrieval**: The Database returns the requested data, including the deletion date, to the Item Retrieval Module.
7. **Display Information**: The Item Retrieval Module sends the retrieved data back to the UI Dashboard, which in turn displays the item or component details and the scheduled deletion date to the curator.
8. **Outcome**: The curator views the item or component page, which now includes the scheduled deletion date.

This simplified sequence aims to capture the key interactions within the EDRMS pertaining to the user story. Adjustments and refinements may be necessary based on the specific implementation details and the broader system architecture of the EDRMS project.

Given the scope of your request, I'll provide a PlantUML sequence diagram that focuses on the process a site admin might follow to delete a course or event on the Scrum Alliance Community Platform. This will cover the interaction between the admin, the platform's interface, and the backend systems responsible for managing courses and events.

Please note, the following UML diagram is textual representation due to the limitations of this format. To visualize it, you'll need to use a PlantUML editor or another UML tool that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin as A
participant "Admin Interface" as AI
participant "Course/Event Management System" as CEMS
participant "Database" as DB

A -> AI : Selects course/event to delete
AI -> CEMS : Request deletion of selected course/event
activate CEMS
CEMS -> DB : Verify course/event exists
activate DB
DB --> CEMS : Confirmation of existence
deactivate DB
CEMS -> DB : Delete course/event from database
activate DB
DB --> CEMS : Confirm deletion
deactivate DB
CEMS --> AI : Confirm successful deletion
deactivate CEMS
AI --> A : Display deletion success message

```

The sequence diagram describes the following process:
1. The admin selects the course or event they wish to delete from the Admin Interface.
2. The Admin Interface requests the deletion of the selected course or event from the Course/Event Management System (CEMS).
3. The CEMS verifies with the Database if the course/event exists.
4. The Database confirms the existence of the course/event.
5. The CEMS then requests to delete the course/event from the database.
6. The Database confirms the deletion and returns this confirmation to the CEMS.
7. The CEMS confirms the successful deletion to the Admin Interface.
8. Finally, the Admin Interface displays a success message to the admin, confirming that the course or event has been successfully deleted.

This diagram is a simplified overview and might need adjustments based on the actual technical architecture and specific requirements of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform project.

Given the complexity of creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram directly through text, let's outline a simplified version that focuses on the key interactions between actors and systems for the user story:

**User Story: As an NSF employee, I want to have editorial-planning recommendations, so that I can understand how they might impact an eventual CMS / future web presence.**

To represent this in a sequence diagram format in PlantUML, we will consider the following actors and systems:

- **NSF Employee (User)**
- **Project Manager**
- **User Research Team**
- **Content Management System (CMS) Team**
- **Web Development Team**

The process involves the NSF Employee expressing interest in editorial-planning recommendations, which then triggers a series of actions involving user research, analysis, and collaboration with the web development team to provide insightful recommendations.

Below is a basic PlantUML script illustrating this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor NSF_Employee as "NSF Employee"
participant Project_Manager as "Project Manager"
participant User_Research_Team as "User Research Team"
participant CMS_Team as "CMS Team"
participant Web_Development_Team as "Web Development Team"

NSF_Employee -> Project_Manager : Request editorial-planning recommendations
Project_Manager -> User_Research_Team : Commission user research for CMS/editorial planning insights
activate User_Research_Team
User_Research_Team -> CMS_Team : Consult on CMS capabilities and best practices
activate CMS_Team
CMS_Team -> User_Research_Team : Provide CMS insights and constraints
deactivate CMS_Team
User_Research_Team -> Web_Development_Team : Relay CMS insights and user needs
activate Web_Development_Team
Web_Development_Team -> User_Research_Team : Propose editorial-planning recommendations based on technical feasibility
deactivate Web_Development_Team
User_Research_Team -> Project_Manager : Deliver compiled recommendations
deactivate User_Research_Team
Project_Manager -> NSF_Employee : Present editorial-planning recommendations

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified flow and should be adapted or expanded based on specific project needs, interactions, and steps. For instance, additional steps might include feedback loops where the NSF Employee reviews and provides feedback on the recommendations, or iterations where the CMS Team adjusts their recommendations based on new insights or technological capabilities.

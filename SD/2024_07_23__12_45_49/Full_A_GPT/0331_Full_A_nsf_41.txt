Given your request, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the flow of identifying the initial hypotheses which a developer needs in order to plan prototype development work. This scenario assumes a collaboration among team members, including User Researchers, the Project Manager, and the Developer themselves.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Project Manager" as PM
participant "User Research Team" as URT
participant "Github" as GH
database "CMS" as CMS

== Hypothesis Identification ==
Developer -> PM : Request for initial hypotheses
PM -> URT : Consolidate findings for initial hypotheses
URT -> PM : Provides 3 initial hypotheses based on user research
PM -> Developer : Communicates the 3 hypotheses

== Prototype Planning ==
Developer -> GH : Query for existing insights on hypotheses
GH -> Developer : Returns related discussions and documents
Developer -> PM : Discusses feasibility and resources
PM -> Developer : Confirms prototype development for the hypotheses

== Prototype Development ==
Developer -> Developer: Determine technology stack based on hypotheses
Developer -> CMS : Assess CMS capabilities for prototype
Developer -> GH : Create new branch for prototype development
Developer -> Developer: Develops prototypes based on each hypothesis
Developer -> GH : Commits prototypes for team review

== Review and Feedback ==
Developer -> PM : Notify on prototype completion
PM -> URT : Organize prototype review session
URT -> GH : Provides feedback via Github issues
GH -> Developer : Notify about feedback
Developer -> Developer : Refines prototypes based on feedback

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between a developer, project manager, user research team, Github for code and issue management, and the Content Management System (CMS) that may be used to assess capabilities and manage content for prototypes. The processes include identifying initial hypotheses, planning and developing prototypes based on those hypotheses, and refining the prototypes after feedback from the user research team. It illustrates a collaborative and iterative approach to development in line with agile methodologies.

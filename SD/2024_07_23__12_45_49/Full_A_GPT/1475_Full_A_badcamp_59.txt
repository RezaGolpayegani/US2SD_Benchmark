To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As an anonymous user, I want to receive a notification when sessions have been evaluated, so that I know whether I've been accepted or rejected" in PlantUML format, it's important to clarify that generally, anonymous users do not receive personalized notifications due to the lack of identifiable information. However, in the spirit of fulfilling the task based on the provided context, we can adapt the scenario to anonymized public announcements where session acceptance/rejection is posted, or generalize the solution assuming the platform allows for some form of temporary identification (like a submission ID).

Let's diagram a generic process where an anonymous user submits a session for approval and then receives a notification (e.g., via a public feed or an anonymized check-in mechanism):

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AnonymousUser as user
entity "Session Submission System" as submissionSystem
entity "Session Review Board" as reviewBoard
entity "Notification System" as notificationSystem
database "Session Database" as sessionDB

user -> submissionSystem : Submits session
submissionSystem -> sessionDB : Saves submission
submissionDB -> reviewBoard : Submits for review
reviewBoard -> sessionDB : Updates session status\nto "Accepted" or "Rejected"
sessionDB -> notificationSystem : Triggers status update notification
notificationFinishRef: Public/anonymized notification point
note right of notificationFinishRef
  Anonymous users check the status
  of their submission through a public
  feed or an anonymized system
end note

notificationSystem ..> notificationFinishRef : Notification is made public

```

This diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Submission:** The anonymous user submits a session for approval through the session submission system.
2. **Saving:** The submission system saves the session submission details in the Session Database.
3. **Review:** The Session Review Board reviews the session by accessing submissions from the Session Database.
4. **Update:** Upon evaluation, the session's status (Accepted or Rejected) is updated in the database by the Review Board.
5. **Notification Trigger:** The change in session status triggers the Notification System to make a public announcement or update an anonymized notification system.
6. **Notification:** The anonymous user checks the public feed or an anonymized system to learn about the status of their session submission, which completes the process.

This adapted approach considers the anonymity of the user while still providing a means for notification regarding their session submission status.

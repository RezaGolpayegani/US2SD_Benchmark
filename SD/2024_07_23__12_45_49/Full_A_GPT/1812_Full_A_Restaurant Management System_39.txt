Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a cook, I want to be able to edit store orders" involves specifying how system components interact to fulfill this requirement. Since the task is to generate a diagram in PlantUML syntax, the following is an example that represents the possible interactions between a Cook and the Restaurant Management and Operations System when editing an order:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook
participant "Cook Interface" as CI
participant "Order Management Module" as OMM
participant "Database" as DB

Cook -> CI : Selects order to edit
CI -> OMM : Request order details
OMM -> DB : Fetch order details
DB --> OMM : Order details
OMM --> CI : Display order details
Cook -> CI : Inputs changes (e.g., modify items, quantities)
CI -> OMM : Send changes
OMM -> DB : Update order details
DB --> OMM : Confirmation of update
OMM --> CI : Display update confirmation
CI --> Cook : Show confirmation message

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Cook selecting an order to edit via the Cook Interface. Then, the sequence flows through requesting and displaying the order details, to the Cook making changes. These changes are sent back through the system to update the database, with confirmations displayed back to the cook.

Remember, this is a simplified example. Real-world scenarios might involve more security checks, error handling, interaction with other modules (like inventory management for stock checks), or notifications to other staff (e.g., servers or the front desk) about order changes.

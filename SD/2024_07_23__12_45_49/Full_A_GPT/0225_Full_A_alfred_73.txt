To fulfill your request creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML code for the user story provided, it's necessary first to outline the actors and steps involved in the process. For the user story: "As an Older Person, I want to use ALFRED to learn about all the social activities that are organized in my neighborhood", the sequence might follow these steps:

1. The Older Person (User) initiates the query through a voice command to ALFRED.
2. ALFRED processes the voice command and identifies it as a request for social activities.
3. ALFRED accesses the Social Activities Service/API to fetch the latest information on neighborhood social activities.
4. The Social Activities Service/API retrieves the requested information from its database.
5. The information on social activities is returned to ALFRED from the service.
6. ALFRED processes and formats the information for voice output.
7. ALFRED provides the Older Person with a spoken summary of all upcoming neighborhood social activities.

Given this outline, here's how to represent this process in PlantUML code as a sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED" as alfred
participant "Social Activities Service/API" as api
database "Activities Database" as db

user -> alfred: "Tell me about neighborhood social activities"
alfred -> api: Request social activities
api -> db: Fetch activities information
db --> api: Return activities data
api --> alfred: Social activities information
alfred --> user: Spoken summary of social activities

@enduml
```

This PlantUML code creates a sequence diagram showing each step from the Older Person requesting information to ALFRED providing the spoken summary. You can further elaborate on this basic template to include more detailed interactions, error handling, or additional functionalities (like preferences filtering or reminders for interesting activities) depending on the detail level you wish to achieve.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a Publisher, I want to have private data packages, so that I can share just with my team" involves outlining the interactions between the Publisher, the Data Registry and Publishing Platform (hereafter referred to as "the Platform"), and potential internal components of the Platform such as the User Account Management, Dataset Publishing service, and perhaps even an Access Control component. Below is a basic Plant UML format sequence diagram representing these interactions.

Please note that for brevity and simplicity, this diagram focuses on key steps and abstracts some details. The implementation can vary significantly based on the actual architecture and requirements of the Platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "User Account Management" as UAM
participant "Dataset Publishing" as DP
database "Access Control" as AC

Publisher -> UAM : log in via GitHub or Google
activate UAM
UAM --> Publisher : authentication successful
deactivate UAM

Publisher -> DP : initiate data package creation
activate DP
DP -> DP : prepare package metadata
DP -> AC : set package visibility to private
activate AC
AC --> DP : visibility set
deactivate AC

DP -> DP : import dataset
DP -> DP : validate dataset
DP -> DP : save dataset package

Publisher -> DP : publish package to team
DP -> AC : verify team access rights
activate AC
AC --> DP : access verified
deactivate AC

DP -> DP : notify team members
DP --> Publisher : package published successfully
deactivate DP

```

This diagram assumes a simplified process where:
1. A Publisher logs in through an integrated external login system (GitHub or Google).
2. The Publisher initiates the creation of a data package.
3. The dataset publishing service prepares the metadata, sets the visibility to private within an access control database, imports, and validates the dataset.
4. Once validated, the Publisher proceeds to publish the package, at which point the system verifies the team's access rights.
5. After successful verification, the dataset is made available to the team, and team members are notified.

Each step in this process might involve more detailed interactions not represented in this simplified view. The specifics of implementation would also depend heavily on how the access rights are managed, the database technologies used, and how notifications are handled.

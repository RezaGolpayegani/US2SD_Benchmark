Certainly! Below is an example of how to create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "**As a member, I want to look up books and place reservations**" using PlantUML.

This example focuses on the interactions involved in searching for books and placing a reservation by a library member:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Search Interface" as Search
database "Library Database" as DB
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation

Member -> Search: Enter search criteria\n(title, author, or category)
activate Search
Search -> DB: Query books by criteria
activate DB
DB --> Search: Return search results
deactivate DB

Search --> Member: Display search results
deactivate Search

Member -> Search: Select book from results
activate Search
Search -> DB: Check availability of selected book
activate DB
DB --> Search: Book availability status
deactivate DB

Search --> Member: Show availability status
deactivate Search

Member -> Reservation: Request to reserve book
activate Reservation
Reservation -> DB: Create reservation record
activate DB
DB --> Reservation: Confirmation of reservation
deactivate DB

Reservation --> Member: Reservation confirmed
deactivate Reservation
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process flow as follows:

1. The **Member** initiates the process by entering search criteria such as title, author, or category into the **Search Interface**.
2. The **Search Interface** queries the **Library Database** for books matching the criteria.
3. The **Library Database** returns the search results to the **Search Interface**.
4. The **Search Interface** displays the search results to the **Member**.
5. The **Member** selects a book from the results and requests its availability status.
6. The **Search Interface** queries the **Library Database** again to check the selected book's availability.
7. The **Library Database** returns the book availability status to the **Search Interface**, which then informs the **Member**.
8. If the book is available, the **Member** requests to reserve the book using the **Reservation System**.
9. The **Reservation System** creates a reservation record in the **Library Database**.
10. The **Library Database** sends a confirmation of the reservation to the **Reservation System**, which then confirms the reservation to the **Member**.

This sequence demonstrates how a member can look up books and place reservations within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

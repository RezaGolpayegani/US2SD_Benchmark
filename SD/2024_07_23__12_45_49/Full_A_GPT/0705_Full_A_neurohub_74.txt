Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a researcher, I want to have remote access to my data for off-site working, so that I can still work effectively while away from the lab" involves illustrating how various components of the Neurohub platform interact to fulfill this requirement. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram representation of the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as R
participant "Remote Access\nPortal" as RAP
participant Authentication as Auth
participant "Neurohub\nPlatform" as NP
participant "Data Storage" as DS

R -> RAP: Request remote access
RAP -> Auth: Authenticate user
Auth -> RAP: Authentication Successful

activate RAP
RAP -> NP: Request access to data
activate NP
NP -> DS: Fetch requested data
activate DS
DS -> NP: Return requested data
deactivate DS
NP -> RAP: Return data to portal
deactivate NP
RAP -> R: Display data
deactivate RAP

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Researcher (R) requests remote access**: This is the initial action where the researcher tries to access their data remotely through the Neurohub Remote Access Portal.

2. **Remote Access Portal (RAP) handles authentication**: The Remote Access Portal forwards the authentication request to the Authentication module to verify the identity of the researcher.

3. **Authentication (Auth) successful**: The Authentication module confirms the researcher's credentials and notifies the Remote Access Portal of the successful authentication.

4. **Remote Access Portal (RAP) requests access to data**: After successful authentication, the Remote Access Portal requests access to the specific data the researcher wants to work with from the Neurohub Platform.

5. **Neurohub Platform (NP) fetches requested data**: The Neurohub Platform processes this request and fetches the data from the Data Storage system.

6. **Data Storage (DS) returns requested data**: The Data Storage system retrieves and sends the requested data back to the Neurohub Platform.

7. **Neurohub Platform (NP) returns data to portal**: The Neurohub Platform packages the data and sends it back to the Remote Access Portal.

8. **Remote Access Portal (RAP) displays data to the researcher**: Finally, the Remote Access Portal presents the data to the researcher, allowing them to work remotely.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow for a researcher accessing their data remotely for off-site work, emphasizing the interactions between the researcher, the remote access infrastructure, the Neurohub platform, and the back-end data storage components.

Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As an Admin, I want to invite someone to join the platform, so that they can start contributing or using data" entails detailing the interactions between the system components in a step-by-step format. Below is a PlantUML code snippet to represent these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Admin
participant "Admin Interface" as AdminUI
participant "Invitation Service" as InvitationService
participant "Email Service" as EmailService
database "User Database" as UserDB

== Invitation Process ==
Admin -> AdminUI : Access invitation feature
AdminUI -> InvitationService : Input user email for invitation
InvitationService -> UserDB : Check if email already exists
alt Email exists
    InvitationService -> AdminUI : Show error message
    AdminUI -> Admin : Display "User already exists"
else Email does not exist
    InvitationService -> EmailService : Send invitation email
    EmailService -> UserDB : Create user with status "Invited"
    EmailService -> AdminUI : Confirmation of invitation sent
    AdminUI -> Admin : Display "Invitation sent successfully"
end

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Admin Initiates Invitation**: The process begins with the Admin accessing the invitation feature through the Admin Interface.

2. **Input User Email for Invitation**: The Admin inputs the prospective user's email into the Admin Interface, which is then sent to the Invitation Service.

3. **Check for Existing Email**: The Invitation Service checks the User Database to see if the email address already exists in the system.

4. **Email Exists Scenario**:
    - If the email already exists, the Invitation Service sends an error message back to the Admin Interface.
    - The Admin Interface then notifies the Admin that the user already exists.

5. **Email Does Not Exist Scenario**:
    - If the email does not exist in the system, the Invitation Service proceeds to send an invitation email via the Email Service.
    - The Email Service creates a new user record with the status "Invited" in the User Database.
    - Once the invitation email is sent, the Email Service confirms the action to the Admin Interface.
    - Finally, the Admin Interface displays a success message to the Admin, indicating that the invitation was sent successfully.

This sequence diagram illustrates the detailed interactions between different components of the system to accomplish the task of inviting a new user to the platform as per the admin's request.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the provided user story involves laying out the sequence of interactions between the library staff, the library management system, and any other components involved in locating a book on the shelf. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that corresponds to the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff as "Library Staff"
participant UI as "CLMS Interface"
participant System as "Management System"
participant Database as "Database"

== See Shelf Location of a Book ==

Staff -> UI : Enter search criteria\n(for book details)
UI -> System : Request book information
System -> Database : Query book details\n(including shelf location)
Database --> System : Return book details\nand shelf location
System --> UI : Display book details\n(including shelf route)
UI --> Staff : Show book shelf location

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the library staff entering the search criteria for a book into the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) Interface. The system then processes this request, querying the database for the book details, including its shelf location. Once the database returns the information, the system displays it back on the interface for the staff, who can then quickly locate and retrieve the book for the member.

To use this sequence diagram, you need to have PlantUML set up on your system or use an online editor that supports PlantUML syntax. The diagram provides a simplified view of the process of locating a book on the shelf based on the user story provided.

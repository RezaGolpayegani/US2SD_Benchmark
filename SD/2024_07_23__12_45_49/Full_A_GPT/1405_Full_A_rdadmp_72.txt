Given the user story you've shared, the sequence diagram below is designed to depict the interactions between an institutional data manager and the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) regarding privacy and security requirements for planning the right storage system and sharing permissions. 

Note that due to the limitations in formatting here, I'll describe how to set up the PlantUML code to generate the sequence diagram. To visualize the diagram, you'd need to use a PlantUML compiler or an online tool that can render PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager as "Institutional Data Manager"
participant DMPToolInterface as "DMPTool Interface"
participant SecurityModule as "Security & Privacy Module"
participant MetadataDatabase as "Metadata Database"
participant ComplianceChecker as "Compliance Checker"
participant StoragePlanner as "Storage Planner"

DataManager -> DMPToolInterface : Access DMPTool
DMPToolInterface -> SecurityModule : Request security requirements for data
SecurityModule -> MetadataDatabase : Retrieve data types and sensitivity
MetadataDatabase --> SecurityModule : Data types and sensitivity levels
SecurityModule -> ComplianceChecker : Check compliance with legal standards
ComplianceChecker --> SecurityModule : Compliance status and requirements
SecurityModule --> DMPToolInterface : Display security and privacy requirements
DMPToolInterface -> DataManager : Show security and privacy requirements
DataManager -> DMPToolInterface : Request storage and permission planning tools
DMPToolInterface -> StoragePlanner : Initiate storage system planning
StoragePlanner -> SecurityModule : Refer to security requirements
SecurityModule --> StoragePlanner : Provide required security levels
StoragePlanner --> DMPToolInterface : Present storage and permission options
DMPToolInterface --> DataManager : Options for storage systems and sharing permissions
DataManager -> DMPToolInterface : Select preferred storage and permissions setup
DMPToolInterface -> MetadataDatabase : Update project with selected storage and permissions
MetadataDatabase --> DMPToolInterface : Confirm update
DMPToolInterface --> DataManager : Confirm storage and permissions setup

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram
- The **Institutional Data Manager** initiates the process by accessing the DMPTool to understand the privacy and security requirements for their data.
- The **DMPTool Interface** acts as the primary interface for interaction.
- The **Security & Privacy Module** handles queries related to data security and privacy requirements, interacting with the **Metadata Database** to understand the type and sensitivity of the data involved.
- The **Compliance Checker** then ensures that the security requirements align with legal and ethical standards.
- Based on the security and privacy requirements, the **Storage Planner** offers options for storage systems and sharing permissions that adhere to these requirements.
- Finally, the Institutional Data Manager makes selections regarding the storage and permissions, which are updated in the **Metadata Database**, ensuring that the data management plan aligns with the necessary privacy and security standards.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a librarian, I want to remove books from the library" using PlantUML requires defining the actors, systems, and interactions involved in removing books from the library through the **Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).** This includes actions like selecting the book(s) to be removed and confirming the deletion.

**PlantUML Code:**

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as system
database "Library Database" as db

== Remove Books from Library ==

librarian -> system : Access book management
activate system

system -> db : Retrieve books list
activate db
db --> system : Books list
deactivate db

librarian -> system : Select books to remove
activate system

librarian -> system : Confirm removal
activate system

system -> db : Delete book records
activate db
db --> system : Confirm deletion
deactivate db

system --> librarian : Show success message
deactivate system

@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Code:**

1. **Interaction Start**: The interaction begins with the librarian who wants to remove one or more books from the library.

2. **Access Book Management**: The librarian accesses the book management feature of the CLMS.

3. **Retrieve Books List**: The system retrieves and displays a list of books from the library database for the librarian to review.

4. **Select Books to Remove**: The librarian selects the specific books that they intend to remove from the library's collection.

5. **Confirm Removal**: The librarian confirms the removal of the selected books. This is an important step to avoid accidental deletions.

6. **Delete Book Records**: The system sends a request to the library database to delete the records of the selected books.

7. **Confirmation**: The library database confirms the deletion of the book records and notifies the system.

8. **Success Message**: The system then displays a success message to the librarian, indicating that the selected books have been successfully removed from the library.

9. **Interaction End**: This marks the end of the 'Remove Books from Library' process.

This sequence diagram outlines the typical flow of actions when a librarian uses CLMS to remove books. It emphasizes interactions with both the system's interface and the underlying library database, ensuring the operation is performed accurately and securely.

Given your request, I will design a simplified sequence diagram for the described user story: "As a Staff, I want to search for a book by publication date, so that I can filter books by date" using PlantUML syntax. Please note, for a comprehensive implementation, the actual system might require more detailed interactions based on specific architectural designs and frameworks used.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Library Management System" as LMS
database "Books Database" as DB

== Search for Book by Publication Date ==

Staff -> SI: Enter publication date range
activate SI

SI -> LMS: Search request(date range)
activate LMS

LMS -> DB: Query books by date
activate DB

DB --> LMS: Return books
deactivate DB

LMS --> SI: Show search results
deactivate LMS

SI --> Staff: Display books
deactivate SI

@enduml
```

This diagram reflects the following steps:
1. The staff initiates the action by entering a publication date range into the Search Interface.
2. The Search Interface sends this search request to the Library Management System (LMS).
3. The LMS processes this request and queries the Books Database for books within the specified date range.
4. The Books Database returns the list of books that match the criteria.
5. The LMS then sends these search results back to the Search Interface.
6. Finally, the Search Interface displays the books to the staff.

This sequence diagram is a basic representation. Depending on the specifics of the CLMS, including any middleware, authentication and authorization protocols, and additional functionalities like logging or error handling, more details could be added to this diagram. Also, the implementation might involve advanced search options like indexing for faster searches, which isn't detailed here but should be considered during actual development.

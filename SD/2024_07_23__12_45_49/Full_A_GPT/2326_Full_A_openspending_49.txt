Below you'll find a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format that depicts the process of a Data Consuming User searching for datasets by their title and metadata on the OpenSpending platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant SearchInterface
participant Database
participant Dataset

User -> SearchInterface : Enter search query (title/metadata)
activate SearchInterface

SearchInterface -> Database : Search datasets by query
activate Database

Database -> Dataset : Retrieve matching datasets
activate Dataset

Dataset --> Database : List of matching datasets
deactivate Dataset

Database --> SearchInterface : Search results
deactivate Database

SearchInterface --> User : Display search results
deactivate SearchInterface

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved when a Data Consuming User looks for datasets on the OpenSpending platform using specific criteria (e.g., title, metadata). The process kicks off with the user entering their search query, which is then processed by the platform's search interface. The search interface queries the database for datasets matching the entered criteria. The database retrieves the details of the datasets that fit these criteria and forwards this information back to the search interface, which ultimately presents the search results to the user.

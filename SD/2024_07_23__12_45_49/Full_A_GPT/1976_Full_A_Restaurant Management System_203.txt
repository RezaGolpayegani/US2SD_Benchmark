Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story — "As a manager, I want to see the total profit and total loss at the end of the day" — involves several components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System interacting together. Given the complexity and the high level of abstraction in the project description, the following PlantUML code provides a simplified sequence diagram focusing on the key interactions.

Please note that this diagram assumes a basic interaction flow where the manager requests a report, the system calculates the total profit and loss by aggregating sales and expenses, and then presents this information. Adjustments may be necessary to align with the specific implementations and integrations of your system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management\nInterface" as UI
participant "Backend\nServer" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> UI : Request profit and loss report
UI -> Backend : Get report data
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Retrieve sales data
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Sales data
deactivate DB

Backend -> DB : Retrieve expense data
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Expense data
deactivate DB

Backend -> Backend : Calculate total profit and loss
Backend --> UI : Report data
deactivate Backend

UI --> Manager : Display profit and loss report
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram includes the following steps:
1. The manager requests a profit and loss report from the Management Interface (UI).
2. The Management Interface sends a request to the Backend Server to get the necessary report data.
3. The Backend Server requests sales data and then expense data from the Database.
4. The Database returns the requested sales data and expense data to the Backend Server.
5. The Backend Server calculates the total profit and loss based on the retrieved data.
6. The Backend Server sends the report data back to the Management Interface.
7. The Management Interface displays the profit and loss report to the manager.

This diagram is simplified to highlight the main interactions and flow of data for the user story. Depending on the actual complexity of your Restaurant Management and Operations System, you might need to include additional details, such as authentication steps, more granular data retrieval and processing, or interaction with other components or external services.

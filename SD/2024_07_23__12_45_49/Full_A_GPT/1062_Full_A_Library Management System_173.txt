Given your project description and user story on a library member wanting to search for a book by its name to check availability, the sequence diagram in PlantUML format might look something like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember as member
participant "Search Interface" as search
participant "Book Controller" as controller
database "Book Database" as db
participant "Results Page" as results

== Book Search Sequence ==

member -> search : Enter book name
search -> controller : Request book search("book name")
activate controller

controller -> db : Query book by name("book name")
activate db
db -> db : Fetch matching books
deactivate db

db -> controller : Return search results
controller -> results : Display available books
results -> member : Show search results and availability

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram showcases the following steps:

1. **Library Member Initiates Search**: The library member starts the process by entering the book name into the search interface.
2. **Search Request Processed**: The search interface sends the book name to the Book Controller, which is responsible for handling the search logic.
3. **Database Query**: The Book Controller queries the Book Database for books matching the entered name.
4. **Fetching Results**: The Book Database fetches the list of matching books based on the search criteria.
5. **Results Returned**: The Book Database returns the search results to the Book Controller.
6. **Displaying Results**: The Book Controller then sends the results to the Results Page, which displays the available books to the library member.

This PlantUML diagram offers a simple sequential visualization of the search functionality from the user's perspective, focusing on the system's backend process of querying and displaying book availability based on name searches.

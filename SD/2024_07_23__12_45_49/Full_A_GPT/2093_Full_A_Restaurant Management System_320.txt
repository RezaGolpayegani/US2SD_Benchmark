To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to view order items under menu groups" using PlantUML, we need to map out the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. 

Here's an outline of the flow we'll diagram:

1. The waiter selects a menu group (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).
2. The system queries the database to retrieve the items under the selected menu group.
3. The database returns the list of items.
4. The system displays the items to the waiter.

Now, let's turn this flow into a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Restaurant Database" as Database

Waiter -> UI : Selects menu group
UI -> Backend : Request items under menu group
Backend -> Database : Query items of menu group
Database -> Backend : Return list of items
Backend -> UI : Display items to waiter
UI -> Waiter : Show menu items

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram script illustrates the process of a waiter viewing order items under specific menu groups. The script outlines the interactions between the waiter, the system's UI Interface, the Backend System, and the Restaurant Database. 

### How to Use This Script:
1. Copy the provided PlantUML script.
2. Use an online PlantUML editor, or install a PlantUML environment on your computer.
3. Paste the script into the PlantUML editor.
4. Generate the diagram according to the editor or environment's instructions.

This diagram will visually represent the sequence of actions triggered by the waiter wanting to view items within a menu group, showcasing the flow of data between the system's components to fulfill this request.

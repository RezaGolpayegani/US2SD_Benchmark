Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of "As an owner, I want to get the report of total sales of items on the menu so that I can offer a discount for the products which do not have the anticipated interest from the customer" involves several system components and interactions. Below is a PlantUML code that visualizes the steps involved from the perspective of the owner initiating a request to view the sales report and deciding on discount strategies based on the data.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Owner as owner
participant "Management Interface" as interface
participant "Report System" as reportSystem
participant "Database" as database
participant "Discount Management" as discount

== Generate Sales Report ==
owner -> interface: Request sales report
interface -> reportSystem: Generate report for menu item sales
reportSystem -> database: Query sales data
database --> reportSystem: Return sales data
reportSystem --> interface: Display sales report
interface --> owner: Show report

== Analyze Report and Apply Discounts ==
owner -> interface: Identify items for discount
interface -> discount: Set discount on identified items
discount -> database: Update menu item discounts
database --> discount: Confirm discount update
discount --> interface: Display updated discounts
interface --> owner: Confirm discount adjustments

This sequence diagram outlines the process where the restaurant owner interacts with the management interface to request and review a sales report. Following review, the owner decides which items need a discount based on their performance. The interface then communicates with the system's discount management module to apply these adjustments, which subsequently updates the database. Finally, confirmation of these changes is displayed back to the owner through the management interface.

Please note, the actual implementation details can vary based on specific project requirements and the chosen technology stack. This example assumes a somewhat simplified view of the interactions for clarity and educational purposes.

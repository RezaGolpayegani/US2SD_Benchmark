Given your request, below is an example of a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story "As a site visitor, I want to read current news on the Home page, so that I stay current on agile news." This scenario involves interactions between a site visitor, the website's front end, and the back end system responsible for managing news content.

Please note, to visualize this PlantUML code, you will need to use a PlantUML interpreter or a compatible tool that can render PlantUML code into a graphical sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Visitor as V
participant "Front-end System" as F
participant "Back-end System" as B

V -> F : Visit homepage
activate F
F -> B : Request current news
activate B

B -> B : Fetch latest news
B --> F : Return current news data
deactivate B

F --> V : Display current news
deactivate F

```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Visitor and Front-end System Interaction**:
    - The sequence diagram starts with the interaction between the site visitor (user) and the website's front-end system. The user (as "Visitor") accesses the home page to view the current news.

2. **Front-end to Back-end Request**:
    - Upon the visitor's action of visiting the home page, the front-end system makes a request to the back-end system to fetch the current news. This illustrates the process of the front-end system asking for the latest news content.

3. **Back-end System Processing**:
    - The back-end system then processes the request by fetching the latest news from its database or content management system. This step involves internal processing within the back-end system to retrieve the most current agile news content.

4. **Data Return and Display**:
    - Once the back-end system has fetched the latest news, it sends this data back to the front-end system. The sequence completes with the front-end system displaying the current news to the visitor. This final step ensures the user's goal of staying current on agile news is met by showing the latest articles or updates.

### Additional Information:

To use this PlantUML diagram, make sure to have PlantUML installed or access to an online PlantUML editor. You might need to adjust the diagram based on your specific development environment or if additional steps are required in your process (e.g., handling errors, filtering news content).

This sequence diagram aims to capture a simplified view of the process involved in a site visitor wanting to read the current news on the home page. Based on your project's complexity and the technologies used, you may need to adapt the diagram accordingly.

To visualize the process described in your user story about a manager wanting to track which employees sell the most number of products for rewarding purposes, we'll develop a simplified sequence diagram. This exercise assumes familiarity with basic UML notation and the sequence diagram syntax used by PlantUML. 

Please note, this diagram focuses on the interaction between components (like the Manager, System Interface, Database, and Employee Record) to achieve this functionality. For brevity and clarity, error handling and alternative paths aren't elaborated on in detail.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Manager as mgr
participant "System Interface" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
database "Database" as db
participant "Employee Record" as empRecord

mgr -> ui : Access sales tracking feature
ui -> server : Request employee sales data
server -> db : Query sales data by employee
db --> server : Return aggregated sales data
server -> empRecord : Identify top sales employees
empRecord --> server : Return employee ranking
server --> ui : Display sales ranking to manager
ui --> mgr : Show top selling employees and options

mgr -> ui : Select top performers
ui -> server : Send instruction to update salaries
server -> db : Update employee salary records
db --> server : Confirm salary updates
server --> ui : Confirm success to manager
ui --> mgr : Display success message

### Key Components in the Diagram:
- **Manager (mgr):** Represents the restaurant manager using the system.
- **System Interface (ui):** The front-end interface through which the manager interacts with the system.
- **Backend Server (server):** Handles business logic, such as processing requests from the UI and communicating with the database.
- **Database (db):** Stores all the relevant data, including employee sales figures and salary information.
- **Employee Record (empRecord):** A conceptual representation of the handling of employee data within the system. This could be part of the server or a separate service, depending on the system's architecture.

### How to Decode the Diagram:
- The manager initiates the process by accessing the sales tracking feature through the system interface (UI).
- The UI requests employee sales data from the backend server, which then queries the database for sales data organized by employee.
- The database returns the aggregated sales data to the server, which identifies the top sales employees and returns this ranking to the UI.
- The manager, upon viewing the top-selling employees, selects those who should receive a salary increase.
- The UI sends this instruction back to the server, which updates the relevant employee salary records in the database.
- Upon successful update, the server communicates this back to the UI, which then informs the manager of the successful operation.

This sequence diagram simplifies complex system interactions into a clear, step-by-step process that reflects the user story's requirements. Remember, actual implementation may introduce additional complexity, including error handling, authentication, and authorization steps.

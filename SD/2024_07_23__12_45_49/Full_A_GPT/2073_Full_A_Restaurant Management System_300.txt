Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a waiter, I want to see the availability of the order items" involves illustrating the interactions between various system components and actors to fulfill this requirement. The sequence will start from the waiter's request up to the system's response displaying the required information. Given the complexities and limitations of formatting here, a simplified textual representation of what this PlantUML code would look like is provided:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Inventory Management System" as IMS
participant "Menu Database" as MDB

== Check Item Availability ==

Waiter -> OMS: Requests item availability
activate OMS

OMS -> IMS: Query item stock levels
activate IMS

IMS -> MDB: Fetch current stock for items
activate MDB

MDB --> IMS: Stock levels
deactivate MDB

IMS --> OMS: Item availability data
deactivate IMS

OMS --> Waiter: Display item availability
deactivate OMS

@enduml
```

To explain this sequence:

1. **Start**: The waiter interacts with the system (probably through a digital interface), intending to see the availability of order items.

2. **Order Management System (OMS) Request**: The waiter's request is received by the Order Management System, which is responsible for aggregating and processing order-related inquiries.

3. **Query Item Stock Levels**: The OMS then forwards this request to the Inventory Management System (IMS), which is tasked with tracking stock levels of various items in the restaurant.

4. **Fetch Current Stock**: The IMS communicates with the Menu Database, which holds the detailed records of all menu items, including their stock levels.

5. **Stock Levels Response**: The Menu Database responds with the current stock levels for the requested items back to the IMS.

6. **Item Availability Data**: The IMS processes this information to determine the availability status (available, low stock, out of stock) and sends this data back to the OMS.

7. **Display Item Availability**: Finally, the OMS presents the item availability information to the waiter, completing the request.

This diagram maps the basic flow of information without detailing specific technical implementations (like HTTP requests or database queries) to keep the focus on the system's logical components and their interactions. For actual implementation, additional details like error handling, security considerations, and interface specifications would be necessary.

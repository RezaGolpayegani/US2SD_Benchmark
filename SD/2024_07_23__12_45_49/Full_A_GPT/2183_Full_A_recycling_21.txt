To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story, we need to define the steps involved in the process of an administrator blocking a specific user based on IP address to prevent spamming on the website. Here's a sequence diagram that outlines these steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "User Management\nSystem" as UserManager
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Security\nSystem" as Security

== Block User IP Address ==

Admin -> Dashboard : Access Dashboard
activate Dashboard

Dashboard -> UserManager : Request to block IP
activate UserManager

UserManager -> DB : Search User by IP
activate DB

DB --> UserManager : User Details
deactivate DB

UserManager -> Security : Block IP Address
activate Security

Security -> DB : Update IP Block List
activate DB

DB --> Security : Confirmation
deactivate DB

Security --> UserManager : IP Blocked Successfully
deactivate Security

UserManager --> Dashboard : Display Success Message
deactivate UserManager

Dashboard --> Admin : Show Confirmation Message
deegrate Dashboard

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the Administrator accessing the Admin Dashboard. The Admin chooses to block a user based on their IP address, which prompts the dashboard to communicate with the User Management System. This system interacts with the Database to fetch the user details associated with the given IP address. Once the user is identified, the User Management System instructs the Security System to block the IP address. The Security System updates the IP block list in the Database, and upon successful completion, a chain of confirmations is sent back to the Administrator, confirming that the IP address has been blocked to prevent spamming on the website.

Given the user story, we are going to outline a sequence diagram for the scenario where a Developer/Publisher creates an embeddable data summary that can be shared across sites via an iframe. This involves interactions between the user (Developer/Publisher), DPIE (DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer), and potentially other systems for retrieving and processing the data before embedding. Due to the project's broad nature, this sequence will be a high-level overview.

```
@startuml
actor DeveloperPublisher as DP
participant "DPIE Web Interface" as DPIE_UI
participant "DPIE API" as DPIE_API
participant "Data Processing" as DataProc
participant "Embed Code Generator" as EmbedGen
participant "External Data Source" as ExtData

== Create Embeddable Data Summary ==

DP -> DPIE_UI : Navigate to "Create Data Summary"
DPIE_UI -> DPIE_API : Request data package configuration form
activate DPIE_API
DPIE_API -> DPIE_UI : Return form to UI
deactivate DPIE_API
DPIE_UI -> DP : Display configuration form

DP -> DPIE_UI : Submit data package details\n(Selection, Filters, Visuals)
DPIE_UI -> DPIE_API : POST data package details
activate DPIE_API

DPIE_API -> DataProc : Process data package instructions
activate DataProc
DataProc -> ExtData : Fetch relevant data
activate ExtData
ExtData --> DataProc : Return requested data
deactivate ExtData

DataProc --> DPIE_API : Data package processed
deactivate DataProc

DPIE_API -> EmbedGen : Generate iframe embed code
activate EmbedGen
EmbedGen --> DPIE_API : Provide iframe code snippet
deactivate EmbedGen

DPIE_API --> DPIE_UI : Send iframe embed code
deactivate DPIE_API
DPIE_UI -> DP : Display iframe embed code

DP -> DPIE_UI : Copy iframe code

== Embedding Process ==
note over DP : Embed iframe code into target website
DP -> [Target Website] : Embed iframe code

This sequence diagram starts with the Developer/Publisher navigating the DPIE web interface to create a data summary. They submit details through a form, which the system processes by first sending these details to an API. This initiates data retrieval and processing, potentially involving fetching from external data sources. Once processed, an embed code generator creates the iframe embed code, which is then provided back to the user for embedding in target websites.

Please note, this diagram assumes a general flow and may need adjustments based on specific project requirements, technical architecture, and available APIs or services within the DPIE ecosystem.

Given the scope of the user story focusing on a new library user wanting to register in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) so they can borrow books, here is a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML code. This diagram details the interactions between the User, Frontend Interface, Server (Backend), and Database during the registration process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Server (Backend)" as Backend
database Database

User -> Frontend : Enters name, surname, credentials
Frontend -> Backend : Sends registration data
activate Backend
    Backend -> Database : Checks if user already exists
    alt If User Exists
        Database --> Backend : User Exists Error
        Backend -> Frontend : Notify user exists
        Frontend -> User : Display error message
    else User Does Not Exist
        Database --> Backend : OK to Register
        Backend -> Database : Create new user record
        Database --> Backend : User Registered Confirmation
        Backend -> Frontend : Notify registration success
        Frontend -> User : Display success message & instructions
    end
deactivate Backend

```

Explanation:
- The **User** starts the registration process by entering their name, surname, and credentials (such as email and password) into the system through the **Frontend Interface**.
- The **Frontend Interface** then sends this registration data to the **Server (Backend)** for processing.
- The **Server (Backend)** requests the **Database** to check if a user with the provided credentials already exists to prevent duplicate registrations.
- The **Database** responds:
  - If the user already exists, it sends a "User Exists Error" back to the Server, which then notifies the Front/engine that the user already exists, and an error message is displayed to the user.
  - If the user does not exist (standard path), the Database confirms that it's okay to register the new user. The Server then instructs the Database to create a new user record with the provided details.
- Upon successful creation of the new user record, the Database sends a confirmation back to the Server, which in turn notifies the Frontend of the successful registration.
- Finally, the **Frontend Interface** displays a success message to the **User**, possibly with additional instructions for verifying their email or logging into the system for the first time.

This sequence diagram outlines the system's behavior and interactions during the user registration process, highlighting the steps taken from the user's perspective to the backend operations and database interactions.

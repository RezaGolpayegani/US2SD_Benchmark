To design a sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML, we'll depict the interactions involved for a moderator viewing all items to be estimated in a session, to facilitate clarity and answer any queries related to the current story. Below is a basic example of how this might be represented using PlantUML syntax. 

This example assumes the AEPT has a structured backend where a Session Management System interacts with a Database (or similar data storage) to retrieve the list of estimation items. The moderator interacts with the AEPT through a User Interface (UI), which communicates with a backend service to fetch the required information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Moderator
participant "UI Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Backend Service" as Backend
participant "Session Management" as SessionManagement
database "Estimation Database" as Database

Moderator -> Dashboard: Request all estimation items
Dashboard -> Backend: Get all items for current session
Backend -> SessionManagement: Fetch session details
SessionManagement -> Database: Retrieve estimation items
Database --> SessionManagement: Estimation items data
SessionManagement --> Backend: Session & items data
Backend --> Dashboard: Display estimation items
Dashboard --> Moderator: Show all estimation items

@enduml
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Moderator**: Initiates the interaction by requesting to see all estimation items for the current session, to be prepared for any questions like "does this include ___?"

2. **UI Dashboard**: The interface where the moderator interacts. Upon receiving the request, it forwards the request to the backend service to fetch all items related to the current estimation session.

3. **Backend Service**: Acts as the middleware that processes the request by interacting with the session management system to retrieve the necessary data.

4. **Session Management**: A system or service responsible for handling session-related data and operations. It queries the estimation database to fetch all items tied to the requested session.

5. **Estimation Database**: Stores all data related to estimation items, among other things. It returns the requested data back to the session management system upon query.

6. **Database to Moderator (Data Flow back)**: The data flows back from the database to the moderator, showing all the estimation items through the intervening components. This allows the moderator to view all items in the session and be ready to answer specific questions about the current story.

**Note**: This sequence diagram is a simplified representation focused on the major interactions for the described user story. In actual implementation, additional interactions for error handling, authentication, and authorization may also be necessary but are excluded here for clarity. Depending on the specific architecture and technology stack of AEPT, the names and responsibilities of the components could vary.

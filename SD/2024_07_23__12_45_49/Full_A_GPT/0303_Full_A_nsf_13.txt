To create a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story: "As a user researcher, I want to have the WIG prototype, so that I can finalize the second task script", we'll define the main actors involved and the interactions that occur among systems and team members in PlantUML format. Keep in mind that "WIG" refers to a specific prototype component which in this context, we'll assume is a part of the larger NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative.

Here's how the sequence diagram could be structured in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserResearcher as UR, "User Researcher"
participant ProjectManager as PM, "Project Manager"
participant Designer as D, "Designer"
participant Developer as Dev, "Developer"
participant CMS as CMS, "CMS (Content Management System)"
participant CloudInfra as CI, "Cloud Infrastructure"

title User Researcher Obtains WIG Prototype Sequence

UR -> PM: Request prototype status
alt If Prototype is Ready
    PM -> D: Confirm prototype ready for review
    D -> Dev: Ensure prototype is deployed on beta site
    Dev -> CI: Deploy prototype on cloud infra
    CI --> Dev: Confirm deployment
    Dev -> CMS: Update prototype content
    CMS --> Dev: Confirm content update
    Dev --> D: Confirm prototype and content readiness
    D --> UR: Provide prototype for Task 2 Script
else If Prototype is Not Ready
    PM -> UR: Inform prototype development status
    UR -> PM: Request estimated prototype completion date
    PM -> Dev: Ask for updated timeline
    Dev --> PM: Provide updated timeline
    PM -> UR: Provide updated timeline
end
UR -> UR: Finalize the second task script using the prototype

Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **User Researcher (UR) initiates the process** by requesting the status of the WIG prototype from the Project Manager (PM).
2. The **Project Manager checks the status** of the WIG prototype. Here, two paths are considered:
   - If the prototype is ready, the Project Manager communicates with the Designer, who then ensures the prototype is not only ready but also communicates with the Developer to deploy it. The deployment occurs on the cloud infrastructure, and then content is updated in the CMS, ensuring everything is in place for the user researcher.
   - If the prototype is not ready, the Project Manager informs the User Researcher about the current status and follows up with the Developer for an updated timeline, which is then communicated back to the User Researcher.
3. Finally, the **User Researcher finalizes the script** for the second task, assuming the prototype is now in a suitable state for review and testing.

This PlantUML sequence diagram aims to visually represent the workflow and interaction between team members and systems for the specific user story provided.

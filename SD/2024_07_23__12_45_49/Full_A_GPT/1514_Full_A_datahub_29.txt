Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format involves defining the actors, systems, and interactions for the specified user story. Given the described Data Registry and Publishing Platform, here is how you could represent the interaction where a Consumer is searching for data packages.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Consumer
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Platform Backend" as PB
database "Data Registry" as DR

Consumer -> SI: Enter search query
activate SI

SI -> PB: Send search request(query)
activate PB

PB -> DR: Query data packages
activate DR

DR --> PB: Return search results
deactivate DR

PB --> SI: Display search results
deactivate PB

SI --> Consumer: Show search results
deactivate SI

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Consumer**: This is the actor who initiates the process, representing the user who wants to search for data packages.

2. **Search Interface (SI)**: This represents the user interface of the Data Registry and Publishing Platform where the Consumer enters their search query. It's responsible for capturing and forwarding the search request to the Platform Backend.

3. **Platform Backend (PB)**: This system component receives the search request from the Search Interface, processes it, and makes the appropriate query to the Data Registry. It acts as the intermediary layer between the user interface and the data storage.

4. **Data Registry (DR)**: This is the database or system where all the data packages are stored. It executes the search based on the query received from the Platform Backend and returns the search results.

The sequence starts with the Consumer entering a search query into the Search Interface. The Search Interface sends this query to the Platform Backend, which then queries the Data Registry for data packages matching the search terms. The Data Registry returns the search results to the Platform Backend, which in turn sends the results back to the Search Interface to be displayed to the Consumer.

This PlantUML diagram outlines a simplified flow focusing on the primary components involved in searching for data packages as per the user story. Depending on the specific implementation details of the Data Registry and Publishing Platform, additional steps or components could be involved in the process.

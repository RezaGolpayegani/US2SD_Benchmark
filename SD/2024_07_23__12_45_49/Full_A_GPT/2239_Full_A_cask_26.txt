Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the project description and user story involves outlining the interaction between the different components and actors involved in creating a pipeline that reads or writes a new dataset instance, including the creation of that dataset instance as part of the pipeline creation process. For simplicity, assumptions will be made about the interfaces and components involved, since the description provides a broad outline without specific implementation details.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor HydratorUser as user
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Pipeline Service" as Pipeline
participant "Dataset Management \nService" as DatasetService
participant "Dataset Instance \nCreator" as Creator
participant "Version Control" as VersionControl

user -> UI: Select option to create new pipeline
UI -> Pipeline: Display pipeline creation form
user -> UI: Fill in pipeline details\nand specify new dataset instance
UI -> Pipeline: Initiate pipeline and dataset creation
Pipeline -> DatasetService: Request dataset type check
DatasetService -> VersionControl: Verify dataset type and version
VersionControl --> Dataset: Provides dataset type specifications
DatasetService --> Pipeline: Dataset type confirmed
Pipeline -> Creator: Request creation of new dataset instance
Creator -> DatasetService: Create new dataset instance
DatasetService -> VersionControl: Register new dataset instance version
VersionControl --> DatasetService: Confirmation and version details
Creator --> Pipeline: Dataset instance created successfully
Pipeline --> UI: Pipeline and dataset instance creation successful
UI --> user: Display success message and pipeline details

This sequence diagram starts with the "Hydrator User" initiating the action by selecting the option to create a new pipeline through a "Web UI." The user fills in the pipeline details, including the specification for a new dataset instance. The "Pipeline Service" then coordinates with the "Dataset Management Service" to check the dataset type and its version with the help of a "Version Control" system. Once the dataset type and version are confirmed, the "Dataset Instance Creator" is called upon to create the new dataset instance, while the version control system registers this new instance and its version. Finally, the pipeline creation process is completed, and the user is notified of the successful creation through the UI.

### Note:
- The actual interactions and components may vary based on the final system architecture and design specifics that are decided upon during the development process.
- This diagram assumes a simplified view where direct calls are made between services. In a real-world scenario, these interactions could be more complex, involving message queues, event sourcing, or other asynchronous communication mechanisms.
- Additional error handling and rollback mechanisms should be included in a comprehensive design to ensure the system's robustness in the face of failed dataset or pipeline creations.

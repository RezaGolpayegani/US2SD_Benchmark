To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to see allergy warnings of order items," using PlantUML syntax, we need to break down the process that entails from the moment a waiter intends to check the allergy warnings to the actual display of this information. Here's how this interaction could be visualized:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter as waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as interface
participant "Order Management System" as orderSystem
participant "Menu Database" as menuDB
participant "Allergy Information System" as allergySystem

waiter -> interface : Select order to review
interface -> orderSystem : Request order details
orderSystem -> menuDB : Fetch order items
menuDB -> orderSystem : Return order items
orderSystem -> allergySystem : Request allergy warnings for items
allergySystem -> menuDB : Lookup allergy info
menuDB -> allergySystem : Return allergy data
allergySystem -> orderSystem : Compile allergy warnings
orderSystem -> interface : Send compiled warnings
interface -> waiter : Display allergy warnings

### Explanation:
1. **Waiter initiates the process**: The sequence begins with the waiter selecting an order to review through the Waiter Interface. This action could be a click or touch gesture on a digital device (e.g., tablet, smartphone).

2. **Fetching order details**: Next, the Waiter Interface requests details of the order from the Order Management System, which in turn fetches the ordered items from the Menu Database.

3. **Requesting allergy warnings**: With the details of ordered items, the Order Management System then requests the Allergy Information System to compile allergy warnings for these items.

4. **Looking up allergy information**: The Allergy Information System looks up the necessary allergy information from the Menu Database. This information could include ingredients, allergen notes provided by chefs, or preset alerts for common allergens related to each dish.

5. **Compiling and returning allergy warnings**: The Allergy Information System compiles the allergy warnings based on the fetched information and sends these warnings back to the Order Management System.

6. **Display of allergy warnings**: Finally, the Order Management System sends the compiled allergy warnings back to the Waiter Interface, which then displays these warnings to the waiter.

This sequence ensures that waiters have timely and accurate information about potential allergens in the dishes ordered by customers, thereby enhancing customer safety and satisfaction.

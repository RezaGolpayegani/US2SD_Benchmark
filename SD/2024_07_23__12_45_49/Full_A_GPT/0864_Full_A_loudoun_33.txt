Given the complexity and multi-step process involved in capturing a Hearing Decision within the County Services & Property Information Portal, the following PlantUML code outlines a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story. This sequence diagram demonstrates the interactions between the Staff Member, Portal Backend, Hearing Management System, and the Database, focusing on capturing a hearing decision to enforce compliance.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor StaffMember as "Staff Member"
participant PortalBackend as "Portal Backend"
participant HearingSystem as "Hearing Management\nSystem"
database Database as "Database"

== Capture Hearing Decision ==

StaffMember -> PortalBackend : Selects "Record Hearing Decision"
PortalBackend -> HearingSystem : Request to\nopen hearing record
HearingSystem -> Database : Retrieve hearing details
Database -> HearingSystem : Return hearing details

HearingSystem --> PortalBackend : Display hearing details\n(Form/Input Screen)
PortalBackend --> StaffMember : Show hearing details\nand decision form

StaffMember -> PortalBackend : Submits decision\nand corresponding details
PortalBackend -> HearingSystem : Save hearing decision
HearingSystem -> Database : Update hearing record\nwith decision

activate HearingSystem
Database --> HearingSystem : Confirm update
deactivate HearingSystem

HearingSystem --> PortalBackend : Confirmation of\nrecord update
PortalBackend --> StaffMember : Display success message\nand next steps

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Staff Member Initiates**: The process begins with the staff member initiating the action to capture a hearing decision through the portal backend. This is where they select the option to record the hearing decision.

2. **Request to Open Hearing Record**: The portal backend sends a request to the Hearing Management System to open the record of the specific hearing.

3. **Retrieve Hearing Details**: The Hearing Management System queries the Database to retrieve all relevant details about the hearing.

4. **Display Hearing Details to Staff Member**: The retrieved hearing details are sent back to the portal backend, which then displays them to the staff member, including a form or input screen for capturing the decision.

5. **Submits Decision**: The staff member submits the decision and any corresponding details back through the portal.

6. **Save Hearing Decision**: Portal backend forwards the decision to the Hearing Management System, which then updates the hearing record in the database.

7. **Confirmation of Record Update**: Once the database successfully updates the hearing record, a confirmation is sent back up the chain to the portal backend, which then notifies the staff member of the successful capture and next steps.

This diagram aligns with the user story goal by detailing the steps a staff member would take to capture a hearing decision within the County Services & Property Information Portal, emphasizing backend processes and data flow.

Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a librarian, I want to delete members" involves outlining the interactions between various system components when a librarian initiates the process to delete a member from the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format depicting this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibrarianUI
participant Authentication
participant LibrarianController
participant MemberService
participant Database

LibrarianUI -> Authentication : Authenticate(librarianCredentials)
Authentication --> LibrarianUI : AuthenticationSuccess

LibrarianUI -> LibrarianController : initiateDeleteMember(memberId)
activate LibrarianController

LibrarianController -> MemberService : requestMemberDeletion(memberId)
activate MemberService

MemberService -> Database : verifyMemberExistence(memberId)
activate Database
Database --> MemberService : MemberExists

MemberService -> Database : deleteMember(memberId)
Database --> MemberService : MemberDeleted

MemberService --> LibrarianController : deletionSuccess
deactivate MemberService

LibrarianController --> LibrarianQI : displaySuccessMessage
deactivate LibrarianController

```

### Explanation:

1. **LibrarianUI** represents the user interface through which the librarian interacts with the system.

2. **Authentication**: Before performing any administrative actions, the librarian must be authenticated. The system checks the librarian's credentials.

3. **LibrarianController**: This acts as an intermediary between the UI and service layer (MemberService), handling the request to delete a member.

4. **MemberService**: This service contains the business logic for managing members, including deleting a member's profile. It first verifies if the member exists in the database.

5. **Database**: The central repository where member information is stored. It performs operations such as verifying if a member exists and deleting a member's record.

6. The process starts with the librarian authenticating themselves to ensure secure access to administrative functionalities.

7. The librarian initiates the deletion of a member by sending the member's ID to the LibrarianController.

8. The LibrarianController forwards the request to MemberService to handle the deletion.

9. MemberService checks with the Database to ensure the member exists. If the member exists, it proceeds to delete the member from the database.

10. The Database confirms the deletion of the member to the MemberService.

11. MemberService informs the LibrarianController of the successful deletion.

12. Finally, the LibrarianController instructs the Librarian UI to display a success message to the librarian, indicating that the member has been successfully deleted. 

This sequence ensures that the process of deleting a member is handled systematically, with checks and confirmations at each step to maintain data integrity and security.

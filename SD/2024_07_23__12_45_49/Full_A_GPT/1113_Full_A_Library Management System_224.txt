To generate a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the paying subscriptions" using PlantUML, follow the code below. This diagram will illustrate the interactions between different system components (like the Manager, Web Interface, and Database) when a manager wants to view paying subscriptions.

Please note that this is a basic illustration. Depending on your specific requirements and the complexity of your system, you might need to add more elements and interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Web: Request to view paying subscriptions
activate Web

Web -> Backend: Get paying subscriptions
activate Backend

Backend -> DB: Query paying subscriptions
activate DB

DB --> Backend: Return subscriptions data
deactivate DB

Backend --> Web: Subscriptions data
deactivate Backend

Web --> Manager: Display subscriptions
deactivate Web

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:
1. **Manager initiates the request:** The manager requests to view the list of paying subscriptions through the library's web interface.
2. **Web Interface processes the request:** The web interface receives the manager's request and forwards it to the backend system to fetch the necessary data.
3. **Backend System queries the Database:** The backend system sends a query to the database to retrieve information about all paying subscriptions.
4. **Database returns data:** The database processes the request and returns the data regarding the paying subscriptions to the backend system.
5. **Backend System responds to the Web Interface:** The backend system processes the database's returned data and sends the information back to the web interface.
6. **Web Interface displays the result to the Manager:** Finally, the web interface displays the list of paying subscriptions to the manager.

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between different components in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) for the specific operation of viewing paying subscriptions by a manager. Depending on the actual functional and non-functional requirements of your project, you may need to adjust the diagram.

Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves representing the interactions between different system components and the user (depositor) in a sequence to achieve the task of allowing others to deposit on behalf of the primary user. Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram representing this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Dataset Management System" as DMS
participant "Permissions Database" as Permissions

== Allow Delegation for Data Deposit ==

Depositor -> Web: Accesses permission settings
activate Web

Web -> Auth: Request authentication
activate Auth

Auth --> Web: Authentication successful
deactivate Auth

Web -> Depositor: Show permission settings form
Depositor -> Web: Specifies delegate
Web -> Permissions: Update permissions
activate Permissions

Permissions --> Web: Permissions updated
deactivate Permissions

Web -> Depositor: Confirm delegation success
deactivate Web

== Delegation Attempt by Delegate ==

actor Delegate
Delegate -> Web: Attempts to deposit data
activate Web

Web -> Auth: Request authentication
activate Auth

Auth --> Web: Authentication successful
deactivate Auth

Web -> Permissions: Check permissions for Delegate
activate Permissions

Permissions --> Web: Permission granted
deactivate Permissions

Web -> DMS: Initiate deposit process
activate DMS

DMS --> Web: Data deposit successful
deactivate DMD

Web -> Delegate: Confirm data deposit success
deactivate Web

This sequence diagram follows these key steps for the user story requirement:

1. **Allow Delegation for Data Deposit**: The depositor accesses the permission settings through the web interface, which in turn requests authentication. Once authenticated, the depositor is presented with a form to specify another user (delegate) for data deposit tasks. The interface updates the permissions database accordingly and confirms the success of this operation to the depositor.

2. **Delegation Attempt by Delegate**: When the delegate attempts to deposit data, the system again goes through authentication. The web interface checks if the delegate has the necessary permissions from the permissions database. Upon verification, the Dataset Management System is engaged to handle the deposit, and upon success, the delegate is notified of the successful data deposit.

This diagram outlines the process involved in enabling and performing delegated data deposits in the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, emphasizing the interactions between different components and stakeholders involved in the process.

Given the complexity of creating a detailed sequence diagram for such a specific and rich functionality within the scope of this project description, I'll outline a basic framework for a PlantUML script to represent the sequence diagram for the user story: "As a user, I want to trigger a migration process for a dataset if updating its properties requires that." This framework will serve as a starting point, which you can then expand upon based on your project's specific implementation details and requirements.

### PlantUML Sequence Diagram Framework

```plantuml
@startuml

actor User as user
participant "Dataset Management\nSystem" as DMS
participant "Version Control" as VC
participant "Dataset Instance" as DI
participant "Migration Tool" as MT

== Trigger Dataset Migration Process ==

user -> DMS : requests property update\nfor dataset
DMS -> DI : validate property\nupdate requirements
alt Property Update Requires Migration
    DI -> VC : check current version
    VC --> DI : current version details
    DI -> DMS : migration required
    DMS --> user : confirmation required\nto proceed with migration
    user -> DMS : confirms migration
    DMS -> MT : initiate migration
    MT -> DI : perform migration\n(update properties, version)
    DI --> MT : migration success
    MT --> DMS : migration completed
    DMS --> user : migration successful\nproperties updated
else Property Update Does Not Require Migration
    DI -> DI : update properties
    DI --> DMS : properties updated
    DMS --> user : update successful\nno migration needed
end

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps

1. The user requests an update to the properties of a dataset through the Dataset Management System (DMS).

2. The DMS interacts with the Dataset Instance (DI) to validate if the property update requires a migration based on the dataset's current configuration and version.

3. If a migration is required:
    - The DI checks the current version with the Version Control (VC) system.
    - The VC provides the current version details back to the DI, which then indicates to the DMS that a migration is needed.
    - The DMS informs the user that a migration is necessary to proceed with the property update, requesting confirmation to proceed.
    - Upon receiving user confirmation, the DMS initiates the migration process through the Migration Tool (MT).
    - The MT performs the migration, which includes updating the properties and version of the dataset instance.
    - Upon successful completion, the MT informs the DMS of the successful migration.
    - The DMS notifies the user that the migration was successful and the properties have been updated.

4. If a migration is not required:
    - The DI directly updates its properties.
    - The DI informs the DMS that the update was successful without needing a migration.
    - The DMS then notifies the user that the update was successful and no migration was needed.

This diagram serves as a generic framework and can be modified to fit more specific scenarios or to include more detailed steps related to your project's technology stack and operational procedures.

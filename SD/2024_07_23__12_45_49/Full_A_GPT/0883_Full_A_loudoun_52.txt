Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the described user story involves mapping out the interaction between the enforcement staff member and the County Services & Property Information Portal system, focusing on the issuance of a Notice of Violation. The sequence covers the steps from initiating the process of issuing a notice to the final delivery of the notice to the responsible party.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor "Enforcement Staff" as staff
participant "User Authentication Module" as auth
participant "Violation Management System" as vms
participant "Notice of Violation Generator" as novGen
participant "Database" as db
participant "Communication Module" as comm

== Authentication ==
staff -> auth: Request to Issue Notice of Violation
auth -> auth: Verify Identity
auth --> staff: Authentication Successful

== Record Violation Details ==
staff -> vms: Access Violation Entry Form
vms -> staff: Display Form
staff -> vms: Submit Violation Details
vms -> db: Save Violation Record
db --> vms: Confirmation
vms --> staff: Violation Recorded Successfully

== Generate Notice of Violation ==
staff -> novGen: Initiate Notice Generation
novGen -> novGen: Retrieve Template
novGen -> db: Query Violation Details
db -> novGen: Provide Violation Details
novGen -> novGen: Populate Template with Details
novGen -> novGen: Generate Final Notice PDF
novGen --> staff: Notice of Violation Ready

== Send Notice of Violation ==
staff -> comm: Send Notice to Responsible Party
comm -> db: Query Contact Information
db -> comm: Provide Contact Information
comm -> comm: Email Notice
comm --> staff: Notice Sent Confirmation

This sequence diagram details the process within the system from the moment an enforcement staff member decides to issue a Notice of Violation. It starts with the staff member authenticating themselves in the system. After authentication, the staff member records the violation details, which are saved in the system's database.

Next, they initiate the generation of a Notice of Violation, which involves fetching the relevant template, pulling the saved violation details from the database, and populating the template with these details. The system then generates a final Notice of Violation document, typically in PDF format.

Finally, the diagram shows how the system sends the notice to the responsible party, including querying for contact information from the database, and using the communication module to email the notice, concluding with a confirmation of the notice being sent.

This sequence provides a high-level overview focusing on key steps and system interactions involved in issuing a Notice of Violation, following the requirements outlined in the project description.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interaction between the waiter, the system, and the chef for adding new orders. Below is a representation in PlantUML format that aims to capture this flow. 

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor or an online tool that supports PlantUML diagrams.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Waiter
participant "Restaurant Management \nand Operations System" as System
database "Database" as DB
participant Chef

title Add New Orders Process

Waiter -> System : Selects option to add new order
activate System

System -> DB : Retrieve current menu items

DB --> System : Current menu items
deactivate DB

System --> Waiter : Displays current menu items
Waiter -> System : Inputs customer's order details
activate System

System -> DB : Save new order
activate DB
DB --> System : Confirm order saved

### Breakdown of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Waiter Initiates the Process**: The waiter selects the option on the system interface to add a new order.

2. **System Retrieves Current Menu**: The system queries the database to fetch the current list of menu items available for ordering.

3. **Display Menu to Waiter**: The system presents the current menu items to the waiter.

4. **Waiter Inputs Order Details**: After discussing with the customer, the waiter enters the customer's order details into the system.

5. **System Saves New Order**: The entered order details are saved to the database by the system.

6. **Order Confirmation**: The system confirms the order has been saved and displays a confirmation to the waiter.

7. **Notification to Chef**: The system notifies the chef that a new order is available.

8. **Chef Acknowledges**: The chef acknowledges receipt of the new order notification, indicating readiness to start cooking.

### Notes:
- This sequence diagram emphasizes the flow and interaction for adding new orders through the system from the perspective of the waiter and how it informs the chef.
- Customize the diagram as per specific project requirements or technologies used. 
- The sequence demonstrates clear communication between the Waiter, System, Database, and Chef, crucial for efficient restaurant operations.

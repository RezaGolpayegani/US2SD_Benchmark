Given your request, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that illustrates the process an archivist would follow to mark groups of files as restricted. This assumes that there's a system in place as described in your project description, particularly related to Access Restriction Controls.

Please note that to use this PlantUML code, you would need to run it in an environment that supports PlantUML (e.g., an IDE that has PlantUML integration, or an online PlantUML editor).

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant Archivist as Arch
participant "File Management Interface" as FMI
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Access Control \nSystem" as ACS

== Mark Groups of Files as Restricted ==

Arch -> FMI : Select groups of files
activate FMI
FMI -> DB : Retrieve selected files' data
activate DB
DB --> FMI : Return files' data
deactivate DB

FMI --> Arch : Display files' data
deactivate FMI
Arch -> FMI : Apply restriction settings
activate FMI

FMI -> ACS : Update access permissions
activate ACS
ACS -> DB : Mark files as restricted
activate DB
DB --> ACS : Confirm restriction applied
deactivate DB

ACS --> FMI : Confirm access updated
deactivate ACS

FMI --> Arch : Display success message
deactivate FMI

**Explanation:**

1. **Archivist to File Management Interface**: The archivist selects groups of files they wish to mark as restricted within the digital archive management system.

2. **File Management Interface to Database**: The system retrieves the data of the selected files from the database.

3. **Database to File Management Interface**: The database returns the data of the selected files.

4. **Archivist to File Management Interface**: After reviewing the files' data, the archivist applies the restriction settings.

5. **File Management Interface to Access Control System**: The system updates the access permissions for the specified files by interacting with the access control system.

6. **Access Control System to Database**: The access control system marks the selected files as restricted within the database.

7. **Database to Access Control System**: The database confirms that the restrictions have been applied.

8. **Access Control System to File Management Interface**: The system acknowledges the update of the access permissions.

9. **File Management Interface to Archivist**: Finally, the file management interface displays a success message to the archivist, confirming that the groups of files have been successfully marked as restricted.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the archivist, a file management interface, the database, and an access control system to mark groups of files as restricted. It demonstrates the flow of information and actions taken to ensure restricted access to sensitive archival materials.

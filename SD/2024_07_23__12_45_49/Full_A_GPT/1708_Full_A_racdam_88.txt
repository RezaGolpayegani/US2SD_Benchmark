To create a detailed PlantUML diagram for the user story "As an archivist, I want to view collection files, so that I can gain background information for processing a collection," we would depict the interactions between the archivist and the system components involved in viewing collection files. Given your project's complexity and features, we will include components such as the User Interface (UI), Authentication Service, User Management, and the Archive File Management System. The sequence will show steps from authentication to file viewing.

Please note, to run PlantUML code, you would need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as A
participant "UI: Archive Portal" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "User Management" as UM
database "Archive File Management System" as AFMS

A -> UI : Accesses Archive Portal
UI -> Auth : Requests Authentication
Auth -> UM : Validate User Credentials
UM --> Auth : Credentials Valid
Auth --> UI : Authentication Successful
A --> UI : Selects 'View Collection Files'
UI -> AFMS : Fetch Collection Files
AFMS -> UI : Collection Files Metadata
UI --> A : Displays Collection Files

Explanation of Steps:
1. **Archivist Accesses Archive Portal**: The archivist initiates the process by accessing the digital archive portal through the UI.
2. **Requests Authentication**: The UI requests authentication from the Authentication Service to ensure the archivist is authorized to view files.
3. **Validate User Credentials**: The Authentication Service interacts with User Management to validate the archivist's credentials.
4. **Authentication Successful**: Once credentials are validated, the Authentication Service confirms the authentication success to the UI.
5. **Selects 'View Collection Files'**: The archivist selects the option to view collection files.
6. **Fetch Collection Files**: The UI requests the collection files from the Archive File Management System, which manages the digital files.
7. **Collection Files Metadata**: The Archive File Management System returns metadata of the collection files to the UI.
8. **Displays Collection Files**: Finally, the UI displays the collection files to the archivist, completing the task.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions involved in viewing collection files for an archivist. Depending on the specific implementation details of your digital archival system, additional steps or components may be necessary.

Given your request, I'll outline a PlantUML sequence diagram to illustrate the process for a Data Consuming User who wants to visualize datasets containing multiple years with a focus on the most recent year. This sequence diagram will cover interactions from selecting the dataset to visualizing it in the preferred formats.

Please note that to execute or visualize this PlantUML code, you will need to use a PlantUML environment or integrations available in many software development tools.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant User
participant "Data Selection Interface" as Selection
participant "Data Processing" as Processing
participant "Visualization Module" as Visualization
participant "Treemap Display" as Treemap
participant "Bubble Tree Display" as BubbleTree
participant "Map Display" as Map
participant "Pivot Table Display" as PivotTable

User -> Selection: Select dataset with multiple years
Selection -> Processing: Retrieve dataset details
Processing --> User: Display dataset metadata (including years available)

User -> Processing: Request visualization for most recent year
Processing -> Processing: Identify most recent year in the dataset
Processing -> Visualization: Request default visualizations for the identified year

Visualization -> Treemap: Generate Treemap
Treemap -> User: Display Treemap

Visualization -> BubbleTree: Generate Bubble Tree
BubbleTree -> User: Display Bubble Tree

Visualization -> Map: Generate Map
Map -> User: Display Map

Visualization -> PivotTable: Generate Pivot Table
PivotTable -> User: Display Pivot Table

### Explanation of the Diagram:
1. **User and Data Selection Interface**: The user selects a dataset, ideally one with multiple years of data included. This triggers a retrieval process to fetch details about the dataset.
   
2. **Data Processing**: Upon getting the dataset details, the processing component identifies the range of years available and selects the most recent year, as per the user's need for visualization.
   
3. **Visualization Module Request**: The data processing component then requests the generation of the default visualizations (Treemap, Bubble Tree, Map, and Pivot Table) specifically for the identified year.
   
4. **Visualization Displays**: Each visualization module (Treemap, Bubble Tree, Map, Pivot Table) generates the requested visualization and presents it to the user. 

This sequence encapsulates a streamlined process from the user's initial action to the final visualization outcome, catering to the specific need to focus on the most recent year's data in various visual formats.

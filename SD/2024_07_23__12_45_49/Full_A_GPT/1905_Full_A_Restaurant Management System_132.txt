Given the complexity of creating a Sequence Diagram for a system with various actors and functionalities such as a Restaurant Management and Operations System, below is an illustrative example of how you might represent the process of a manager editing a store order using Plant UML syntax. This example covers the basic interactions between the manager, the system's interface, backend services, and the database. This simplification is to provide clarity on how the sequence works. Keep in mind, the actual system might involve more steps or different interactions, especially considering error handling, authentication, and other microservices for a comprehensive system. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "UI: Management Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Backend Service: Order Management" as OrderService
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> Dashboard: Selects order to edit
Dashboard -> OrderService: Request order details [Order ID]
OrderService -> DB: Query order details [Order ID]
DB --> OrderService: Order details
OrderService --> Dashboard: Show order details
Manager -> Dashboard: Provides edited order details
Dashboard -> OrderService: Update order request [Edited Details]
OrderService -> DB: Update order in DB
DB --> OrderService: Confirm update
OrderService --> Dashboard: Update confirmation
Dashboard --> Manager: Show update success message
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the manager selecting an order to edit, which prompts interactions between the dashboard user interface (represented as "UI: Management Dashboard"), the backend order management service ("Backend Service: Order Management"), and the database ("Database"). The sequence flows from fetching the order details for the selected order to displaying those details on the dashboard, accepting the edited details from the manager, updating the order in the database, and finally confirming the successful update to the manager.

Note: This example focuses on the flow of editing an order. Depending on specific requirements, additional steps might be necessaryâ€”for instance, validation checks, logging activities for audit purposes, or notifications to relevant staff members about the order changes. Furthermore, depending on the architecture and design principles you're following (like microservices architecture), you might have more granular services involved in the process.

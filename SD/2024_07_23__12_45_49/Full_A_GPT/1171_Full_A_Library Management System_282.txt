Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a Comprehensive Library Management III (CLMS) feature where a member wants to search for books by author involves showing the interactions between the member (user), the frontend interface, the backend server, and the database systematically. Below is a representation of this functionality in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant FrontendInterface as UI
participant BackendServer as Backend
participant Database as DB

Member -> UI : Enter author name
UI -> Backend : Request books by author(authorName)
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Query books by author(authorName)
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return books list
deactivate DB
Backend --> UI : Show books list
deactivate Backend
UI --> Member : Display books by Author
@enduml
```

To visualize this diagram, you would need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML code.

Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Member (User Interaction):** The member initiates the process by entering the name of an author they are interested in into the search interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

2. **Frontend Interface:** The UI (User Interface) receives the member's input and forwards the search request to the backend server. This is typically done through an asynchronous HTTP request.

3. **Backend Server:** Upon receiving the request from the frontend interface, the backend server processes this request. It constructs a query to search for books by the specified author.

4. **Database:** The database receives the query from the backend server. It searches through its records for books that match the author name provided in the query. After the search is completed, it returns a list of matched books back to the backend server.

5. **Backend Server to Frontend:** The backend server receives the list of books from the database and then sends this information back to the frontend interface.

6. **Frontend to Member:** Finally, the UI processes the list of books and displays them to the member, allowing the member to browse through all books by their favorite authors.

This sequence diagram illustrates a straightforward interaction mechanism focusing on the book search functionality by author names within a library management system. This example can be expanded or modified to include error handling, user authentication, and other functionalities as needed for a comprehensive system design.

Given the requirement to design a sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format, below is how you might model the interactions involved in a sponsor personalizing their sponsorship page to promote their brand on the BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform.

This example assumes the sponsor is already authenticated and authorized to edit their sponsorship page.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Sponsor as sponsor
participant "Sponsorship Page" as SP
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Sponsorship Admin Module" as SAM

sponsor -> SP: Access Sponsorship Page
SP -> SAM: Verify Access Rights
SAM -> DB: Check Sponsor Credentials
DB -> SAM: Credentials Validated
SAM --> SP: Access Granted

sponsor -> SP: Select Edit Page
SP -> SAM: Load Edit Interface
SAM -> DB: Fetch Current Page Data
DB -> SAM: Return Page Data
SAM --> SP: Display Current Page Data

sponsor -> SP: Edit Page Content
sponsor -> SP: Submit Changes

SP -> SAM: Validate Changes
SAM -> DB: Update Page Information
DB -> SAM: Confirmation
SAM --> SP: Update Successful

SP --> sponsor: Display Updated Page
@enduml
```
In this sequence:
1. The Sponsor attempts to access their sponsorship page.
2. The system verifies the sponsor's access rights, checking their credentials against the database.
3. Once access is granted, the sponsor chooses to edit their page.
4. The edit interface is loaded, fetching current page data for display.
5. The sponsor makes their changes to the content and submits these changes.
6. The system validates and updates the page information in the database.
7. The database confirms the update.
8. The system notifies the page update was successful and displays the updated page to the sponsor.

This sequence diagram outlines the main interactions without going into platform-specific implementations, providing flexibility to adapt to the actual system architecture of the BADCamp Enhancement Platform.

Given your requirements, below is a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML format that outlines the interaction between different entities to demonstrate the value of visual design to the NSF project team. This approach involves several steps highlighting the process from the perspective of a Visual Designer.

**Note:** Due to the limitation of a text response, be aware that this is a basic structure. Depending on your specific tools and processes, you might need to adjust or add more steps/details.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "VisualDesigner" as vd
entity "ProjectTeam" as pt
entity "UserResearch" as ur
entity "DesignTools" as dt
database "DesignRepository" as dr
entity "CMS" as cms

== Demonstration Preparation ==
vd -> ur : Gather user research findings
activate ur
ur --> vd : Insights and Preferences
deactivate ur

vd -> dt : Create design concepts
activate dt
dt --> vd : Draft Designs
deactivate dt

vd -> dt : Develop social media wireframe
activate dt
dt --> vd : Social Media Wireframe
deactivate dt

vd -> dr : Upload designs and wireframes
activate dr
deactivate dr

== Validation and Refinement ==
vd -> pt : Present initial concepts
activate pt
pt --> vd : Feedback and Suggestions

vd -> dt : Refine designs based on feedback
activate dt
dt --> vd : Refined Designs
deactivate dt

vd -> dr : Update design repository with refined designs
activate dr
deactivate dr

== Final Demonstration ==
vd -> pt : Showcase final designs and wireframe
activate pt
pt --> vd : Approval and Appreciation

== Integration ==
vd -> cms : Provide final designs for CMS integration
activate cms
cms --> vd : Confirmation of Integration
deactivate cms

pt -> cms : Review integrated designs in CMS
activate cms
cms --> pt : Preview of Design Implementation
deactivate cms

== Training ==
vd -> pt : Conduct design training session
activate pt
pt -> pt : Acknowledge the value of visual design
deactivate pt

This sequence diagram starts with the Visual Designer gathering user research findings to inform the initial design concepts. These concepts are then presented to the project team, refined based on feedback, and finally, integrated into the CMS. Throughout the process, the Visual Designer uses design tools and maintains a repository for designs and wireframes. The demonstration of final designs and training on visual design importance aim to ensure that visual design becomes an integral part of the NSF project team's redesign process.

Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves mapping out the interaction between objects (library staff, system interface, database, etc.) over time. In this scenario, the sequence diagram will illustrate the process that a librarian follows to view books that are currently unavailable and how they handle reservations from library members in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Here's how the sequence might look in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Librarian
participant "System Interface" as Interface
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation

activate Librarian
Librarian -> Interface : Request Unavailable Books
activate Interface

Interface -> DB : Query Unavailable Books
activate DB

DB --> Interface : Return List of Unavailable Books
deactivate DB

Interface --> Librarian : Display Unavailable Books
deactivate Interface

Librarian -> Interface : Select Book for Reservation Details
activate Interface

Interface -> DB : Query Reservation Details for Selected Book
activate DB

DB --> Interface : Return Reservation Details
deactivate DB

Interface --> Librarian : Display Reservation Details
deactivate Interface

Librarian -> Reservation : Add/Update Reservation Request
activate Reservation

Reservation --> DB : Update Reservation Info
activate DB

DB --> Reservation : Confirmation of Reservation Update
deactivate DB

Reservation --> Librarian : Display Reservation Update Confirmation
deactivate Reservation

deactivate Librarian

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the librarian requesting the list of unavailable books through the system interface. The system then queries the database for this list and returns the results to the interface, which displays them to the librarian. When the librarian selects a book to see reservation details, the sequence repeats a similar interaction model to query and display those details. Finally, if the librarian decides to add or update a reservation based on a library member's request, the system interacts with the reservation system component, which in turn updates the database and confirms the update to the librarian.

This sequence diagram is a simplified view that focuses on the backend processes triggered by a librarian's actions regarding unavailable books and their reservations in the CLMS project. It assumes that the librarian is authenticated and authorized to perform these actions.

Given the complexity of the DMPTool and the specific user story provided, I'll design a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This diagram will focus on the sequence of events and interactions between the main entities involved when a researcher wants to record their intention to share data under the terms of a particular license. Please note, to visualize the diagram generated by the following code, you will need to run it through a PlantUML processor (e.g., in an IDE with PlantUML integration, an online PlantUML editor, or by using the PlantUML command-line tool).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as R
participant "DMPTool Interface" as UI
database "Metadata Repository" as MR
participant "Licensing Module" as LM
participant "External Metadata Tools" as EMT
participant "Institutional Systems" as IS

R -> UI: Access DMPTool
activate UI

UI -> MR: Retrieve existing project DMP
activate MR

MR --> UI: Display DMP details
deactivate MR

UI -> R: Show DMP details
R -> UI: Select "Add Data Sharing Intent"

UI -> LM: Request available licenses
activate LM

LM --> UI: Display license options

R -> UI: Choose specific license
UI -> LM: Record selected license
activate LM

LM -> MR: Update DMP with license details
activate MR

MR --> LM: Confirm update
deactivate MR

LM --> UI: Confirm successful record
deactivate LM

UI -> EMT: Trigger metadata synchronization
activate EMT

EMT -> MR: Update external metadata
activate MR

MR --> EMT: Confirm metadata update
deactivate MR

EMT --> UI: Synchronization complete
deactivate EMT

UI -> IS: Update institutional records
activate IS

IS --> UI: Confirm institutional update
deactivate IS

UI --> R: Display confirmation message
deactivate UI

### Description of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Researcher Accesses DMPTool:** The researcher accesses the DMPTool interface to start the process.
2. **Retrieve Existing DMP:** The DMPTool interface queries the Metadata Repository for the existing data management plan (DMP) of the project.
3. **Display DMP Details:** Details of the DMP are displayed to the researcher.
4. **Record Data Sharing Intent:** The researcher selects to add their intention to share data under a specific license.
5. **Request Available Licenses:** The Licensing Module is queried to display available data sharing licenses.
6. **Choose and Record License:** The researcher selects a license, and the Licensing Module records the selection and updates the DMP with the license details in the Metadata Repository.
7. **Metadata Synchronization:** The DMPTool triggers metadata synchronization with external metadata tools to ensure all relevant metadata reflects the data sharing intentions.
8. **Institutional Systems Update:** The institutional records are updated with the new data sharing details through interfaces with Institutional Systems.

This diagram and description provide a simplified view of the interactions involved in recording a researcher's intention to share data under specific license terms using the DMPTool.

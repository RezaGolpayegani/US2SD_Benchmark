To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to keep track of books" in PlantUML format, we will outline the interactions between the manager, the library management system's interface, and the system's backend components that facilitate book tracking. This includes viewing book lists, checking individual book details, and accessing reports on book status (e.g., availability, times borrowed).

Here's a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML to represent these actions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "Library DB" as DB

Manager -> Web : Access book tracking module
activate Web

Web -> DB : Request: Get books list
activate DB
DB --> Web : Response: Books list
deactivate DB

Web --> Manager : Display books list
deactivate Web

Manager -> Web : Select book to view details
activate Web

Web -> DB : Request: Get book details
activate DB
note right: Includes availability, \n genre, borrow times, etc.
DB --> Web : Response: Book details
deactivate DB

Web --> Manager : Display book details
deactivate Web

Manager -> Web : Request: Generate book report
activate Web
Web -> DB : Get book statistics
activate DB
DB --> Web : Book statistics data
deactivate DB
Web --> Manager : Display report
deactivate Web

@enduml
```
This sequence initiates with the manager accessing the book tracking module through the web interface. Following this, the web interface interacts with the Library Database (DB) to fetch and display the list of books. The manager can then request to view details of a selected book, prompting the web interface to retrieve detailed information from the database. Furthermore, the manager can generate a comprehensive report on the books, which involves collecting and displaying book statistics.

This diagram provides a simplistic yet comprehensive outline of the interactions involved in tracking books as a library manager. In a more detailed implementation, other components and more detailed processes, such as error handling, security checks, and real-time updates, can be added to this sequence diagram.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) would go through to pay their annual fee to ensure their CST status remains active. This sequence involves interaction between the CST user, the Scrum Alliance Community Platform web interface, the Subscription Management System, and the Payment Gateway.

Please note, to visualize this PlantUML diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor or compatible tool.

```plantuml

actor CST as "Certified Scrum Trainer"

CST -> WebInterface: Navigate to 'Renew Membership' page

### Explanation:

1. **CST navigates to the 'Renew Membership' page:** The Certified Scrum Trainer accesses the membership renewal section on the Scrum Alliance Community Platform.

2. **Retrieve CST due fees:** The platform communicates with the Subscription Management System to fetch any dues for the CST.

3. **Display due fees to CST:** The Web Interface shows the amount due for membership renewal.

4. **Display renewal fee and payment options:** The CST is presented with their renewal fee and available payment options. This point also handles the decision branch for using saved payment information or entering new payment details.

5. **Process payment request:** Once the payment method is selected (and possibly entered), the payment request is sent to the Payment Gateway for processing.

6. **Payment confirmation:** The Payment Gateway returns a confirmation status of the payment process back to the web interface.

7. **Update CST status to 'active':** Upon receiving payment confirmation, the Subscription Management System updates the CST status to 'active', ensuring their certification status remains valid.

8. **Display renewal success message:** Finally, the CST is notified via the web interface that their membership has been successfully renewed, completing the process.

This sequence diagram simplifies the process for clarity and focuses on the key interactions relevant to a CST renewing their annual membership. Additional security steps, error handling, and detailed payment processing steps would be present in a real-world scenario.

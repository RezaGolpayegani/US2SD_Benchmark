To accommodate your request for a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to keep accounts for purchased books," the following outlines a sequence involving the key interactions between a library manager and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) for adding purchased books to the library's inventory and accounting for them financially.

Please note, due to the complexity and textual limitations, the sequence diagram describes the core steps in a simplified manner. This includes initiating the process of adding a purchased book, validating manager credentials, entering book details, updating the inventory, and recording the financial transaction.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant Authentication
participant "Book Management Interface" as BookInterface
participant Database
participant "Financial System" as FinancialSystem

Manager -> Authentication: Provide Credentials
Authentication -> Manager: Credentials Validated

Manager -> BookInterface: Access Book Management
BookInterface -> Manager: Book Management Dashboard

Manager -> Book V: Initiate Add Book Process
BookInterface -> Database: Check for Duplicate
alt If Book Exists
    Database -> BookInterface: Notify Duplicate
    BookInterface -> Manager: Show Duplicate Error
else If New Book
    Database -> BookInterface: Confirm Unique Entry
    Manager -> BookInterface: Enter Book Details \n(Title, Author, ISBN, Purchase Price, etc.)
    BookInterface -> Database: Save New Book Details
    
    Database -> BookInterface: Book Added Successfully
    BookInterface -> Manager: Display Success Message
    
    Manager -> FinancialSystem: Record Purchase Details
    FinancialSystem -> FinancialSystem: Update Financial Records
    FinancialSystem -> Manager: Display Transaction Success
end

### How to Read the Diagram:

- **Participants/Actors:** Different entities involved in the process are represented as participants, e.g., Manager, Authentication, etc.
- **Interactions:** The arrows show the sequence of interactions between the entities.
- **Decisions (alt/else):** This denotes a decision point in the process, where different actions are taken based on the condition (e.g., if the book already exists in the database).

### Explanation:

1. **Authentication:** The manager provides their credentials, which are validated by the system.
2. **Book Management Dashboard:** Upon successful login, the manager accesses the book management interface.
3. **Add Book Process:** The manager initiates the process to add a new book.
4. **Duplicate Check:** The system checks if the book already exists in the library's database.
5. **Enter Book Details:** If it's a new book, the manager enters all relevant details, which are then saved to the database.
6. **Success Message:** The manager receives confirmation that the book has been successfully added.
7. **Record Purchase Details:** The manager records the purchase details in the financial system, which updates the financial records accordingly.

This sequenced interaction ensures that new book purchases are systematically added to the CLMS inventory and accounted for financially, aligning with the library manager's responsibilities and goals.

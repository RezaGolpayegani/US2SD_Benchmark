Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story in PlantUML format would involve outlining the interactions between different objects or participants in the system as a customer attempts to partially pay a bill. The sequence diagram will involve the customer, the frontend interface, possibly a payment service, and the backend server managing the database updates. 

Given the complexity and the potential for different approaches in the payment process (such as handling split payments, applying discounts, and updating the bill status), the sequence diagram provided here is simplified for clarity.

Please note, PlantUML code is written in a plain text format, and to visualize the diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML editor or an online tool that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Payment Service" as PaymentGateway
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Customer -> Frontend: Selects 'Pay Bill Partially'
Frontend -> Backend: Request to retrieve bill details
Backend -> DB: Query bill information
DB --> Backend: Return bill details
Backend --> Frontend: Display bill details
Frontend --> Customer: Shows bill with partial payment option

Customer -> Frontend: Enters partial payment amount
Frontend -> Backend: Sends partial payment request including amount
Backend -> PaymentGateway: Requests payment authorization for the amount
PaymentGateway -> PaymentGateway: Processes payment authorization
PaymentGateway --> Backend: Returns payment authorization result

alt If payment authorization is successful
    Backend -> DB: Update payment status and remaining balance
    DB --> Backend: Confirm payment update
    Backend --> Frontend: Notify payment success
    Frontend --> Customer: Show success message and updated bill
else Payment authorization fails
    Backend --> Frontend: Notify payment failure
    Frontend --> Customer: Show failure message and suggest retry
end

This sequence diagram starts with the customer choosing to pay the bill partially and ends with the system updating the bill information upon successful payment or notifying the customer of a failure in the payment process. 

- **Actors and Components:**
  - **Customer**: The person wanting to make a partial payment.
  - **Frontend Interface**: The user interface where the customer interacts.
  - **Backend Server**: Handles business logic, interacts with the database, and communicates with the payment gateway.
  - **Payment Service (PaymentGateway)**: The external service managing payment processing.
  - **Database (DB)**: Stores and updates the bill and payment information.

- **Process Flow**:
  - The customer initiates a partial payment request.
  - The backend retrieves and sends bill details to the frontend.
  - The customer submits a partial payment amount.
  - The backend requests payment authorization from the gateway.
  - Upon successful payment, the backend updates the bill status and remaining balance in the database.
  - The frontend displays an appropriate message to the customer based on the payment result.

This diagram is a basic representation. Depending on the specifics of the project, additional steps or alternative paths (such as applying discount codes, loyalty points, or handling errors more specifically) might be added to the process.

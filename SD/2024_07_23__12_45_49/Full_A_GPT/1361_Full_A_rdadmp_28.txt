Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story you mentioned involves showcasing the interactions between the user (stakeholder) and the system (DMPTool) for referencing project proposals. This sequence will likely include steps where the user requests information and the system retrieves and presents it. Below is a simplified sequence diagram written in PlantUML syntax that represents these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Stakeholder
actor DMPTool
database ProjectProposalDB

== Request Project Proposal References ==

Stakeholder -> DMPTool: Request project proposal references
activate DMPTool

DMPUtil -> ProjectProposalDB: Retrieve proposal references
activate ProjectProposalDB

ProjectProposalDB -> DMPUtil: Proposal references
deactivate ProjectProposalDB

DMPUtil -> Stakeholder: Show proposal references
deactivate DMPTool

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following process:

1. **Stakeholder requests project proposal references**: This is the initial interaction where the user expresses the need to access references to project proposals within the DMPTool platform.
  
2. **DMPTool retrieves proposal references**: Here, the tool performs the action required to fulfill the stakeholder's request. This involves interacting with a database (`ProjectProposalDB`) that stores the information related to project proposals.
  
3. **ProjectProposalDB returns proposal references**: The database responds to DMPTool's query with the requested references.
  
4. **DMPTool presents proposal references to the stakeholder**: Finally, the DMPTool displays the gathered references back to the stakeholder, completing the interaction loop.

The diagram assumes the presence of a database (`ProjectProposalDB`) that contains all the relevant data regarding project proposals. The database interactions are simplified for clarity, focusing on the essential steps in the user story. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual database schema and the complexity of the data retrieval process.

This diagram serves as a foundational structure for understanding the interactions involved in accessing project proposal references within the DMPTool system. Further details and complexities can be added based on specific project requirements and infrastructure capabilities.

Based on your request, below is a simple Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a staff, I want to display the location of a building in the library, so that I can keep track of books."

This sequence diagram assumes there is a basic flow where a staff member interacts with the library management system (CLMS) to retrieve and display a book's location within the library. The system involves interactions between the staff user interface, the system backend, and a database that stores book and location details.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant StaffMember as staff
participant "CLMS Interface" as interface
participant "System Backend" as backend
participant "Database" as db

staff -> interface: Query Book Location
activate staff
activate interface

interface -> backend: Request Book Location
activate backend

backend -> db: Fetch Book Location
activate db

db --> backend: Book Location Details
deactivate db

backend --> interface: Display Book Location
deactivate backend

interface --> staff: Show Book Location on Screen
deactivate interface
deactivate staff

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **StaffMember** (staff) initiates the process by querying the book location through the CLMS interface.
2. **CLMS Interface** (interface) receives the query and sends a request to the **System Backend** (backend) to fetch the location of the book.
3. **System Backend** (backend) then communicates with the **Database** (db) to retrieve the specific location details of the book in question.
4. **Database** (db) responds with the book location details back to the System Backend.
5. The System Backend processes this information, if necessary, and sends it back to the CLMS Interface.
6. Finally, the CLMS Interface displays the book location on the screen for the staff member.

This diagram is simplified to focus on the key entities and interactions for displaying a book's location. Depending on the project requirements, more detailed steps can be added, including error handling, security checks, and more interactive elements for the staff member.

To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the process described in the user story "As a DAMS manager, I want to know when the application of a statute to an object or object component has been modified, either manually or automatically," you would need to visualize how different components of the DIMS (DAMS Integration and Management System) interact to fulfill this requirement. Below is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax that illustrates this interaction.

Please note that due to limitations in text-based answers and the complexity of real-world applications, the following is a simplified representation intended for illustrative purposes.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DAMSManager as "DAMS Manager"
participant "Rights Management Module" as RightsModule
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Notification System" as Notify

== Modification of a Statute Application ==
DAMSManager -> RightsModule : ModifyStatute(objectId, newStatuteDetails)
activate RightsModule

RightsModule -> DB : UpdateStatuteApplication(objectId, newStatuteDetails)
activate DB
DB --> RightsModule : UpdateSuccess
deactivate DB

RightsModule -> Notify : SendModificationAlert(DAMSManagerId, objectId, modificationDetails)
activate Notify
Notify --> DAMSManager : DisplayModificationAlert
deactivate Notify

deactivate RightsModule
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

- **DAMS Manager:** Initiates the process by either manually updating the statute application to an object or by an automatic rule that triggers such a modification.
- **Rights Management Module:** This component of DIMS handles the logic for managing and applying statutes, licenses, and rights to digital assets.
- **Database (DB):** Represents the underlying database where all digital asset information, including statutes applications, is stored. The Rights Management Module sends an update request to the database to change the statute application for a specific object.
- **Notification System:** Once the modification is successfully recorded in the database, the Rights Management Module instructs the Notification System to alert the DAMS Manager of the change. This ensures that DAMS Managers are instantly aware of both manual and automatic modifications to statute applications.

This diagram is a basic representation and can be expanded or modified to fit the actual complexities and additional functionalities of the DAMS Integration and Management (DIMS). For example, the Notification System might differentiate between manual updates (initiated by users) and automatic updates (triggered by system rules or schedules) and use different notification methods or messages accordingly.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you provided involves depicting interactions between a developer, the archival management system, and possibly secondary systems or services that handle configurations. Since we focus on a situation where a developer wants to use a configuration that's not prepackaged within a built version of the application, the sequence diagram will illustrate the steps involved in identifying, loading, and using custom configurations.

Below is a basic PlantUML code snippet that illustrates these interactions. This example assumes that there's a configuration service or component within the archival management system that handles custom configurations.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant "Configuration Interface" as Config
participant "Configuration Loader" as Loader
participant "File System / External Service" as FileSystem
participant "Application Core" as AppCore

Developer -> Config : Request to use custom configuration
Config -> Loader : Check for custom config availability
Loader -> FileSystem : Load custom configuration
FileSystem -> Loader : Return custom configuration data
Loader -> Config : Custom configuration loaded
Config -> AppCore : Apply custom configuration
AppCore -> Config : Configuration applied successfully
Config -> Developer : Return success message

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the developer requesting to use a custom configuration, which isn't prepackaged within the built version of the application. The configuration interface then coordinates with a configuration loader to check and load the requested custom configuration, possibly from the file system or an external service where custom configurations are stored. Once the custom configuration is loaded and returned, it's applied to the application core. The process ends with the developer being notified that the custom configuration has been successfully applied.

Please note, this is a simplified and conceptual diagram focusing on the high-level interaction for the user story. The actual implementation details can vary based on the architectural specifics of the archival management system, including how the configurations are defined, stored, and managed.

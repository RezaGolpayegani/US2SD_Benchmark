Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram from the provided Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT) project description for the user story "As a participant, I want to scroll back through the stories and estimates from prior rounds, so that I can use this information when I estimate the item of the current round" involves illustrating the interactions between various components of the AEPT system when a participant retrieves historical estimation data. Given the complexity and multi-step nature of this interaction, the following is a simplified version of the potential sequence of actions in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ParticipantUI
participant GameSession
participant Database

ParticipantUI -> GameSession: Request for historical data
activate GameSession

GameSession -> Database: Fetch historical estimation data
activate Database
Database --> GameSession: Returns data
deactivate Database

GameSession -> GameSession: Process data for UI
GameSession --> ParticipantUI: Display historical estimations
deactivate GameSession

ParticipantUI -> ParticipantUI: Participant uses data for current estimate
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram highlights the process from the moment the participant decides to scroll through the stories and estimates from prior rounds (for consideration in their current estimate), up to the system providing that historical data for them. Here's a brief explanation of the steps involved:

1. **Request for Historical Data:** The participant uses the user interface (UI) to request historical estimation data from previous rounds.

2. **Fetch Historical Estimation Data:** The request is processed by the game session component, which then queries the Database to fetch the necessary historical data.

3. **Process Data for UI:** Once the game session component retrieves the historical data, it processes this information to be easily displayed and understood by the participant through the UI.

4. **Display Historical Estimations:** The processed data is sent back to the participant's UI, where it's displayed, allowing the participant to review previous rounds' stories and estimates.

5. **Participant Uses Data for Current Estimate:** With the historical data displayed, the participant can use this information to make a more informed estimate for the current item.

This diagram simplifies the interaction and assumes a straightforward process. However, depending on the application's complexity, additional details such as authentication checks, error handling, and interactive UI feedback could be incorporated for a more comprehensive depiction.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the outlined user story involves representing objects and the interactions between them over time. Here’s a PlantUML code snippet representing the sequence diagram for the manager tracking borrowed books, user IDs who borrowed them, and due dates to calculate fines for delayed returns within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Fine Calculator" as FineCalc

== Track Borrowed Books ==

Manager -> Web : Request borrowed books list
Web -> DB : Query borrowed books, user IDs, due dates
DB --> Web : Return borrowed books data
Web --> Manager : Display borrowed books list

== Calculate Fines for Delayed Returns ==

loop for each borrowed book
    Web -> DB : Get current date, due date for book
    DB --> Web : Return dates
    Web -> FineCalc : Calculate fine based on dates
    FineCalc --> Web : Return fine amount
    Web -> DB : Update fine in user's account
    DB --> Web : Confirm fine update
end

Web --> Manager : Display fines and updated due dates

```

Here's a breakdown of the steps represented in the PlantUML code:

1. **Track Borrowed Books:**
   - The Manager initiates a request through the Web Interface to get a list of all borrowed books along with the IDs of users who borrowed them and the due dates.
   - The Web Interface forwards this request to the Database to fetch the required information.
   - The Database returns the data back to the Web Interface.
   - The Web Interface then displays the borrowed books list to the Manager.

2. **Calculate Fines for Delayed Returns:**
   - For each borrowed book, the Web Interface queries the Database to get the current date and the due date for the book.
   - Once the dates are received from the Database, the Web Interface sends this data to the Fine Calculator to compute the fine for any delayed return based on these dates.
   - The Fine Calculator calculates the fine and returns the amount to the Web Interface.
   - The Web Interface instructs the Database to update the user's account with the new fine.
   - The Database confirms the update of the fine to the Web Interface.
   - Finally, the Web Interface displays the fine amounts and the updated information to the Manager.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation focusing on the manager’s perspective in tracking borrowed books and calculating fines for delayed returns. Each component (Manager, Web Interface, Database, Fine Calculator) plays a crucial role in the process, ensuring efficient and accurate management of borrowed books and the computation of fines within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

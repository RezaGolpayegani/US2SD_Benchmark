Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the mentioned user story requires a focus on the steps involved in searching books by subject category from a member's perspective. Here's a PlantUML code that represents these steps in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS):

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Results Interface" as Results

Member -> Search : Enter search criteria\n(Subject Category)
Search -> DB : Query books by subject category
activate DB
DB --> Search : Return list of matching books
deactivate DB
Search -> Results : Display matching books
Member -> Results : Browse books
Results --> Member : View book details

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the `Member` interacting with the `Search Interface` of the CLMS by entering their search criteria, specifically the subject category they are interested in. The `Search Interface` then sends a query to the `Database` to retrieve books that match the given subject category. Once the `Database` returns the list of matching books, the `Search Interface` processes this list and forwards it to the `Results Interface`, which then displays the matching books to the member. The member browses through the books and can view detailed information about any book they are interested in.

To view or use this diagram, you need to have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor. By inputting this code into the PlantUML environment, you'll generate a visual sequence diagram that outlines the interaction flow for a library member searching for books by subject category in the Comprehensive Library Management System.

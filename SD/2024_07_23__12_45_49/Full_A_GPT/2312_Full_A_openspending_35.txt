Given the specifications of your request, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that visualizes the interaction process for an API user who wants to normalize measures by geographical area, taking into consideration the context of working with datasets under specific contextual constraints. Please note, while this sequence illustrates a general process, actual implementations may require additional details based on system architecture and API design specifics.

```
@startuml
participant User as user
participant "API Interface" as api
participant "Data Normalization Service" as norm
participant "Geolocation Service" as geo
participant "Database" as db

user -> api : Request Data Normalization\nwith Geographical Constraints
activate api

api -> norm : Initiate Normalization Process
activate norm

norm -> geo : Request Geographical Area Information
activate geo

geo -> db : Fetch Geographical Data\n(Area, Borders, Metadata)
activate db
db --> geo : Geographical Data Response
deactivate db

geo --> norm : Geographical Area Information
deactivate geo

norm -> db : Fetch Dataset by Geographical Constraints
activate db
db --> norm : Dataset Response
deactivate db

norm -> norm : Normalize Measures\naccording to Geographical Area
norm --> api : Normalized Data
deactivate norm

api --> user : Response with Normalized Dataset
deactivate api
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the API User (User) sending a request to the API Interface (API Interface) to normalize data based on geographical constraints. The API Interface initiates the normalization process by interacting with the Data Normalization Service (Data Normalization Service). 

The Data Normalization Service requests geographical area information from the Geolocation Service (Geolocation Service), which, in turn, retrieves this data (area, borders, metadata) from the Database (Database). Once the Geographical Data is sent back to the Data Normalization Service, it uses this information to fetch the specific dataset by geographical constraints from the database.

With the dataset and geographical information at hand, the Data Normalization Service processes (normalizes) the measures according to the geographical area constraints. The service then sends the normalized dataset back to the API Interface, which finally responds to the user's initial request with the normalized dataset.

This sequence diagram aims to visualize a clear flow of interactions while providing a general framework. Depending on the actual system's complexities and API functionalities, details might vary and additional steps or services (like authentication, logging, etc.) might be included in a real-world implementation.

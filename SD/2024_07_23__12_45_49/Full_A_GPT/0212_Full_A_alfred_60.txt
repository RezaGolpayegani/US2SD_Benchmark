Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the stated user story involves illustrating the interactions between the Older Person, ALFRED (the system), and possibly other system components that work together to program and manage spontaneous questions at specified times. Here's how one might formalize these interactions in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "System Core" as Core
participant "Scheduler" as Scheduler
participant "Question Module" as QModule

== Program Spontaneous Questions ==
OlderPerson -> UI : Access Settings
UI -> Core : Request Programming Mode
Core -> UI : Display Programming Options
UI -> OlderPerson : Show Programming Options
OlderPerson -> UI : Specify Times for Questions
UI -> Core : Set Times for Questions
Core -> Scheduler : Program Question Times
Scheduler -> Core : Confirm Times Set
Core -> UI : Confirm Programming Success
UI -> OlderPerson : Show Success Message

== Time for Spontaneous Question ==
Scheduler -> QModule : Trigger Question at Specified Time
QModule -> Core : Request Question Content
Core -> QModule : Provide Question from Pool
QModule -> UI : Display Question
UI -> OlderPerson : Ask Spontaneous Question
OlderPerson -> UI : Respond to Question
UI -> QModule : Capture Response
QModule -> Core : Analyze and Store Response

This sequence diagram outlines the flow from an OlderPerson's desire to have ALFRED ask spontaneous questions at programmed times, through the process of setting these times in the system, to the system's actions when it's time to ask a question. 

- The process starts with the OlderPerson accessing settings through the User Interface (UI) and ends with the system asking a question and storing the response after the OlderPerson replies.
- The "System Core" acts as a mediator for various activities, including displaying options, setting, and confirming times for questions with the "Scheduler," and requesting and providing questions for the "Question Module."
- The "Scheduler" is responsible for triggering the "Questional Module" to ask questions at the OlderPerson's specified times.
- The separation of components like the Scheduler and Question Module showcases modularity, allowing for future expansions or modifications to these systems.

This sequence is a simplification and can become more complex based on detailed requirements such as handling exceptions (e.g., the OlderPerson not responding to a question) or integrating with other ALFRED features.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves outlining the interactions between the user, the user interface, backend systems, and possibly external services for email delivery. Given the complexity of the user story, the PlantUML code below is a simplified sequence diagram focusing on the main steps involved in generating and emailing a new password or password reminder to a user who has forgotten their password.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as usr
participant "UI: Community Platform" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend
participant "Email Service" as email

usr -> ui : Request password reset
ui -> backend : Validate request
alt Validation Success
    backend -> backend : Generate reset token
    backend -> email : Send reset email with token
    email -> usr : Password Reset Email
else Validation Failed
    backend -> ui : Show error message
    ui -> usr : Display error
end
usr -> ui : Click on reset link in email
ui -> ui : Prompt to enter new password
usr -> ui : Submit new password
ui -> backend : Validate and update password
alt Password Update Success
    backend -> ui : Confirmation of password update
    ui -> usr : Display password update success
    backend -> email : Send confirmation email
    email -> usr : Password Update Confirmation Email
else Password Update Failed
    backend -> ui : Show error message
    ui -> usr : Display error
end

This sequence diagram assumes a typical password reset flow:
1. The User initiates a password reset request.
2. The UI receives the request and forwards it to the Backend System.
3. The Backend System validates the request. If successful, it generates a reset token and uses an Email Service to send a reset email to the user. If not, an error message is displayed to the user.
4. Upon receiving the email, the user clicks on the reset link, prompting them to input a new password.
5. The new password is submitted back to the backend through the UI.
6. The Backend System validates and updates the password. If successful, it confirms the update to the UI, which then informs the user. A confirmation email is sent. If the update fails, an error message is shown to the user.

Note: This is a simplified and generic flow. Implementation details such as security considerations (e.g., ensuring the reset token is securely generated and handled, or ensuring communication is over secure channels) are crucial but beyond the scope of this high-level diagram. Likewise, error handling should be more nuanced in a real-world application.

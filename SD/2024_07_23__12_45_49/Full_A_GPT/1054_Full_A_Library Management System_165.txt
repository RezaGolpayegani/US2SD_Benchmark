Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves several components, including the user (Library Member), the front-end interface (User Interface), the application server or back-end logic (Application Server), and the database where books' data is stored (Database). Given that PlantUML is a tool used to draw UML diagrams, based on a simple and human-readable text description, below is how you could describe a sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to order books according to title."

Please note, to render these PlantUML descriptions into actual UML diagrams, you'd need to use a PlantUML processor like the one available on the PlantUML website, or integrated development environments that support PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Member as "Library Member"
participant UI as "User Interface"
participant Server as "Application Server"
database BooksDB as "Database"

== Order Books by Title ==

Member -> UI : enter search terms and select order by "title"
UI -> Server : request books ordered by title
Server -> BooksDB : query books by title\nin ascending order
BooksDB --> Server : return ordered book list
Server --> UI : display ordered books
UI --> Member : show book titles in order

In this diagram:
- The **Library Member** interacts with the **User Interface** to input their search criteria and specify that the results should be ordered by title.
- The **User Interface** sends this request to the **Application Server**.
- The **Application Sam
- The **Application Server** queries the **Database** to retrieve the book information according to the specified order.
- The **Database** returns the ordered list of books back to the **Application Server**.
- The **Application Server** then sends this information to the **User Interface**, which displays the ordered list to the **Library Member**.

This sequence ensures that the library member can efficiently find books by title in an ordered manner, enhancing the discoverability of library resources. Remember, this diagram can be customized with more details like error handling, specific search parameters, or interaction with other system components depending on the complexity and scope of your project.

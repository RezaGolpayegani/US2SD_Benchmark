Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a lab member, I want to view events and equipment bookings within the group" involves depicting the interactions between objects/system components in the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project. This diagram will focus on the necessary steps to retrieve and display events and equipment bookings for a lab group.

Considering PlantUML notation, below is an outline of how the sequence diagram can be structured to represent the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LabMember as Member
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Authorization Service" as Auth
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Event and Booking Manager" as Manager

== Accessing Events and Equipment Bookings ==
Member -> UI : Request to view events/bookings
UI -> Auth : Validate user session
Auth --> UI : Session valid
UI -> Manager : Fetch events/bookings for group
Manager -> DB : Query events/bookings data
DB --> Manager : Return events/bookings data
Manager --> UI : Display events/bookings data
UI --> Member : Shows events and equipment bookings
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Lab Member Initiates Request**: The sequence starts with the lab member requesting to view events and equipment bookings from the User Interface (UI).

2. **Session Validation**: The UI sends a request to the Authorization Service to validate the user's session, ensuring that the lab member is authenticated and authorized to view the requested information.

3. **Fetch Request Handling**: Upon successful validation, the UI interface communicates with the Event and Booking Manager. This system component is responsible for managing and processing queries related to events and equipment bookings.

4. **Database Query**: The Event and Booking Manager then queries the Database to retrieve event and equipment booking data relevant to the lab group that the member belongs to.

5. **Data Retrieval and Display**: The Database returns the requested data back to the Event and Booking Manager, which then passes this information to the UI. Finally, the UI presents the events and equipment bookings to the lab member.

This sequence diagram outlines the steps and interactions involved in enabling a lab member to view events and equipment bookings within their group on the Neurohub platform. Adjustments and enhancements might be necessary depending on the specific implementation details and project requirements.

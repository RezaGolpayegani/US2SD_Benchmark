Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story requires breaking down the interaction between the user (Applicant) and the system (County Services & Property Information Portal) into discrete steps. We'll focus on the actions involved in submitting supporting documentation as part of an application process. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Applicant
participant "User Account Authentication" as Auth
participant "Application Submission Interface" as Submission
participant "Document Upload Module" as Upload
database "Portal Backend" as Backend
database "Application Database" as AppDB

Applicant -> Auth: Access the portal
Auth -> Applicant: Request login credentials
Applicant -> Auth: Provide login credentials
Auth -> Applicant: Authentication successful

Applicant -> Submission: Initiate documentation submission
Submission -> Upload: Request to upload documents
Upload -> Applicant: Display document upload interface
Applicant -> Upload: Selects and uploads documents
Upload -> Backend: Validates document format and size
alt Document validation successful
    Backend -> Upload: Confirmation of successful validation
    Applicant -> Upload: Confirm submission
    Upload -> AppDB: Stores document metadata and link
    AppDB -> Submission: Update application status
    Submission -> Applicant: Display updated application status and success message
else Document validation failed
    Backend -> Upload: Document validation error message
    Upload -> Applicant: Display error and request re-upload
end

This PlantUML script starts with the Applicant accessing the portal and going through user authentication. Once authenticated, the Applicant initiates the documentation submission for their application through the Application Submission Interface. The sequence continues with the submission process, detailing steps like document upload, validation, and final confirmation or error handling in case of validation failure. The "Portal Backend" and "Application Database" components are responsible for the technical handling of the document, including storage and status updates related to the application. 

This diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions for submitting supporting documentation by an Applicant within the County Services & Property Information Portal system, successfully encapsulating the steps described in the user story.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a chef, I want to update allergy list" involves illustrating the interaction between the chef, the restaurant management and operations system, potentially a database, and possibly an ingredients or menu management subsystem. The sequence will show the steps taken by a chef to update the allergy list through the system.

Here is a PlantUML code snippet representing the sequence diagram for updating the allergy list by a chef:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Chef as chef
participant "Restaurant Management \nSystem" as RMS
database "Database" as DB
participant "Menu Management \nSubsystem" as MMS

chef -> RMS : Select dish to update
RMS -> MMS : Request dish details
MMS -> DB : Query dish ingredients
DB -> MMS : Return dish ingredients
MMS -> RMS : Display ingredients with allergy info
RMS -> chef : Show ingredients and current allergy list

chef -> RMS : Add/remove allergens to/from list
RMS -> MMS : Update allergy information
MMS -> DB : Update dish ingredient allergy info
DB -> MMS : Confirm update
MMS -> RMS : Confirm update to chef
RMS -> chef : Display update confirmation

```

This diagram describes the general interaction flow: 

1. **Select Dish**: The chef starts the process by selecting the dish for which they want to update the allergy list.
2. **Request Dish Details**: The restaurant management system then requests the details of this dish, specifically the ingredients, from the Menu Management Subsystem.
3. **Query Dish Ingredients**: The Menu Management Subsystem queries the database to fetch the ingredients of the selected dish.
4. **Display Ingredients**: The ingredients, along with their current allergy information, are displayed to the chef.
5. **Add/Remove Allergens**: The chef updates the allergy list by adding or removing allergens.
6. **Update Allergy Information**: The updated allergen information is sent back to the Menu Management Subsystem, which then updates the database.
7. **Confirm Update**: Finally, a confirmation of the update is sent to the chef.

This sequence covers the basic flow of updating an allergy list for a dish in a restaurant management system from the perspective of a chef. Keep in mind, this is an abstraction, and actual implementations might require additional steps or different interactions, especially concerning authentication, validation, and error handling processes.

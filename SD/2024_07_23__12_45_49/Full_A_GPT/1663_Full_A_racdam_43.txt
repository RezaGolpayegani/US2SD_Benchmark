Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the provided user story--"As a researcher, I want to order copies of photos, so that I can use them in a publication"--involves visualizing the interactions between the researcher, the digital archive system, and potentially other components involved in handling photo orders for publications. Below is a PlantUML representation of these interactions. Please note, due to the complexity of such a system, some assumptions regarding the steps involved have been made for simplicity.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant "Search Interface" as Search
database "Digital Archive" as Archive
participant "Ordering System" as OrderSys
participant "Licensing & Rights Management" as Licensing
participant "Payment Gateway" as Payment
participant "Notification System" as Notify

Researcher -> Search : searches for photos with keywords
Search -> Archive : query photos
Archive -> Search : return search results
Researcher -> Search : selects photos for ordering
Search -> OrderSys : initiate order process
OrderSys -> Licensing : check licensing and rights\nfor publication usage
Licensing -> OrderSys : return licensing info and fees
OrderSys -> Researcher : display licensing info and request confirmation
Researcher -> OrderSys : confirms order with publication details
OrderSys -> Payment : process payment info
Researcher -> Payment : enters payment details
Payment -> OrderSys : confirms payment
OrderSys -> Archive : marks photos as ordered
OrderSys -> Notify : send order and payment confirmation
Notify -> Researcher : email confirmation with order details

To use this PlantUML code:

1. Copy the code provided above.
2. Visit a PlantUML renderer or use a PlantUML plugin within a compatible IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or editor that supports PlantUML rendering.
3. Paste the code into the renderer or plugin interface.
4. Generate the diagram, which will illustrate the sequence of actions initiated by a researcher wanting to order copies of photos for publication from the digital archive system.

The diagram sequences through the actions from searching and selecting photos, checking licensing requirements and payment, to finally receiving confirmation. This basic illustration provides an overview and can be customized or detailed further depending on specific project requirements and system design.

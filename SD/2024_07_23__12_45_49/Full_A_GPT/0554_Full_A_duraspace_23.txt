To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story — "As a repository manager, I want to indicate any statutes pertinent to an object" — we'll use PlantUML syntax. This sequence diagram will illustrate the interactions between the repository manager and the DIMS system, focusing on how statutes are indicated for an object within a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS).

Please note: PlantUML diagrams can be visualized using PlantUML compatible tools or online integrations. Here's an illustrative representation in textual PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as DI
participant "Object Management Module" as OMM
participant "Rights and Licenses Module" as RLM
participant "Database" as DB

== Indicate Statutes for an Object ==

RM -> DI : Select Object
activate DI
DI -> OMM : Request Object Details
activate OMM
OMM -> DB : Query Object Information
activate DB
DB --> OMM : Object Details
deactivate DB
OMM --> DI : Display Object Details
DI --> RM : Show Object Details Screen
deactivate OMM

RM -> DI : Click on 'Indicate Statutes'
activate DI
DI -> RLM : Invoke Statutes Form
activate RLM
RLM --> DI : Display Statutes Form
DI --> RM : Show Statutes Form
deactivate RLM

RM -> DI : Fill and Submit Statutes Form
activate DI
DI -> RLM : Parse Statutes Data
activate RLM
RLM -> DB : Update Object with Statutes
activate DB
DB --> RLM : Confirm Update
deactivate DB
RLM --> DI : Confirmation of Update
deactivate RLM
DI --> RM : Show Success Message
deactivate DI

### Explanation:

1. **Repository Manager Requests to Indicate Statutes:**
   - The repository manager (RM) selects the digital object for which they want to indicate statutes.
   - The DIMS Interface is then engaged to display the details of the selected object.
    
2. **Accessing Statutes Form:**
   - The RM requests to add or update statutes pertinent to the object. The DIMS Interface opens the form from the Rights and Licenses Module (RLM) designed for this purpose.

3. **Submission of Statutes:**
   - The RM fills in and submits the form with the relevant statute information through the DIMS Interface.
   - The submission is processed by the RLM, which then updates the object's statutes in the Database.
   - Upon successful update, a confirmation message is displayed to the RM.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation meant to illustrate the process of indicating statutes pertinent to an object by a repository manager within the context of the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS). Depending on the exact implementation details and functionality of DIMS, additional steps or interactions may be necessary.

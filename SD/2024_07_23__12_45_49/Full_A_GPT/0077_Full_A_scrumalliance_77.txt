Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format detailed for the user story: "As a site visitor, I want to see a trainer's rating, so that I can choose a course from an appropriate trainer."

This diagram represents the flow of actions initiated by a site visitor wanting to view a trainer's rating on the Scrum Alliance Community Platform. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Site Visitor (Actor)**: Initiates the process by searching for a trainer. The "actor" in this context is the site visitor who is looking to view trainer ratings to make a better-informed decision.
   
2. **Search Interface (Participant)**: Represents the functionality on the platform that receives the search query from the visitor and processes it. The search interface acts as the intermediary between the site visitor and the data.

3. **Trainer Profiles (Database)**: Holds information about trainers, including their professional details, certifications, and potentially their courses. When the search is made, the profiles database is queried to retrieve a list of relevant trainers.

4. **Ratings Database (Database)**: Contains the ratings given to trainers by previous course attendees or based on some evaluation criteria. After retrieving a list of trainers matching the search, their ratings are queried from this database.

Each arrow represents the direction of communication, starting from the site visitor making a search query to displaying the trainers with their respective ratings. This sequence ensures that the site visitor receives comprehensive information to help them decide which trainer's course to enroll in, based on their ratings.

This sequence diagram is simplified to focus on the core functionality described in the user story. Depending on the project specifications, additional steps like authentication (for personalized recommendations), filtering options (e.g., by course topic, location), and error handling can be included for a more detailed understanding.

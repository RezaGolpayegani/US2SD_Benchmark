Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between the parent, the Camp Management & Communication Platform, and various subsystems such as the Database, Authentication System, and possibly Notification System based on the requirement to see a child's schedule of activities. Below is a simple PlantUML code to represent these interactions.

Please note, the PlantUML code provided here needs to be run in an environment that supports PlantUML (such as an online editor or a tool that supports PlantUML diagrams) to visualize the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Parent as parent
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Camp Management\n& Communication Platform" as platform
participant "Database" as db
participant "Notification System" as notif

parent -> platform: Request child's schedule
platform -> auth: Validate parent's identity
auth -> platform: Identity confirmed

alt If identity validation fails
    auth -> parent: Notification (Access Denied)
else Identity validation success
    platform -> db: Query child's activity schedule
    db -> platform: Return schedule data
    platform -> notif: Format schedule information
    notif -> parent: Notify parent with child's schedule
end

```

### Explanation of the Diagram:
1. **Parent Requests Child’s Schedule:** The sequence begins with the parent requesting access to their child’s activity schedule through the Camp Management & Communication Platform.
2. **Validate Parent's Identity:** The platform asks the Authentication System to verify the identity of the parent to secure access to the child's information.
3. **Decision Point - Authentication:**
   - If the parent's identity validation fails, the Authentication System sends a notification of access denied back to the parent.
   - If the validation is successful, the process continues.
4. **Query Child’s Schedule:** Post-authentication, the platform queries the Database for the child’s schedule.
5. **Database Returns Schedule:** The Database returns the child’s schedule information to the platform.
6. **Format and Notify Parent:** The platform then formats this information suitably (might be through the Notification System) and notifies the parent with the details of the child's schedule.

Note: The actual implementation might involve more complex interactions based on the system's architecture and specific requirements, such as handling multiple children, timezone adjustments, and personalized notifications. However, this diagram provides a foundational understanding of the sequence of operations for the described user story.

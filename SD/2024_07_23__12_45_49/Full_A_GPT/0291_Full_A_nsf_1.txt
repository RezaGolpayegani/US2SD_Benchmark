Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a team member, I want to see the first iteration of beta up on cloud.gov" involves outlining the steps, interactions, and components involved in deploying the first iteration of the NSF beta site to cloud.gov. This process spans several stages, from initial project setup to the deployment on cloud.gov. Please note, the representation below simplifies some interactions for clarity and focuses on key steps relevant to the deployment process.

Since the representation in a textual format might not fully capture the complexity or visual nature of a sequence diagram, I'll give you a description that translates into PlantUML syntax, which can be visualized using PlantUML tools.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant TeamMember as TM "Team Member"
participant ProjectManager as PM "Project Manager"
participant DevOps as DV "DevOps Engineer"
participant CloudGov as CG "cloud.gov Platform"

TM -> PM: Request deployment status
PM -> DV: Initiate deployment process
activate DV

DV -> CG: Login to cloud.gov
activate CG
CG --> DV: Authenticate and provide access
deactivate CG

DV -> CG: Set up cloud infrastructure\nfor beta.nsf.gov
activate CG
CG --> DV: Infrastructure setup complete
deactivate CG

DV -> CG: Configure subdomain\nbeta.nsf.gov
activate CG
CG --> DV: Subdomain configured
deactivate CG

DV -> CG: Deploy beta site iteration
activate CG
CG --> DV: Deployment successful\nURL: beta.nsf.gov
deactivate CG

DV -> PM: Confirm deployment completion\nand provide URL
deactivate DV

PM -> TM: Provide URL to beta site\nbeta.nsf.gov
TM -> beta.nsf.gov: Visit beta site

This sequence diagram starts with the team member requesting the deployment status from the project manager, who then instructs the DevOps engineer to begin the deployment process. The DevOps engineer performs several key actions on cloud.gov, such as logging in, setting up the necessary cloud infrastructure, configuring the subdomain, and finally deploying the first iteration of the beta site. Once the deployment is successful, the DevOps engineer informs the project rest of the steps occur with the project manager updating the team member on the successful deployment, providing the URL to the beta site.

To visualize this diagram, copy the PlantUML code into a PlantUML editor or tool that supports PlantUML syntax. This diagram simplifies the process to fit the key steps relevant to getting the first iteration up on cloud.gov, according to the project description and user story provided.

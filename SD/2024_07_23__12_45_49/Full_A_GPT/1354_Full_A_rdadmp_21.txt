Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format requires breaking down the user story into specific interactions among the components and actors mentioned in the project description. Given the user story of a data manager wanting to document all rights necessary for the management of data, we assume that the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) provides functionalities for documenting, storing, and accessing data management rights within its interface.

Here's a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format outlining the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager as "Data Manager"
participant DMPInterface as "DMPTool Interface"
participant MetaDataManager as "Metadata Manager"
participant RightsDatabase as "Rights Database"
participant DataManagerRepository as "Data Manager's Repository"

DataManager -> DMPInterface : Access DMPTool
activate DMPInterface

DMPInterface -> MetaDataManager : Request existing data rights documentation
activate MetaDataManager
MetaDataManager -> RightsDatabase : Query documented rights
activate RightsDatabase

RightsDatabase --> MetaDataManager : Return documented rights data
deactivate RightsDatabase
MetaDataManager --> DMPInterface : Provide documented rights info
deactivate MetaDataManager

DMPInterface --> DataManager : Display documented rights
DataManager -> DMPInterface : Identify missing rights for data management
DMPInterface -> DataManagerRepository : Request relevant legal documentation
activate DataManagerRepository

DataManagerRepository --> DMPInterface : Provide legal documents on rights
DMPInterface -> MetaDataManager : Translate legal documents to metadata format
activate MetaDataManager
MetaDataManager -> RightsDatabase : Update rights documentation
activate RightsAustralian Journal of Botany
RightsDatabase --> MetaDataManager : Confirm update
deactivate RightsDatabase
MetaDataManager --> DMPInterface : Confirm rights documentation update
deactivate MetaDataManager

DMPInterface --> DataManager : Confirm successful documentation of rights
deactivate DMPInterface

```

This sequence diagram illustrates the basic flow of a data manager documenting the necessary rights for managing data within the DMPTool. The steps are as follows:
1. The data manager accesses the DMPTool Interface.
2. The DMPTool Interface interacts with the Metadata Manager to request any existing documentation of data management rights.
3. The Metadata Manager queries the Rights Database for any documented rights and returns that information.
4. The data manager identifies any missing rights and requests relevant legal documentation from their repository of legal documents.
5. Once the legal documents are provided, they're translated into a metadata format by the Metadata Manager.
6. The Rights Database is updated with the new documentation, and the update is confirmed back to the data manager through the Metadata Manager and DMPTool Interface.

This diagram can be customized or expanded based on additional details about the DMPTool's architecture, functionalities, and interactions with other systems or external metadata tools.

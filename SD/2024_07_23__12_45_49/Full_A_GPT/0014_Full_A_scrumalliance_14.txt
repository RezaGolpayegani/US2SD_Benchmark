Given the complexity and detail of the project, creating a sequence diagram for the specific user story where an admin wants to edit a site member profile involves several components. Here's a simplified version of how this might look in PlantUML format. This example assumes the admin will authenticate, navigate to a member's profile, edit the profile, and save the changes.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Admin
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Admin Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Member Profile System" as ProfileSys
participant "Database" as DB

== Authentication ==
Admin -> Auth : Enter credentials
Auth -> Auth : Validate credentials
Auth --> Admin : Authentication Success

== Navigate to Member Profile ==
Admin -> Dashboard : Select Edit Member Profile
Dashboard -> ProfileSys : Request Member Profiles List
ProfileSys -> DB : Query Member Profiles
DB --> ProfileSys : Return Profiles
ProfileSys --> Dashboard : Display Member Profiles
Dashboard --> Admin : Show Member Profiles

== Edit Member Profile ==
Admin -> Dashboard : Select Member to Edit
Dashboard -> ProfileSys : Request Profile Details
ProfileSys -> DB : Query Member Details
DB --> ProfileSys : Member Details
Profilesys --> Dashboard : Show Member Details
Admin -> Dashboard : Edit Details (Correct Problems)
Dashboard -> ProfileSys : Update Member Profile
ProfileSys -> DB : Update Member Details in DB
DB --> ProfileSys : Confirm Update
ProfileSys --> Dashboard : Update Success Message
Dashboard --> Admin : Display Success Message

This diagram starts with the admin logging into the system, then selecting the option to edit a site member's profile. It shows the system querying the database for member profiles, the admin selecting and editing a profile, and the system updating and confirming the changes in the database.

Keep in mind that since PlantUML and the sequence diagram are simplifications, certain complexities and additional steps that might be present in a real-world application, such as error handling, logging, or detailed authentication mechanisms, are not shown here for the sake of clarity and brevity.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a librarian, I want to update information about borrowed books," we need to include several actors and systems in this process: the Librarian, the Library Management System (CLMS), and the Database. This process typically involves the librarian retrieving the book record, updating the necessary information, and then saving these updates in the database.

Here is a PlantUML script that outlines this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Librarian
participant "CLMS Interface" as CLMS
database "Library Database" as Database

Librarian -> CLMS: Selects book record to update
CLMS -> Database: Retrieve book information
Database --> CLMS: Book information
CLMS --> Librarian: Displays book information
Librarian -> CLMS: Inputs updated information
CLMS -> Database: Update book record in database
Database --> CLMS: Confirmation of update
CLMS --> Librarian: Display update confirmation

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Librarian Selects Book Record**: The librarian interacts with the CLMS interface to select the book record that needs to be updated. This could be after searching for the book by title, author, or other metadata.

2. **CLMS Requests Book Information from Database**: The CLMS sends a request to the Library Database to retrieve the current information of the selected book.

3. **Database Returns Book Information**: The Library Database returns the requested book information to the CLMS. 

4. **CLMS Displays Book Information**: The CLMS interface displays the book information to the librarian, allowing them to see what current information is stored.

5. **Librarian Inputs Updated Information**: After reviewing, the librarian inputs the updated information into the CLMS interface. This could include changes to the due date, borrower information, or condition of the book.

6. **CLMS Updates Book Record in Database**: The CLMS processes the updated information and sends an update request to the Library Database to change the book record accordingly.

7. **Database Confirms Update**: After updating the book record, the Library Database sends a confirmation of the update back to the CLMS.

8. **CLMS Displays Update Confirmation to Librarian**: Finally, the CLMS interface shows the librarian a confirmation that the book record has been successfully updated.

This sequence diagram maps out the interactions in a typical library management scenario for updating borrowed book information, demonstrating the collaboration between the librarian, the CLMS interface, and the Library Database.

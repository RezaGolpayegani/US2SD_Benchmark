Creating a detailed sequence diagram for your user story, "As a Medical Caregiver, I want to use video calls in case of emergency", involves illustrating the interactions between actors (Medical Caregiver, ALFRED System, and possibly the Older Adult) and the system components involved in initiating a video call during an emergency scenario. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that reflects these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Medical Caregiver" as Caregiver
participant "ALFRED System" as ALFRED
participant "Emergency Module" as Emergency
participant "Video Call Service" as VideoCall
participant "Older Adult's Device" as Device

Caregiver -> ALFRED : Request Emergency Assistance
note right: Caregiver detects an emergency\nand needs to initiate a video call
ALFRED -> Emergency : Trigger Emergency Protocol
Emergency -> VideoCall : Initiate Video Call Request
note over VideoCall: Video Call Service processes\nthe request and establishes connection
VideoCall -> Device : Connect Video Call
note left of Device: Older Adult's Device receives\nthe video call request
Device --> VideoCall : Acknowledge Connection
VideoCall --> Emergency : Confirm Call Establishment
Emergency --> ALFRED : Video Call Active
ALFRED --> Caregiver : Notify Video Call Status
note right of Caregiver: Caregiver is informed about\nsuccessful video call connection

### Explanation

1. **Medical Caregiver initiates the process:** The sequence begins with the Medical Caregiver recognizing an emergency and deciding to utilize the video call feature of the ALFRED system to assess and assist.

2. **System handles the request:** The ALFRED system receives the request and triggers the Emergency Protocol, which includes initiating a video call.

3. **Emergency Module:** This component is responsible for managing emergency procedures, which includes facilitating video calls during emergencies.

4. **Video Call Service setup:** The Emergency Module contacts the Video Call Service, responsible for establishing and managing video connections.

5. **Connection with Older Adult's Device:** The Video Call Service connects to the Older Adult's device, which should already be configured to receive video calls (particularly for users with ALFRED devices).

6. **Acknowledgement and Confirmation:** Once the Older Adult's device acknowledges the connection, the Video Call Service confirms the establishment back to the Emergency Module, which in turn updates the ALFRED system.

7. **Notification to the Caregiver:** Lastly, the ALFRED system informs the Medical Caregiver that the video call has been successfully connected, allowing them to proceed with the emergency assessment or assistance.

This sequence diagram focuses on the backend interactions and flow of information necessary to facilitate an emergency video call via the ALFRED system, from the perspective of a Medical Caregiver.

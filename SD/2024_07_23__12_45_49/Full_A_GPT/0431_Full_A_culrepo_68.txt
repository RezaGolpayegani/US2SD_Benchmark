Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interactions between the Cornell faculty member and different components of the digital repository system for associating a researcherID or ORCID with a submission. Please note, the diagram describes a simplified version for clarity and educational purposes:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as FM
participant "Submission Form" as SF
participant "Authentication Service" as AS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Repository System" as RS

FM -> SF: Access submission form
activate SF
SF -> AS: Request authentication
activate AS
AS -> FM: Prompt for researcherID/ORCID
FM -> AS: Provide researcherID/ORCID
AS -> DB: Validate ID against database
activate DB
DB -> AS: Confirm validity
deactivate DB
AS -> SF: Authentication successful
deactivate AS
SF -> RS: Associate researcherID/ORCID with submission
activate RS
RS -> DB: Update submission record
activate DB
DB -> RS: Confirm association
deactivate DB
RS -> SF: Association successful
deactivate RS
SF -> FM: Display success message
deactivate SF
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the flow from a faculty member's perspective when they want to associate their researcherID or ORCID with a submission to the comprehensive digital repository system at Cornell University. 

1. **FacultyMember (FM)** initiates the process by accessing the submission form on the digital repository system.
2. The **Submission Form (SF)** component interacts with the **Authentication Service (AS)** to request authentication of the researcherID or ORCID.
3. **Authentication Service (AS)** prompts the FacultyMember for their researcherID or ORCID.
4. Upon receiving the ID, **Authentication Service (AS)** checks its validity against existing records in the **Database (DB)**.
5. Once validated, **Authentication Service (AS)** notifies the **Submission Form (SF)** of the successful authentication.
6. **Submission Form (SF)** sends the association instructions to the **Repository System (RS)**.
7. **Repository System (RS)** commands the **Database (DB)** to update the submission record with the researcherID or ORCID.
8. The **Database (DB)** confirms the association back to the **Repository System (RS)**, and the **Repository System (RS)** confirms the successful association to the **Submission Form (SF)**.
9. Lastly, **Submission Form (SF)** displays a success message to the **FacultyMember (FM)**, indicating the completion of the process.

This diagram serves as a high-level representation of the sequence of actions and interactions required to associate a researcherID or ORCID with a submission in the planned digital repository system for Cornell University.

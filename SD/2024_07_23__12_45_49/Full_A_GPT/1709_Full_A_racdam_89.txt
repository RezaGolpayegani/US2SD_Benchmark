To create a sequence diagram for the user story mentioned, we will break down the interaction between the archivist (user), the system (Digital Archive Management System), and other components involved in viewing the physical locations of non-archival materials. This process might involve searching the system with specific criteria, fetching the locations from the database, and presenting the information to the archivist. Here is how you could represent this in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as archivist
participant "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as DAMS
database "Archive Database" as DB

archivist -> DAMS : Enter search criteria\nfor non-archival material
DAMS -> DB : Query for non-archival\nmaterial locations
DB -> DAMs : Return location data
DAMS -> archivist : Display non-archival\nmaterial locations
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Archivist (User Interaction)**: The archivist interacts with the Digital Archive Management System (DAMS) by entering specific search criteria to find non-archival material. This could be through a user interface specifically designed for archivist tasks.

2. **System Processing**: Upon receiving the search criteria from the archivist, the DAMS processes the request by formulating a query for the Archive Database (DB) to find the locations of non-archival materials that match the criteria.

3. **Database Query**: The Archive Database receives the query from the DAMS, performs the search within its stored data, and finds the relevant locations of non-archival materials.

4. **Result Display**: The DAMS receives the data on the non-archival material locations from the Archive Database and displays it to the archivist through the system interface.

This sequence diagram reflects the simple interaction flow for viewing the physical locations of non-archival materials based on the archivist's actions and the system's response. Depending on the project's complexity, additional steps or systems could be involved (e.g., external databases, additional verification steps, etc.).

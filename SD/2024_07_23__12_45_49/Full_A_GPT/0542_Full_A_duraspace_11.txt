To depict the user story "As a repository manager, I want to indicate names related to the collection either as creator, source, or subject" in a sequence diagram format using PlantUML, we would need first to understand the primary interactions and components involved in this feature within the DIMS context.

Assuming the DIMS architecture includes components such as the Frontend Interface (where the repository manager interacts), the Backend Server processing requests, and a Database where the collections and related names (creator, source, subject) are stored, here is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Repository Manager" as RM
boundary "DIMS Frontend Interface" as Frontend
control "Backend Server" as Backend
entity "Database" as Database

RM -> Frontend : Select collection to update
Frontend -> Backend : Request edit form for collection
Backend -> Database : Fetch collection data
Database -> Backend : Return collection data
Backend -> Frontend : Display edit form with data
Frontend -> RM : Display form

RM -> Frontend : Input/Update names (creator, source, subject)
Frontend -> Backend : Submit updated names info
Backend -> Database : Update collection with new names
alt Successful update
    Database -> Backend : Acknowledge update success
    Backend -> Frontend : Confirm update to RM
    Frontend -> RM : Display success message
else Update failure
    Database -> Backend : Notify update failure
    Backend -> Frontend : Inform RM of failure
    Frontend -> RM : Display error message
end

This diagram illustrates the interaction flow from the repository manager's perspective when they want to indicate names related to a collection, comprising of the following steps:

1. The repository manager selects the collection they wish to update through the DIMS Frontend Interface.
2. The Frontend Interface requests the edit form for the selected collection from the Backend Server, which then fetches the required data from the Database.
3. The Database sends the collection data back to the Backend Server, which forwards it to the Frontend Interface to display to the repository manager.
4. The repository manager inputs or updates the names related to the collection (i.e., creators, sources, subjects) and submits this information through the Frontend Interface.
5. The Backend Server processes this submission and updates the collection information in the Database accordingly.
6. Depending on whether the update is successful or not, the Database acknowledges the result back to the Backend Server, which then informs the Frontend Interface to display a success or error message to the repository manager.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the process flow and might need adjustments based on the specific system architecture and design of DIMS.

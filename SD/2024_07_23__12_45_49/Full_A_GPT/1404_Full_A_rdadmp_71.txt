Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format demands understanding of the interaction between the institutional data steward and various components of the DMPTool along with external systems. Given the requirements, here is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram that captures the basic flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Institutional Data Steward" as dataSteward
participant "DMPTool Interface" as interface
participant "Metadata Importer" as importer
participant "External Repository" as repository
participant "Institutional Data Catalogue" as catalogue

dataStewart->interface: Request data sets submission information
interface->importer: Fetch data submission details
importer->repository: Query submitted data sets
repository->importer: Return data sets metadata
importer->catalogue: Prepare metadata for cataloguing
catalogue->catalogue: Add metadata to institutional catalogue
importer->interface: Confirm successful addition
interface->dataSteward: Display confirmation message

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Institutional Data Steward initiates the process**: The sequence begins with the data steward requesting information about data sets that have been submitted to external repositories. This request is made through the DMPTool interface.

2. **DMPTool Interface forwards the request**: The request for data submission details is forwarded to the Metadata Importer component of the DMPTool, which is responsible for interfacing with external repositories and institutional catalogues.

3. **Metadata Importer queries the External Repository**: The Metadata Importer then sends a query to the external repository to fetch metadata of the submitted data sets.

4. **External Repository responds**: The external repository returns the requested metadata to the Metadata Importer.

5. **Metadata prepared for the Institutional Data Catalogue**: Upon receiving the metadata, the Metadata Importer prepares it to be catalogued in the institutional data catalogue.

6. **Data added to the Institutional Data Catalogue**: The Metadata Importer then adds the metadata to the institutional data catalogue, making it accessible for institutional tracking and reporting.

7. **Confirmation of successful addition**: Once the data is successfully added to the institutional catalogue, the Metadata Importer sends a confirmation back to the DMPTool interface.

8. **Data Steward receives confirmation**: Finally, the DMPTool interface displays a confirmation message to the institutional data steward, indicating that the submitted data sets have been successfully catalogued.

### Notes:
- This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and simplifies the interaction for clarity. Real-world implementations would involve more detailed steps, including authentication, error handling, and data validation.
- The notation and components used in the diagram are based on the provided project description and user story, and they might need adjustments to closely match the actual system architecture and workflows.

This diagram can be used as a starting point for further refinement and detailing as the DMPTool project progresses and more specifics about the system interactions are defined.

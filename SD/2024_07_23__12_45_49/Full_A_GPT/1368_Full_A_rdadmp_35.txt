Given the complexity and the interdisciplinary nature of the DMPTool and the requested user story, crafting a detailed sequence diagram requires a slew of technical specifics. Nonetheless, the outline provided will focus on the fundamental interactions necessary for a researcher to determine the resources needed for a project and subsequently calculate the associated costs using the DMPTool. This is a simplified and conceptual approach to what would likely be a much more elaborate process in a real-world implementation. 

Given your request, we'll sketch this process considering the involvement of the researcher, the DumpTool system (encompassing its various integrated subsystems like IT resource estimation, cost calculation, and data storage planning), and possibly external systems for cost estimation or institutional resources data.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "DMPTool Interface" as DMPTool
participant "IT Resources Estimation" as ITRE
participant "Cost Calculation Module" as CCM
participant "Institutional Systems" as IS

Researcher -> DMPTool: Access DMPTool
activate DMPTool

DMPTool -> ITRE: Request resource requirements input
activate ITRE
Researcher --> ITRE : Input project details (data volume, processing power, etc.)
ITRE --> DMPTool : Return resource estimates
deactivate ITRE

DMPTool -> CCM: Initiate cost calculation
activate CCM

CCM -> IS: Request institutional pricing data
activate IS
IS --> CCM: Return pricing data
deactivate IS

CCM --> DMPTool : Return cost estimate
deactivate CCM

DMPTool -> Researcher: Display cost estimate and resource needs
deactivate DMPTool

This sequence diagram captures a high-level view of how a researcher would interact with the DMPTool to understand the resources required for a project and calculate the related costs. It abstracts away many of the potential complexities and decision points in such a process, including:

- The detailed mechanics of interaction with external metadata tools or databases.
- Authentication and authorization steps that might be necessary for accessing different parts of the system or institutional information.
- The iterative nature of planning and calculations as a project's scope or resource availability changes over time.
- Various other stakeholder interactions which could influence resource and cost estimation (e.g., data managers, IT staff, legal advisors).

Each of these could significantly extend the sequence diagram but would require additional contexts or specific scenarios to fully flesh out.

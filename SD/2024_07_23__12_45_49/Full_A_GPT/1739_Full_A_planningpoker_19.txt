To fulfill your request, I will provide a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates the process of a moderator exporting a transcript of a game as a CSV file. This sequence involves interactions between the moderator, the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT) web interface, and the backend server responsible for handling the export functionality.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Moderator
participant "AEPT Web Interface" as WebInterface
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Moderator -> WebInterface : Selects game to export
WebInterface -> Server : Requests game data (ID: XYZ)
Server -> DB : Queries for game data (ID: XYZ)
DB -> Server : Returns game data
Server -> WebInterface : Prepares CSV file
WebInterface -> Server : Requests CSV file of game (ID: XYZ)
Server -> WebInterface : Sends CSV file
WebInterface -> Moderator : Downloads CSV file

note over Moderator
Moderator now has a CSV file of the game
transcript for further processing.
end note

This PlantUML sequence diagram describes the process as follows:

1. **Moderator selects a game to export:** The moderator initiates the process by choosing a specific game they wish to export as a CSV file.
2. **AEPT Web Interface forwards the request:** The game selection is communicated to the backend server, requesting the game's data based on its unique identification (ID).
3. **Backend Server retrieves game data:** The server then queries the database for the requested game data using the game's unique ID.
4. **Database returns game data:** Upon retrieving the game's data, the information is sent back to the server.
5. **Server prepares the CSV file:** With the game data available, the server formats and prepares a CSV file containing the relevant game details for export.
6. **AEPT Web Interface requests the CSV file:** Once the CSV file is ready, the web interface requests the file from the server.
7. **Server sends the CSV file to the Web Interface:** The server responds by providing the prepared CSV file to the web interface.
8. **Web Interface enables the Moderator to download the CSV file:** Finally, the moderator is offered the option to download the CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping purposes.

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified interaction during the CSV export process in the context of the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool, emphasizing the moderator's perspective in exporting game transcripts.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting interactions between the system components and the user (in this case, the Principal Investigator or PI) necessary to accomplish the task of planning what kind of data to store. Below is a simplified PlantUML code to illustrate these interactions focusing on the specific functionalities related to data storage planning within the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant PI as "Principal Investigator"
participant UI as "DMPTool Interface"
participant DMP as "Data Management Plan"
database MetadataDB as "Metadata Database"
participant IRM as "IT Resource Manager"
participant DM as "Data Manager"

PI -> UI : Log in to DMPTool
UI -> DMP : Create/Edit Data Management Plan
DMP -> UI : Show Data Storage Planning Section
PI -> UI : Input data storage needs
UI -> DMP : Record storage needs
DMP -> MetadataDB : Update Metadata with Storage Plan
MetadataDB -> DMP : Confirm Update
UI <- DMP : Display Updated Plan
PI -> UI : Request IT Resource Assessment
UI -> IRM : Trigger IT Resource Evaluation
IRM -> IRM : Assess IT Resource Requirements
IRM -> DMP : Update Plan with IT Recommendations
DMP -> DM : Notify Data Manager of New Plan
DM -> MetadataDB : Review & Approve Data Storage Plan
MetadataDB -> DMP : Confirm Approval
UI <- DMP : Show Approval and Recommendations
PI <- UI : Receive Updated Plan and IT Recommendations

This sequence diagram starts with the Principal Investigator logging into the DMPTool and involves creating or editing a data management plan, specifically focusing on the section for planning data storage. The diagram shows the process of the PI inputting data storage needs, updating the plan's metadata, triggering an IT resource evaluation, and receiving updates and recommendations based on IT and Data Manager assessments.

Please note, this is a high-level representation. Depending on the specific functionalities and workflows of the DMPTool, more detailed steps or different components might be involved. For a comprehensive and accurate design, close collaboration with technical teams and a clear understanding of the system's architecture would be required.

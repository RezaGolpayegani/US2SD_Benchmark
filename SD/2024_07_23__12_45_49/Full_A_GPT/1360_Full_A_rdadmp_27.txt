Given the complexity and broad scope of the DMPTool project, illustrating a sequence diagram for the specified user story requires focusing on interaction between roles (users) and the system to accomplish the described need. The user story focuses on identifying the responsible party for the DMP within the system. Here's how this interaction can be diagrammed using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Stakeholder
participant DMPTool_System as System
participant Database

== Identify DMP Owner ==

Stakeholder -> System : Request DMP owner information
System -> Database : Query for DMP responsible
Database --> System : Return DMP owner details
System --> Stakeholder : Display DMP owner information

```

Explanation:
1. **Stakeholder**: This is the user initiating the request to find out who is responsible for the Data Management Plan (DMP). Stakeholders can be researchers, IT managers, legal officers, or anyone with a vested interest in the research data management process.

2. **DMPTool_System (System)**: This represents the central platform or the DMPTool's software system that coordinates activities, information lookup, and interactions between different users and the data repository.

3. **Database**: This is where all data associated with DMPs, including metadata on ownership and responsibility, are stored. The database is queried by the DMPTool system to fetch the information needed.

In this sequence, the stakeholder makes a query through the DMPTool system to request information on who is responsible for a specific DMP. The system then processes this request by querying its database to retrieve the DMP owner's information. Once this information is obtained, it is then presented back to the stakeholder by the system.

Please note, this sequence diagram is simplified and does not include error handling, authentication, or other potential intermediary steps involved in such a transaction for clarity and conciseness. It assumes that the stakeholder has appropriate permissions to view DMP owner details and that such a workflow is supported directly through interactions with the DMPTool system.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story, "As a repository manager, I want to indicate subjects related to the collection," involves illustrating the system components interaction sequence when a repository manager assigns subjects to a collection. Here's how you could represent this user story in a PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as DI
participant "Collection Management" as CM
database "DAMS Database" as DB

RM -> DI : Select Collection
DI -> CM : Fetch Collection Details
CM -> DB : Query Collection Data
DB --> CM : Collection Data
CM --> DI : Display Collection Data
DI --> RM : Show Collection Details

RM -> DI : Indicate Subjects for Collection
DI -> CM : Update Collection with Subjects
CM -> DB : Update Collection Subjects
DB --> CM : Confirm Subjects Updated
CM --> DI : Update Confirmation
DI --> RM : Display Update Success Message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the repository manager selecting a collection for which they want to indicate subjects. The DIMS Interface then communicates with the Collection Management system to fetch and display the chosen collection's details. After viewing the details, the repository manager proceeds to indicate the desired subjects for the collection through the DIMS Interface. The Collection Management system then updates the collection's record in the DAMS Database with the new subjects and confirms the update to the DIMS Interface, which in turn notifies the repository manager of the successful update with a message.

This visualization details the process flows and interactions between the repository manager, DIMS Interface, Collection Management system, and the DAMS Database specifically for the process of indicating subjects related to a collection within a Digital Asset Management System.

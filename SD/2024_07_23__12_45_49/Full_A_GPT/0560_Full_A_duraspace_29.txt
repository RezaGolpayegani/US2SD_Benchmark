To fulfill your request, we'll create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates the process flow when a DAMS manager wants to know what collection(s) an object belongs to within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS). This diagram will represent the interactions among different components and actors to achieve this use case.

Please note that the specific implementation details can vary based on the existing DAMS architectures, and the example below is a simplified representation for conceptual understanding.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "DAMS Manager" as damsmgr
participant "DIMS Interface" as interface
participant "Authentication Module" as auth
participant "Collection Management" as collection_mgmt
database "DIMS Database" as db

== Authentication Sequence ==
damsmgr -> interface: Request collection info for object
interface -> auth: Initiate authentication
auth -->> damsmmrg: Authentication request
damsmgr -> auth: Provide credentials
auth -> db: Validate credentials
db -->> auth: Authentication response
auth -->> interface: Authentication successful

== Collection Retrieval Sequence ==
interface -> collection_mgmt: Retrieve collection(s) for object
collection_mgmt -> db: Query object to find collection(s)
db -->> collection_mgmt: Collection(s) details
collection_mgmt -->> interface: Display collection(s) information
interface -->> damsmgr: Show collection(s) object belongs to

To use this example:
1. Copy the PlantUML code provided above.
2. Use any PlantUML editor or an online tool that supports PlantUML (like planttext.com, or the PlantUML Google Chrome Application).
3. Paste the copied code into the editor.
4. The editor should render the sequence diagram based on the supplied code.

This diagram illustrates a simplified flow where:
- The DAMS manager requests information on which collection(s) a specific object belongs to through the DIMS interface.
- The request initiates an authentication process to ensure that the user has the appropriate access rights.
- Upon successful authentication, the DIMS interface communicates with the collection management component to retrieve the relevant information.
- The collection management component queries the database to find out which collection(s) the specified object belongs to.
- The information is then passed back to the DIMS interface, which presents it to the DAMS manager. 

Remember, this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. The actual implementation may involve a more complex set of interactions, especially in systems with advanced security, multiple repositories, or additional layers of interaction.

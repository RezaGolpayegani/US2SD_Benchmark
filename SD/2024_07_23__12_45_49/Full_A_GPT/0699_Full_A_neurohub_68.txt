Given your request, below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that captures the interactions involved in moving multiple files around and rearranging them within the Neurohub file browser as part of data processing. This example assumes a simplified process where a user selects multiple files, triggers a move action, and the system processes this request.

```
@startuml
autonumber
actor User as U
participant "UI File Browser" as UIFB
participant "Server" as S
database "File System" as FS

== File Selection ==
U -> UIFB: Selects multiple files
UIFB -> S: Sends file identifiers and "start move" request
S -> FS: Checks file status
FS --> S: Returns file status (e.g., available)
S --> UIFB: Confirms files are movable

== File Moving ==
U -> UIFB: Specifies new location and confirms move
UIFB -> S: Requests move with file IDs & target path
S -> FS: Executes move operation
FS --> S: Move success confirmation
S --> UIFB: Confirms move completion
UIFB --> U: Displays files in new location

```

In this sequence, the interactions are straightforward and focus on the essentials of file moving within the Neurohub platform:

1. **File Selection**: The user selects multiple files for moving using the platform's UI. The UI communicates with the server to check the files' statuses to ensure they are available and can be moved.

2. **File Moving**: After the user specifies the new desired location for the files and confirms the move, the UI conveys this action to the server. The server then instructs the file system to execute the move operation. Once the move is successfully performed, the server notifies the UI, which then updates to reflect the files' new location to the user. 

This diagram assumes a simplified view of interactions and does not cover error handling, authentication, or more complex scenarios where files might not be moveable due to permissions, locks, or other constraints. Depending on the project's complexity and requirements, additional steps or components (such as validation, audit logging, or notification services) may be necessary.

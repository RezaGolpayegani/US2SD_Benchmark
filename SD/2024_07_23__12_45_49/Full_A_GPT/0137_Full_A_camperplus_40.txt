Given the context of the project, creating a sequence diagram for the specified user story involves modeling the interaction between various components or actors within the system to fulfill the parent's request. Here's a PlantUML code snippet to illustrate this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

participant Parent as P
participant WebInterface as W
participant Server as S
participant Database as DB

P -> W : Access platform & authenticate
activate W
W -> S : Request for counselor info\n[User ID, Child's ID]
activate S
S -> DB : Query assigned counselors\n[Child's ID]
activate DB
DB --> S : Return counselor details
deactivate DB
S --> W : Display counselors' info
deactivate S
W --> P : Show counselors’ names & info
deactivate W

### Explanation of Each Step:

1. **Parent Accesses Platform & Authenticates**: The parent logs into the Camp Management & Communication Platform through its web interface. Authentication is essential for ensuring the privacy and security of the information.

2. **Request for Counselor Information**: Once authenticated, the parent navigates to the section of the platform where they can view information about their child. They select an option to view the counselors assigned to their kid. This action triggers a request from the Web Interface to the Server, including necessary identifiers such as the User ID of the parent and the Child's ID.

3. **Query Assigned Counselors**: The Server processes this request and interacts with the Database to fetch details about the counselors assigned to the specified child. This involves executing a query that filters counselor assignments based on the Child's ID.

4. **Return Counselor Details**: After the Database retrieves the information, it sends back the details of the assigned counselors to the Server.

5. **Display Counselors' Information**: The Server then processes this information and sends it back to the Web Interface, which organizes it into a user-friendly format.

6. **Show Counselors’ Names & Information**: Finally, the parent is presented with the information about the counselors assigned to their child, including names and possibly other relevant details such as contact information or profiles. 

This sequence diagram outlines a straightforward interaction flow, ensuring that the process of a parent seeking information about their child's assigned counselors on the Camp Management & Communication Platform is depicted accurately. Remember, this is a high-level representation and actual implementation details may involve additional steps or components based on the platform's architecture and security requirements.

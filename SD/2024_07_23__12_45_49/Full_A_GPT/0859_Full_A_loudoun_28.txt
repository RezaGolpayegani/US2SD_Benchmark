Given the user story's requirements, below is an example of a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate how a staff member can manage hearing calendars to track hearing-related activities and due dates within the County Services & Property Information Portal.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff as S
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Staff Dashboard" as Dash
participant "Hearing Calendar Management" as HCM
participant "Database" as DB

S -> Auth: Login
Auth -> S: Authentication Success

S -> Dash: Access Hearing Calendar Module
activate Dash
Dash -> HCM: Request to View Hearing Calendar
activate HCM
HCM -> DB: Query Scheduled Hearings
DB -> HCM: Return Hearings Data
HCM -> S: Display Hearing Calendar
deactivate HCM

S -> HCM: Request to Add New Hearing

This sequence diagram starts with a staff member logging in through the authentication system. Once authenticated, the staff member accesses the hearing calendar module from the staff dashboard. They can then view the current hearing calendar, add new hearings, modify existing hearings, or delete hearings as needed. Each of these operations involves interactions with the database to retrieve, insert, or update hearing-related information, with success messages displayed to the staff member upon completion of these actions.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interactions between different system components and actors to achieve the said functionality. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents a sequence diagram for the user story: "As a superuser, I want to view users' stats, so that I can view in real-time how many users have visited my recycling center information and their recyclable waste."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SuperUser as SU
participant "Dashboard Interface" as Dashboard
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Analytics Engine" as Analytics
participant "Notification Service" as Notify

== Authentication ==
SU -> AuthService : authenticate(superuser credentials)
AuthService -> DB : validate_credentials(superuser_id)
DB --> AuthService : credentials_valid
AuthService --> SU : authentication_success

== Viewing User Stats ==
SU -> Dashboard : select(View User Stats)
Dashboard -> Analytics : request_stats(recycling_center_id)
Analytics -> DB : fetch_user_visits_and_waste(recycling_centre_id)
DB --> Analytics : visit_data, waste_data
Analytics --> Dashboard : compile_stats(visit_data, waste_data)
Dashboard --> SU : display(stats)

== Notifications ==
Analytics -> Notify : check_if_stats_update_needed()
Notify --> Analytics : update_needed
Analytics -> Notify : generate_notification(superuser_id, stats_summary)
Notify -> SU : send_notification(stats_update)

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Authentication**: The superuser starts by authenticating themselves with their credentials. The authentication service verifies these credentials against the database. If validated, the authentication process is successful, and the superuser gains access to the dashboard.
  
2. **Viewing User Stats**:
   - The superuser selects to view user stats from the dashboard.
   - The dashboard requests the analytics engine for stats related to a specific recycling center.
   - The analytics engine fetches data from the database regarding user visits and the type of recyclable waste for that recycling center.
   - The database returns the necessary data to the analytics engine, which then compiles the stats.
   - The compiled stats are sent back to the dashboard, which then displays them to the superuser.

3. **Notifications**:
   - Concurrently, the analytics engine checks if there are stats updates needed to be notified to the superuser.
   - If an update is necessary, the analytics engine generates a notification summary and instructs the notification service to send this update to the superuser.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of operations initiated by a superuser's desire to view user statistics related to visits and recyclable waste contributions to their recycling center, completed with authentication steps and real-time notification features for updated stats.

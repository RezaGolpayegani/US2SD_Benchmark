Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to see the availability of books, so that I can borrow an available one" involves illustrating the interaction between components like the user interface (UI), controllers, and the database within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). For context clarity, the PlantUML code below visualizes the process starting from the library member's book search request to displaying the book's availability.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "BookController" as controller
database "Library Database" as db

== Check Book Availability ==

member -> web : Enter search criteria\n(title, author, subject, etc.)
web -> controller : Request book availability
controller -> db : Query books matching criteria
db -> controller : Return book details\n(including availability)
controller -> web : Show available books
web -> member : Display book availability and details

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Library Member Interaction**: The sequence begins with the library member (user) entering search criteria into the Web Interface of the CLMS. This could be searching for a book by its title, author, publication date, or subject category.

2. **Request Processing**: The Web Interface sends this search request to the BookController, a component responsible for handling book-related operations within the system.

3. **Database Query**: The BookController then queries the Library Database with the provided search criteria to find matching books. The Library Database holds all the data concerning books, including their availability.

4. **Result Processing**: After the Library Database processes the query, it returns the details of the books that match the criteria to the BookController. The details include important information like the book's title, author, and crucially, its availability status.

5. **Displaying Results**: The BookController processes this information and sends it back to the Web Interface, which then displays the available books and their details to the library member. 

6. **Member Decision Point**: At this stage, the library member can decide whether to borrow an available book based on the information provided.

This sequence diagram assumes a simple and direct process for checking book availability within the Comprehensive Library Management System, focusing on the main interactions that occur between the user, system interfaces, and database during the book search and selection process.

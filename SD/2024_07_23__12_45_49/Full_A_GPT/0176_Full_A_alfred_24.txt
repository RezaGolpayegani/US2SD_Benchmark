Certainly! Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram code snippet illustrating the user story: "As an Older Person, I want to have an ALFRED device that can be easily adapted for users that have hearing trouble." This diagram focuses on the interactions required to adapt the ALFRED device for a user with hearing impairments.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as "Older Person"
participant "ALFRED Interface" as Interface
participant "Settings Module" as Settings
participant "Audio Adjustment" as Audio
participant "Visual Notifications" as Visual

This sequence diagram outlines how an older person interacts with the ALFRED device to adjust settings for hearing impairments. The process starts with the older adult activating the device and accessing the settings through the ALFRED interface. Within the settings, they adjust audio settings like increasing volume and enabling speech-to-text functionality. Additionally, they configure visual notifications, including enabling LED alerts and text notifications, to accommodate their hearing troubles. Once the adaptations are confirmed and applied, the device indicates to the older person that the adaptations have been successfully applied.

This depiction assumes that the ALFRED device has a straightforward user interface that older adults can navigate with ease and includes specific functionalities catered to various impairments, in this case, hearing. This approach ensures accessibility and personalization, key elements in assistive technology for the elderly.

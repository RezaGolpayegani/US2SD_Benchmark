Given your needs, here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates the user story of a member registering to the system with their details to borrow books from the library.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Registration Page" as RP
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Member -> RP : Enter name, surname, credentials
RP -> Backend : Validate input data
alt validation successful
    Backend -> DB : Create new member record
    alt Record Created Successfully
        DB --> Backend : Return Success Message
        Backend --> RP : Display registration successful message
        RP --> Member : Show success & prompt to explore books
    else Record Creation Failed
        DB --> Backend : Return Error
        Backend --> RP : Display error message
        RP --> Member : Show error & prompt to try again
    end
else validation failed
    Backend --> RP : Display validation error
    RP --> Member : Show validation error & prompt correction
end

This PlantUML code sketch illustrates the interaction between a new member trying to register on the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the front-end registration page, the system's backend, and the database where user records are stored.

Key steps involved:
1. **Member Input**: The prospective member inputs their name, surname, and credentials into the registration form on the webpage (Registration Page).
2. **Data Validation**: The system's backend validates this input data. If the data does not meet the validation criteria (e.g., formatting issues, missing fields), the registration process stops, and the member is prompted to correct the input.
3. **Database Interaction**: Upon successful validation, the backend sends a request to create a new user record in the database. The outcome can either be successful, leading to a confirmation message displayed to the user, or it can fail (due to reasons like server issues or duplicate records), resulting in an error message prompting the user to try again.

This sequence ensures that members are registered correctly and efficiently, enabling them to borrow books from the library upon successful registration.

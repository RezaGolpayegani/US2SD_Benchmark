Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story specified requires identifying the key actors, systems, and interactions involved in viewing and utilizing a DOI for a dataset, especially in the context of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform described in your project. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines this scenario. This sequence diagram takes into account the steps a data reuser would follow, from accessing the platform to fetching the DOI of a specific dataset for use in reference management software.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataReuser as "Data Reuser"
participant WebInterface as "Web Interface"
participant SearchEngine as "Search Engine"
participant DatasetMetadata as "Dataset Metadata"
participant DOIService as "DOI Service"
database DataArchive as "Data Archive"

== View Dataset DOI ==
DataReuser -> WebInterface: Access platform & search for dataset
WebInterface -> SearchEngine: Initiate search
SearchEngine -> DataArchive: Query datasets
DataArchive -> SearchEngine: Return search results
SearchEngine -> WebInterface: Display datasets
WebInterface -> DataReuser: Show search results
DataReuser -> WebInterface: Select dataset
WebInterface -> DatasetMetadata: Request dataset details
DatasetSetMetadata -> DataArchive: Fetch dataset details
DataArchive -> DatasetMetadata: Return dataset details & DOI
DatasetMetadata -> WebInterface: Display dataset details & DOI
WebInterface -> DataReörper:rens  Show DOI and export options
DataussRe bowlser --> RalphInterface:naństw7  Request DOI copy or export
WebInterface -> DOIService: Retrieve DOI link
DOIService -> WebInterface: Provide DOI link
WebInterface -> DataReuser: Offer DOI link & export instructions
DataReuser -> DOIService: Use DOI in reference management software

This PlantUML sequence diagram begins with the data reuser accessing the web interface of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform and searching for a dataset. The search engine then queries the data archive to return relevant datasets. The user selects a dataset, and the platform retrieves and displays its details, including the DOI. The sequence concludes with the data reuser using the DOI link in their reference management software, following the instructions provided by the platform's web interface.

The scenario showcases the interaction between the data reuser and various components of the platform, ensuring that the user can easily access and utilize the DOI for future reference and management of the dataset in their academic work.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to see other users profiles" using PlantUML, follow these steps. The diagram outlines the interaction between a User and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) specifically for viewing other users' profiles. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "UI" as UI
participant "UserController" as UserController
participant "UserService" as UserService
participant "UserRepository" as UserRepository

User -> UI : Selects 'View Profiles'
UI -> UserController : viewOtherUserProfiles()
activate UserController

UserController -> UserService : getOtherUserProfileDetails()
activate UserService

UserService -> UserRepository : findUserProfiles()
activate UserRepository

UserRepository --> UserService : userProfileData
deactivate UserRepository

UserService --> UserController : userProfileDetails
deactivate UserService

UserController --> UI : displayUserProfiles(userProfileDetails)
deactivate UserController

UI --> User : Shows User Profiles
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **User**: The actor who wishes to view other users' profiles in the library management system.

2. **UI (User Interface)**: The graphical interface where the user interacts with the system. It's the initial point of contact for the user's request.

3. **UserController**: This controller receives the request from the UI to view other users' profiles and forwards the request to service layer (UserService) for further processing.

4. **UserService**: The service layer that handles the business logic for the user's request. It asks the UserRepository to fetch the necessary data.

5. **UserRepository**: Represents the data access layer that queries the database for user profile information and returns the data to the UserService.

6. **Sequence of Events**:
   - The User selects the option to view profiles on the UI.
   - The UI sends this request to the UserController.
   - UserController forwards the request to UserService to process this action.
   - UserService requests UserProfile data from UserRepository.
   - UserRepository sends the user profile data back to the UserService.
   - UserService then returns this information to the UserController.
   - UserController sends the data back to the UI to be displayed to the User.

This PlantUML sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions required to fulfill the user story of viewing other users' profiles in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described User Story using PlantUML might look something like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as user
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Hierarchy Management" as HM
participant "Database" as DB


user -> UI: Selects archival object
activate UI

UI -> HM: DragStartEvent(archival object)
activate HM

HM -> UI: Show valid drop targets
UI -> user: Display drag overlay

user -> UI: Drops object at new position
UI -> HM: DropEvent(new position)
HM -> DB: Query parent object ID
activate DB

DB -> DB: Validate new position
DB -> HM: Return success and update needed

HM -> DB: Update object hierarchy
DB -> DB: Save new hierarchy
DB -> HM: Confirm hierarchy updated

HM -> UI: Display updated hierarchy
deactivate DB
deactivate HM

UI -> user: Show success message
deactivate UI

Explanation:
- The Archivist (user) initiates the interaction by selecting and dragging an archival object in the User Interface (UI) of the Comprehensive Archival Management System.
- The UI communicates with the Hierarchy Management (HM) component, signaling the start of a drag action with the selected object.
- The HM component requests the UI to show valid drop targets based on the object's current position and potential new position within the hierarchy.
- As the user decides on a new position and 'drops' the object, the UI captures this DropEvent and informs the HM of the new position.
- The HM performs a series of checks and updates. It queries the Database (DB) to get the parent object ID of the new position to ensure the move is valid within the existing hierarchy.
- Database validations and updates occur, including checking for any conflict or constraint that might prevent the new hierarchy arrangement.
- Once the DB confirms the updates, the HM component instructs the UI to display the updated hierarchy, reflecting the changes.
- Finally, the UI shows a success message to the Archivist, indicating that the archival object has been successfully rearranged within the hierarchy.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions between different components when an Archivist wants to rearrange the resource description hierarchy. Depending on the system's architecture, additional steps or components (e.g., authentication, logging, or event handling) could also be involved in this process.

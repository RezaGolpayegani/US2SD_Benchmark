To visualize the user story "As a manager, I want to see membership information" as a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, you need to depict the interactions among the system components from the moment the manager initiates the request to view membership information until the system displays it.

The sequence diagram below outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Manager Interface" as MI
participant "System API" as API
participant "Membership Management Module" as MMM
database "Library Database" as DB

Manager -> MI: Request to view membership information
activate MI

MI -> API: Retrieve membership information
activate API

API -> MMM: Get membership data
activate MMM

MMM -> DB: Query membership records
activate DB

DB --> MMM: Return data
deactivate DB

MMM --> API: Membership data
deactivate MMM

API --> MI: Display membership information
deactivate API

MI --> Manager: Show membership information
deactivate MI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Manager requesting to view membership information through the Manager Interface (MI). The MI, upon receiving this request, interacts with the System API to fetch the necessary details. The System API then delegates this request to the Membership Management Module (MMM), which is responsible for handling all membership-related data.

The MMM communicates with the Library Database (DB) to query the requested membership records. Upon receiving the requested data from the DB, the MMM passes the data back to the System API, which subsequently sends the information to MI. Finally, the MI displays the membership information to the Manager, completing the request.

This visual representation highlights the sequence of interactions involved in fetching and displaying membership information, ensuring the Manager gets the needed data efficiently.

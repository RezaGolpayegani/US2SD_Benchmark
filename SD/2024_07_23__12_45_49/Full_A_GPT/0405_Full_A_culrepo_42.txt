To create a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story using PlantUML syntax, we'll focus on the interactions between the user (patron) and the digital repository system, highlighting the steps involved in browsing content by author or subject area. Here is a representation of such interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Patron
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant Database

Patron -> Search: Input search criteria (author or subject)
activate Search

Search -> CMS: Query content by criteria
activate CMS

CMS -> Database: Fetch matching content
activate Database

Database --> CMS: Return results
deactivate Database

CMS --> Search: Provide content listings
deactivate CMS

Search --> Patron: Display search results
deactivate Search

Patron -> Search: Select content to view details
activate Search

Search -> CMS: Retrieve content details
activate CMS

CMS -> Database: Fetch content details
activate Database

Database --> CMS: Return content details
deactivate Database

CMS --> Search: Provide content details
deactivate CMS

Search --> Patron: Display content details
deactivate Search

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Patron initiating a search by inputting the desired criteria (either an author's name or a subject area) into the Search Interface. The Search Interface relays this query to the Content Management System (CMS), which then queries the Database for matching content. The Database returns the results to the CMS, which in turn sends them back to the Search Interface to display to the Patron.

The Patron browses the search results and selects a piece of content to view more details. This selection triggers another interaction from the Search Interface with the CMS, requesting detailed information for the specific content. The CMS fetches these details from the Database, returns them to the Search Interface, which ultimately displays the content details to the Patron.

This diagram assumes a simplified view focusing on the key steps involved in the process of browsing and selecting content. Depending on the project's complexity and specific requirements, additional elements like authentication, error handling, or direct content viewing and download functionalities might also be integrated into the sequence.

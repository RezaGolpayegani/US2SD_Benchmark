To create a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format, we need to illustrate the interaction between the Broker user and the various system components involved in syncing D1 file generation with the FPDS data load. This example shows the steps involved in this process, from the initial check for updated data to the final generation of the D1 file only if the data has been updated.

Please note, the following sequence diagram is a high-level representation and assumes some procedures (like authentication, detailed error handling, and system-to-system communications) are abstracted for clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor BrokerUser as User
participant "Broker Platform" as Broker
participant "Data Validation Service" as Validation
participant "FPDS System" as FPDS
participant "File Generation Service" as FileGen

== Check for FPDS Data Updates ==
User -> Broker: Request D1 file generation
Broker -> FPDS: Check for data updates since last D1 file
alt Data has been updated
    FPDS -> Broker: Confirm data update
    Broker -> Validation: Validate new FPDS data
    Validation -> Broker: Validation complete
    Broker -> FileGen: Generate D1 file with new data
    FileGen -> Broker: D1 file generation complete
    Broker -> User: Provide D1 file
else No data update
    FPDS -> Broker: No data update
    Broker -> User: Inform no D1 file generation needed
end

This diagram starts with the Broker user requesting the D1 file generation. The Broker platform then checks with the FPDS (Federal Procurement Data System) for any data updates since the last D1 file generation. If the FPDS system confirms that new data is available, this data is validated by the Data Validation Service. Upon successful validation, the File Generation Service takes over to generate the D1 file with the new data, and finally, the Broker platform provides the generated D1 file to the user. If there are no updates in the FPDS data, the user is informed that no new D1 file generation is needed, thus avoiding unnecessary file regenerations. 

Remember, this is a simplified visualization. Real-world systems may include more steps, such as detailed error handling, notification services for job completion, and more intricate interactions with external systems for data verification and validation.

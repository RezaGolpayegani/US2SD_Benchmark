Given your request, below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate the process of automatically calculating fines for late checkouts as experienced by a library staff member in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

This scenario begins when a staff member triggers the fine calculation process for a member (borrower) who has overdue items.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Staff as S
participant "Library System" as LS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Finance Module" as FM
participant "Notification System" as NS

S -> LS : Request fine calculation\nfor overdue items
LS -> DB : Verify overdue items\nfor specified member
DB -> LS : Return list of overdue items
LS -> FM : Calculate fines based on\noverdue items and policy
FM -> LS : Return calculated fines
LS -> DB : Update member account\nwith fines
DB -> LS : Confirm fine update
LS -> NS : Trigger fine notification\nto member
NS -> LS : Confirm notification sent
LS -> S : Display fine calculation\nand notification status

### Breakdown of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Staff to Library System**: The sequence starts with a library staff member (S) initiating the fine calculation process for a borrower who has overdue items. This is a signal to the Library System (LS) to begin the operation.

2. **Library System to Database**: The LS makes a request to the Database (DB) to verify which items are overdue for the specified library member. This involves checking the due dates against the current date.

3. **Database to Library System**: The DB returns a list of all overdue items for the member in question back to the LS.

4. **Library System to Finance Module**: With the overdue items identified, the LS requests the Finance Module (FM) to calculate the fines. The calculation is based on the number of overdue days and possibly the categories of items (different fines for books, DVDs, etc.).

5. **Finance Module to Library System**: The FM calculates the total fines based on the library's policies and returns this information to the LS.

6. **Library System to Database**: The LS then instructs the DB to update the member's account with the newly calculated fines.

7. **Database to Library System**: The DB confirms that the member's account has been updated with the new fine amounts.

8. **Library System to Notification System**: Subsequently, the LS requests the Notification System (NS) to send a notification to the member regarding their overdue items and the corresponding fines.

9. **Notification System to Library System**: The NS confirms that the fine notification has been sent to the member.

10. **Library System to Staff**: Finally, the LS displays a confirmation of the fine calculation and notification status to the staff member, completing the process.

This sequence diagram encapsulates the automated process of identifying overdue items, calculating fines, updating the borrower's account, and notifying them of the fines, as handled within a comprehensive library management system.

To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the provided user story using PlantUML, we start by identifying the key actors, entities, and interactions. The main actors in this user story are the **Site Visitor** and the **System**. The **System** represents the back-end processes, including the course listing interface and the trainer's profile handling.

For simplicity, let's consider the essential steps involved in this user interaction:
1. The Site Visitor views a list of courses.
2. The Site Visitor clicks on a trainer's name associated with a course.
3. The System fetches the trainer's profile details.
4. The System displays the trainer's profile to the Site Visitor.

Here is how you can represent this interaction in a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Site Visitor" as visitor
participant "Course Listing Page" as coursePage
participant "System" as system
participant "Trainer Profile Page" as trainerProfile

visitor -> coursePage : Views courses
activate coursePage

coursePage -> system : Request list of courses
activate system

system -> coursePage : Return list of courses
deactivate system

coursePage -> visitor : Display courses
deactivate coursePage

visitor -> coursePage : Selects Trainer's Name
activate coursePage

coursePage -> system : Request Trainer Profile based on selection
activate system

system -> trainerProfile : Fetch Trainer Profile
activate trainerProfile

trainerProfile -> system : Return Trainer Profile details
deactivate trainerProfile

system -> coursePage : Deliver Trainer Profile
deactivate system

coursePage -> visitor : Display Trainer's Profile
deactivate coursePage

@enduml
```

This PlantUML code outlines a sequence of interactions starting from the Site Visitor's perspective wanting to view a course and subsequently clicking on the trainer's name to view their profile. The System plays a crucial anchor role by fetching and delivering the necessary data between the Course Listing Page and the Trainer Profile Page to fulfill the Site Visitor's request.

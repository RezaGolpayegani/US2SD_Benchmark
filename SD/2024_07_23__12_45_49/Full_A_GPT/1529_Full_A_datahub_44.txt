Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the provided user story "As a Publisher, I want to be able to get access to a previous version I tagged, so that I can return to it and review it" involves illustrating the interaction between different system components such as the Publisher (user), User Interface (UI), Server, Versioning System, and Data Storage. 

Below is a textual representation of a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format capturing these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "UI" as UI
participant "Server" as Server
participant "VersioningSystem" as Versioning
participant "DataStorage" as Storage

Publisher -> UI : Select "Manage Data Packages"
UI -> Server : Request tagged versions list
Server -> Versioning : Query tagged versions
Versioning -> Storage : Fetch metadata for tagged versions
Storage -> Versioning : Return metadata
Versioning -> Server : List of tagged versions
Server -> UI : Display tagged versions
UI -> Publisher : Show list of tagged versions

Publisher -> UI : Select a version to review
UI -> Server : Request selected version
Server -> Versioning : Query specific version details
Versioning -> Storage : Fetch version data
Storage -> Versioning : Return version data
Versioning -> Server : Specific version details
Server -> UI : Display version details
UI -> Publisher : Show version data

This sequence diagram starts with the Publisher deciding to manage data packages through the UI. The system fetches and displays a list of tagged versions from the data storage via the Versioning System. The Publisher then selects a tagged version to review, initiating another sequence where the system fetches detailed information about the selected version for review.

Note: This is a simplified representation focusing on major steps and interactions. Depending on the implementation details of the Data Registry and Publishing Platform, there might be additional complexities and steps involved, such as authentication checks, error handling, logging, and more granular interactions with the data storage and versioning system.

Please, adjust and extend this diagram as necessary to fit the specific requirements and system design of your Data Registry and Publishing Platform project.

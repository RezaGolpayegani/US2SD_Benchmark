Given the project description and the specified user story, a sequence diagram in PlantUML format would illustrate the interactions between the moderator, the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT) web interface, and the backend services to add an item to the list of items to be estimated. Note that the details might vary based on the specific requirements and architecture of the AEPT system. Below is a simplified example to illustrate these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Moderator
participant "AEPT Web Interface" as WebInterface
participant "Backend Service" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

== Add Item to Estimation List ==

Moderator -> WebInterface : Selects "Add New Item"
WebInterface -> Moderator : Shows "Add Item" form

Moderator -> WebInterface : Submits new item details
WebInterface -> Backend : Request to add new item
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Insert new item into database
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Confirm item added
deactivate DB

Backend --> WebInterface : Item Added Successfully
deactivate Backend

WebInterface --> Moderator : Display success message

@enduml
```

**Explanation of the Sequence:**

1. **Interaction Start**: The moderator selects the option to "Add New Item" to the estimation list.
2. **Display Form**: The web interface then prompts the moderator with a form to input the new item details.
3. **Form Submission**: The moderator fills in the necessary details (e.g., item name, description) and submits the form.
4. **Request Processing**: The web interface sends a request to the backend service to add the new item.
5. **Database Update**: The backend service processes this request and attempts to insert the new item into the database.
6. **Confirmation**: Once the database confirms the item has been added, the backend service relays this confirmation back to the web interface.
7. **Success Message**: Finally, the web interface notifies the moderator that the item has been successfully added.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the process. Actual implementations may require more detailed interactions, especially regarding error handling, validation, and the interaction patterns between the frontend and backend services.

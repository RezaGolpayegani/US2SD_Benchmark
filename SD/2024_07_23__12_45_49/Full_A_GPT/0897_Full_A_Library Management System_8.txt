Given the complexity and the various subsystems involved in your project, the sequence diagram for the user story **"As a customer, I want to delete which book has the monthâ€™s most reads"** will focus on interactions between the customer, web interface, controller, recommendation engine, and the database. However, it's important to note that typical library management systems may not allow customers to directly delete records related to book statistics, as this might be an administrative task. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume this feature is implemented with certain restrictions.

Below is the PlantUML code to create the sequence diagram, which assumes that the customer is allowed to request the deletion but an administrator or system check might be ultimately responsible for the action performed.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Customer as cust
participant WebInterface as web
participant Controller as cont
participant RecommendationEngine as rec
participant Database as db

cust -> web: Request to view most read book this month
web -> cont: Fetch most read book
cont -> rec: Query most read book this month
rec -> db: Retrieve book data
db -> rec: Book data
rec -> cont: Most read book details
cont -> web: Display book details
web -> cust: Show most read book details

cust -> web: Request to delete most read book record
web -> cont: Delete request for most read book
cont -> rec: Check if deletion criteria met
rec -> cont: Criteria not met (or met, for admins)
cont -> web: Deletion denied (or approved for admins)
web -> cust: Show deletion status

In this sequence diagram, the process starts with the customer requesting to view which book has been read the most this month. After the initial request and display process, the customer then requests to delete the record for the most read book. The system checks if the deletion criteria are met, which typically might involve administrative permissions. Hence, for a standard customer, the request to delete such a record would likely be denied, with the system returning a message indicating the status of the deletion request.

Remember, this is an idealized scenario that assumes certain functionalities which may not be typical of all library management systems, especially regarding data deletion by a customer. For actual implementation, adjustments should be made to reflect correct permissions and roles within the system.

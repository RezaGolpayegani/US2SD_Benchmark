Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story - "As a depositor, I want to deposit and maintain datasets through Pure, so that I have a single one-stop shop for managing my research outputs." - involves mapping interactions between the depositor and various system components of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, particularly focusing on the integration with Pure. Here is a PlantUML script that illustrates these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Pure Integration Module" as Pure
participant "Dataset Management System" as DMS
database "Bath Data Archive" as Archive

Depositor -> WebUI: Access deposit interface
activate WebUI

WebUI -> Pure: Request authentication
activate Pure
Pure --> WebUI: Authenticate depositor
deactivate Pure

WebUI -> Depositor: Show dataset deposit form
Depositor -> WebUI: Fill in form \n(Include metadata, files)
WebUI -> DMS: Process deposit form
activate DMS
DMS -> Pure: Check if dataset metadata aligns \nwith Pure requirements
activate Pure
Pure --> DMS: Confirm metadata alignment
deactivate Pure

DMS -> Archive: Deposit dataset and metadata
activate Archive
Archive --> DMS: Confirm deposit \nGenerate DOI
DMS -> Pure: Link dataset DOI with Pure records
activate Pure
Pure --> DMS: Update Pure records
deactivate Pure

DMS --> WebUI: Confirm dataset deposit \nProvide DOI to depositor
deactivate DMS
WebUI -> Depositor: Display confirmation \n(Include DOI link)

deactivate WebUI
@enduml
```

This diagram visualizes the flow from when a depositor decides to submit a dataset to when the dataset is successfully deposited in the Bath Data Archive and linked with Pure. Key interactions include:

1. The depositor accesses the web interface to start the submission process.
2. The web interface communicates with Pure for authentication purposes.
3. Once authenticated, the depositor is presented with a dataset deposit form.
4. After the depositor submits the filled form, the Dataset Management System processes this information, checking metadata alignment with Pure's requirements.
5. The dataset and its metadata are then deposited in the Bath Data Archive, which generates a DOI for the dataset.
6. The Dataset Management System updates Pure records with the new dataset DOI.
7. Finally, the depositor receives confirmation of the successful deposit, including the DOI link.

This sequence diagram aims to simplify complex interactions into understandable steps for developers and stakeholders involved in the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform project.

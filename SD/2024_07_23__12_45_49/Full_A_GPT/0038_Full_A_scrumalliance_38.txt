Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating how various system components interact with each aother to achieve the goal of maintaining a FAQ section. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions for the given user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant SiteEditor as SE
participant Dashboard as DB
participant FAQManagementSystem as FAQ
database FAQDatabase as DBS

SE -> DB: Log in to dashboard
activate DB

DB -> SE: Display dashboard options
SE -> FAQ: Select manage FAQ option
activate FAQ

FAQ -> DBS: Retrieve existing FAQs
activate DBS

DBS -> FAQ: Return existing FAQs
FAQ -> SE: Show current FAQs

SE -> FAQ: Add/Update/Delete FAQ
activate FAQ
FAQ -> DBS: Update FAQ database
activate DBS

DBS -> FAQ: Confirm update
FAQ -> SE: Show update confirmation

deactivate DBS
deactivate FAQ
deactivate DB
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the site editor logging into the administrative dashboard. After accessing the dashboard, the editor selects the option to manage the FAQ section. The FAQ Management System then retrieves and shows existing FAQs from the database. The site editor can perform actions such as adding new FAQs, updating existing ones, or deleting unnecessary FAQs. These changes are updated in the FAQ database, and the FAQ Management System confirms the updates to the editor.

To view or edit this diagram:

1. Install PlantUML or use an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy and paste the provided code snippet into the PlantUML environment.
3. Generate the diagram to visualize the sequence of interactions for maintaining a FAQ section by a site editor.

This sequence diagram is simplified to focus on the main interactions and might miss intricate details of authentication, error handling, and other background services involved in the process.

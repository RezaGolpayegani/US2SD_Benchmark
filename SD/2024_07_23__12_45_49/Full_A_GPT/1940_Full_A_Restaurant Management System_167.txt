Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a manager, I want to remove resources so that I won't track the resources I won't have anymore" involves illustrating how different components of the system interact to achieve the desired functionality. This process involves the manager initiating the resource removal request, the system processing the request, and updating the database accordingly.

The following sequence diagram script depicts this interaction in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management System" as MS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> MS : Selects resource to remove
activate MS

MS -> DB : Query resource details
activate DB
DB --> MS : Resource details
deactivate DB

MS -> MS : Verify manager authorization
MS -> DB : Remove resource from inventory
activate DB
DB --> MS : Confirm resource removal
deactivate DB

MS --> M : Display removal confirmation
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

To use this script:

1. Make sure you have PlantUML installed or access to an online PlantUML editor.
2. Copy the PlantUML script above.
3. Paste it into your PlantUML environment and generate the diagram.

This diagram starts with the Manager selecting the resource they want to remove. The Management System queries the Database for the resource details, verifies the manager's authorization to remove the resource, and proceeds to update the database to reflect the removal. Once complete, a confirmation of the removal is sent back to the Manager.

This simplifies the otherwise complex processes into distinct, manageable interactions that fulfill the user story's requirement. Remember, the diagram can be adjusted based on specific project needs or technologies used.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story that involves looking up books by various criteria like title, author, subject category, and publication date can be quite intricate due to the multiple systems and processes involved. Below, I provide a PlantUML code representation that visualizes this flow within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

This diagram assumes the system has a front-end interface (likely a web application) that interacts with a backend server, which then queries a database.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant User
participant WebApplication as WA
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

User -> WA: Enter search criteria\n(title, author, category, publication date)
WA -> BS: Request book search\n(criteria)
alt If search criteria is valid
    BS -> DB: Query books\n(criteria)
    DB --> BS: Return results
    BS --> WA: Display search results
    WA --> User: Show books list
else If no results found
    BS --> WA: Display no results message
    WA --> User: Show no results found
else If invalid criteria
    BS --> WA: Show error message
    WA --> User: Prompt to correct criteria
end

### Explanation:

- **User**: The individual using the system to find books.
- **WebApplication (WA)**: Represents the front-end interface of the CLMS. This is what the user interacts with.
- **BackendServer (BS)**: The server-side component that processes requests, fetches data, and performs business logic.
- **Database (DB)**: Contains all the data of the library system, including books, authors, categories, etc.

1. The **User** starts by entering search criteria (title, author, subject category, and publication date) through the Web Application.
2. The **Web Application** sends these criteria to the **Backend Server**.
3. The **Backend Server** checks if the criteria are valid:
    - If they are, it queries the **Database** using the criteria.
    - The **Database** returns the search results to the Backend Server.
    - The Backend Server then sends these results back to the Web Application.
    - The Web Application displays the list of books matching the criteria to the User.
    
    - If no results are found, the process informs the User that no books match the search.
    - If the criteria are invalid (e.g., using disallowed characters or formats), the system prompts the User to correct the input.

This sequence diagram focuses on the flow of operations when a library member wants to look up books by specific criteria, showcasing the interactions between the user, the web application, the server, and the database.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the exact steps and interactions between the actor (employee) and the components of the system when editing the menu to delete missing products. Here's how a sequence diagram for this user conversion could be represented using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as employee
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "Menu Management System" as menu
participant "Database" as db

employee -> ui : Selects option to edit menu
ui -> auth : Verify employee credentials
auth --> ui : Credentials valid
ui -> menu : Request current menu data
menu -> db : Query existing menu items
db --> menu : Return menu items
menu --> ui : Display menu items
employee -> ui : Selects missing products to delete
ui -> menu : Send delete request for products
menu -> db : Delete product entries
db --> menu : Confirm deletion
menu --> ui : Update menu display
ui --> employee : Show updated menu

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the employee interacting with the UI interface to edit the menu. The system then verifies the employee's credentials through an Authentication Service. Upon successful verification, the Menu Management System requests the current menu data from the database. The database provides the menu items, which are then displayed to the employee. The employee selects the missing products they want to delete, and this change is sent to the Menu Management System, which updates the database accordingly. Finally, the updated menu is displayed to the employee, confirming the deletion of the missing products.

Keep in mind, PlantUML visuals cannot be displayed here, but you can copy this syntax into a PlantUML editor or viewer to generate the sequence diagram. This will visually illustrate the steps outlined in the sequence, from the initial user action to the systems' responses and the final outcome.

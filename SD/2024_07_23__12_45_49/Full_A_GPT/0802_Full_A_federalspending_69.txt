Creating a sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting the interaction between different system components and roles to implement the desired feature. Note that the actual implementation details may vary depending on the specific architecture of the Broker platform. However, the following is an illustrative example of what the PlantUML code could look like for this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FABSUser as "FABS User"
participant Frontend as "Frontend Service"
participant Router as "Routing Service"
participant Controller as "Controller"
participant ViewEngine as "View Engine"
database URLMappingDB as "URL Mapping Database"

FABSUser -> Frontend : Accesses page via URL
activate Frontend
Frontend -> Router : Request page
activate Router

Router -> URLMappingDB : Query URL Mapping
activate URLMappingDB
URLMappingDB --> Router : Return mapping details
deactivate URLMappingDB

Router -> Controller : Invoke corresponding action
activate Controller
Controller -> ViewEngine : Request page rendering
activate ViewEngine

ViewEngine -> Controller : Return rendered page
deactivate ViewEngine
Controller --> Router : Send rendered page
deactivate Controller

Router --> Frontend : Serve page to user
deactivate Router
Frontend --> FABSUser : Display page
deactivate Frontend
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process starting from the FABS user accessing a page through a URL, which is handled by the frontend service. The request is then forwarded to a routing service that queries a URL mapping database to find the appropriate controller action to invoke. The controller requests the view engine to render the page, which is then returned back through the chain to the frontend service, and finally, the rendered page is served to the user.

This generic sequence diagram can be adapted to the specific technologies and architectures used by your broker platform. Additionally, while it reflects the process of improving URL accuracy for frontend pages, specific details about how these mappings are defined or updated are not covered and will depend on the platform's technical design and implementation.

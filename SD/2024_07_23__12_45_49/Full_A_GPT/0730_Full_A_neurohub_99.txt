Given the scope of your project description, the following PlantUML sequence diagram outlines a rough sketch for the user story of a Junior Researcher wanting to harvest knowledge from within the group. This diagram focuses on key interactions between the user, the system interface (UI), and the backend system functionalities related to accessing shared documents, engaging with collaboration tools, and utilizing search capabilities to find relevant experiments and research data.

Please note, this is a high-level representation and may need adjustments based on the specific implementations and technologies your project uses.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant JuniorResearcher as JR
participant "UI/Portal" as UI
participant "SearchEngine" as SE
participant "Database" as DB
participant "CollaborationTool" as CT

JR -> UI: Access Neurohub Portal
UI -> JR: Display Dashboard

alt Access Shared Documents
    JR -> UI: Navigate to Shared Documents
    UI -> DB: Query shared documents
    DB -> UI: Return shared documents list
    UI -> JR: Display shared documents
    JR -> UI: Select Document to View
    UI -> DB: Fetch Document Details
    DB -> UI: Return Document Details
    UI -> JR: Display Document
end

alt Search for Research Data/Experiments
    JR -> UI: Search for specific keywords
    UI -> SE: Pass search query
    SE -> DB: Fetch relevant data
    DB -> SE: Return search results
    SE -> UI: Display search results
    UI -> JR: Show search results
    JR -> UI: Select result to explore further
    UI -> DB: Fetch detailed information
    DB -> UI: Return detailed information
    UI -> JR: Display detailed information
end

alt Engage with Collaboration Tools
    JR -> UI: Navigate to Group Collaboration Tools
    UI -> CT: Fetch available tools and discussions
    CT -> UI: Return tools and discussions
    UI -> JR: Display tools and ongoing discussions
    JR -> UI: Post New Comment/Question
    UI -> CT: Update discussion thread
    CT -> UI: Confirm update
    UI -> JR: Display updated thread
end

### Explanation:
- **JuniorResearcher (JR)** represents the actor initiating the actions.
- **UI/Portal** symbolizes the Neurohub user interface through which the junior researcher interacts.
- **Database (DB)** represents the underlying data storage that holds information on shared documents, research data, experiments, and so on.
- **SearchEngine (SE)** is the system's search functionality that helps the researcher find relevant documents, datasets, or experiments based on keywords.
- **CollaborationTool (CT)** represents the platform's built-in collaboration features allowing users to engage with their peers, share knowledge, and discuss research findings.

This diagram illustrates a simplified flow where the junior researcher accesses shared documents, utilizes the search engine to find relevant research data or experiments, and engages with built-in collaboration tools to learn from experienced researchers. Adjustments may be necessary to align the diagram with the specific workflows and technologies used in your project.

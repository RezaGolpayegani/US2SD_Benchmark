Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interactions between the cook, the system (including its various components like inventory management, menu management, and database), and potentially suppliers for restocking purposes. Here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Cook
participant MenuManagement as "Menu Management\nSystem"
participant InventoryManagement as "Inventory Management\nSystem"
participant Database as "Database"
participant SupplierPortal as "Supplier\nPortal"

Cook -> MenuManagement : Check available products
MenuManagement -> InventoryManagement : Request current stock levels
InventoryManagement -> Database : Query inventory
Database --> InventoryManagement : Inventory data
InventoryManagement --> MenuManagement : Stock levels for products
MenuManagement -> Cook : Show available products
Cook -> MenuManagement : Create menu from available products
MenuManagement -> Database : Update menu items
Database --> MenuManagement : Confirm menu update
MenuManagement --> Cook : Menu updated confirmation

alt Low Stock Scenario
    InventoryManagement -> SupplierPortal : Trigger restocking order
    SupplierPortal -> Database : Log new supplier order
    Database --> SupplierPortal : Confirmation
    SupplierPortal --> InventoryManagement : Order confirmed
end

Cook -> InventoryManagement : Monitor stock after menu update
InventoryManagement -> Database : Query updated inventory
Database --> InventoryManagement : Updated inventory data
InventoryManagement --> Cook : Show updated stock levels

This sequence diagram starts with the cook checking available products to create a menu. The Menu Management System communicates with the Inventory Management System to fetch current stock levels from the database. Based on the stock levels, the cook decides to create a menu from the available products. After the cook updates the menu, the Menu Management System updates this information in the database, and the confirmation is sent back to the cook. There's also an "alternative" pathway shown where if the inventory management detects low stock on essential items, it triggers a restocking order with the supplier through the Supplier Portal, which then updates the database with the new order, and confirmation of this order is sent back to the inventory management system. Finally, the cook monitors the stock after the menu update to keep track of inventory levels, closing the loop.

This UML sequence diagram provides a schematic representation of the interactions necessary for a cook wanting to keep track of products available to create a menu, factoring in components like inventory checks and updates, potential supplier integration for restocking, and database interactions for real-time updates.

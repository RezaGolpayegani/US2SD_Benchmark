Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of deploying FABS (Federal Assistance Broker Submission or similar system) into production involves several key steps and stakeholders. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines the sequence diagram for this process. 

This diagram assumes a simplified process where an Agency user requests FABS deployment, which then goes through several validation and preparation steps by Development, DevOps, and QA teams before finally being deployed into production.

Please note that while this provides a structure, actual deployment processes may include more rigorous steps, including but not limited to security checks, compliance verification, and more detailed interactions between teams.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AgencyUser as AU
participant Developer as Dev
participant DevOps as DO
participant QA as QA

AU -> Dev: Request FABS Deployment
activate Dev

Dev -> Dev: Finalize FABS build
Dev -> DO: Handover to DevOps for deployment preparation
activate DO

DO -> DO: Prepare production environment
DO -> DO: Validate deployment scripts

DO -> QA: Request deployment validation
activate QA

QA -> QA: Validate FABS in pre-production
QA -> QA: Perform functional and performance tests
QA -> DO: Confirm validation success

DO -> DO: Deploy FABS to production
DO -> AU: Confirm FABS deployment

deactivate Dev
deactivate DO
deactivate QA

This sequence diagram starts with the Agency User requesting the FABS deployment and proceeds through the development, operations, and quality assurance phases, ending with the confirmation of the deployment to the Agency User. Each participant (Agency User, Developer, DevOps, QA) plays a critical role in this process, ensuring that the FABS system is ready and validated for production use.

In case your scenario or system involves additional layers of approval, security checks, or other steps, you might want to expand this diagram accordingly to include those stages for a more comprehensive overview.

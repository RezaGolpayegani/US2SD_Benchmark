Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story in Plant UML format involves illustrating the interactions between the Camp Administrator, the Camp Management & Communication Platform, and its subsystems involved in storing a camper's immediate parent or guardian's information.

This sequence would typically include the steps taken from the initiation by the camp administrator to input the guardian's information, through the processing by the system, to finally storing that information in the database.

Below is a basic Plant UML code snippet creating such a sequence diagram. This example simplifies complex processes and focuses on the user story's main interactions. Please note, to visualize this diagram, you would need to use a tool or a service that supports Plant UML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Camp Administrator" as admin
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Camper Management Module" as camperModule
database "Camp Database" as db

== Store Camper's Parent/Guardian Information ==

admin -> web : Navigate to "Add Guardian Info"
web -> camperModule : Request to add guardian info form
camperModule -> web : Return guardian info form
web -> admin : Display guardian info form

admin -> web : Submit camper's guardian information
web -> camperModule : Validate guardian information
alt Valid Information
  camperModule -> db : Store guardian information
  db -> camperModule : Confirm storage
  camperModule -> web : Confirm to admin
  web -> admin : Display confirmation message
else Invalid Information
  camperModule -> web : Inform about the error
  web -> admin : Display error message
end

This Plant UML diagram outlines the flow when a Camp Administrator wants to store a camperâ€™s immediate parent or guardian's information in the system:

1. **Camp Administrator** initiates the process by navigating to the relevant section on the platform's Web Interface to add a guardian's info.
2. The **Web Interface** requests the form from the **Camper Management Module**.
3. The **Camper Management Module** sends the form back to the interface, which is then shown to the administrator.
4. The administrator fills out and submits the guardian's information via the Web Interface.
5. This interface passes the data to the Camper Management Module for validation.
6. Assuming the information is valid, the Camper Management Module then stores this information in the **Camp Database**.
7. The database confirms the storage, and through the sequence, a confirmation message is shown back to the administrator.

If the information submitted is found to be invalid at any point, the error flow is activated, providing an error message to the administrator through the web interface.

Keep in view that this is a basic representation. Depending on your application's complexity, you might need to add more details or steps, such as error handling mechanisms, direct communication with APIs, or interaction with other modules of your platform.

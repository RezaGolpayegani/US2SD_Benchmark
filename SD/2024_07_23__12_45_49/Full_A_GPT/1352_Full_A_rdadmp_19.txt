Creating a sequence diagram for the given user story **"As an IT staff member, I want to know which kind of data types will be produced or collected, so that I can determine what basic support services and functionalities are required."** involves illustrating the flow of interaction between different entities within the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) framework, specifically focusing on the process by which an IT staff member identifies the data types involved in a project and assesses the required support services and functionalities.

**Note:** The sequence diagram below outlines the primary steps and interactions in the process. Given the limitations of text representation, the diagram is described in a PlantUML-compatible format, allowing you to create a visual representation using PlantUML tools.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ITStaff as "IT Staff"
participant ProjectPlan as "Project Plan"
participant DMPTool as "DMPTool"
participant MetadataTool as "Metadata Tool"
participant DataManager as "Data Manager"
participant ServicesDB as "Services Database"

== Determine Data Types and Required Support Services ==

ITStaff -> DMPTool: Access project details
activate DMPTool

DMPTool -> ProjectPlan: Request project metadata
activate ProjectPlan

ProjectPlan --> DMPTool: Return metadata (incl. data types)

DMPTool -> MetadataTool: Import metadata
activate MetadataTool

MetadataTool --> DMPTool: Metadata imported successfully

deactivate ProjectPlan
deactivate MetadataTool

DMPTool -> DataManager: Analyze metadata for data types
activate DataManager

DataManager --> DMPTool: List of data types
deactivate DataManager

DMPTool -> ITStaff: Display data types
activate ITStaff

ITStaff -> ServicesDB: Query for required services per data type
activate ServicesDB
Services首页531DB --> ITStaff: List of required services and functionalities
deactivate ServicesDB

deactivate DMPTool
deactivate ITStaff

**Explanation:**

1. **IT Staff starts the process** by accessing the project details through the DMPTool platform to understand the data types involved in the project.

2. **DMPTool requests project metadata** from the Project Plan, which includes detailed information about the data to be produced or collected.

3. **Project Plan responds** with the requested metadata including data types.

4. **Metadata importation**: Optionally, if external metadata tools are used, DMPTool may import this metadata for a comprehensive view.

5. **Data Manager's role** could involve analyzing the metadata, confirming, or detailing the types of data involved in the project, if such a step is part of the process.

6. **DMPTool presents the data types** to the IT Staff, enabling them to understand the types of data the project will handle.

7. **IT Staff queries the Services Database** to determine what basic support services and functionalities are required for the identified data types.

8. **Services Database returns the list of required services** and functionalities for each data type to IT Staff, completing the process.

This sequence offers a structured visualization of how the IT staff member would interact with the DMPTool and other components to identify the data types involved in a project and the required IT support services and functionalities.

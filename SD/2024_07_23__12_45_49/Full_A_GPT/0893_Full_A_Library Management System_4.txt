Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to create my borrows" in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the Customer, Frontend Interface, Backend Server, Database, and potentially other systems involved in the process of borrowing books. Below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax that captures the process of a customer creating a book borrowing request.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Customer -> Frontend: Selects book(s) to borrow
Frontend -> Backend: Requests to create borrow transaction(s)
activate Backend
Backend -> DB: Checks availability of book(s)
activate DB
DB --> Backend: Returns availability status
deactivate DB

alt If book(s) available
    Backend -> DB: Create borrow record(s) with due date
    activate DB
    DB --> Backend: Confirm borrow record(s) creation
    deactivate DB
    
    Backend -> DB: Update book(s) status to borrowed
    activate DB
    DB --> Backend: Confirm book(s) status updated
    deactivate DB
    
    Backend --> Frontend: Borrow transaction success
    Frontend -> Customer: Display success message & borrow details
else If book(s) not available
    Backend --> Frontend: Borrow transaction failed - Book(s) not available
    Frontend -> Customer: Display error message
end

This diagram illustrates the crucial steps when a customer attempts to borrow books using the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS):

1. **Selecting Books:** The customer starts the process by selecting one or more books they wish to borrow through the frontend interface.
2. **Borrow Request:** The frontend interface communicates this request to the backend server to initiate the borrowing process.
3. **Availability Check:** The backend server checks the book(s)' availability in the library's database.
4. **Transaction Record:** If the books are available, the backend server creates borrow records in the database, including setting the due dates for the return of the books. It then updates the book status to 'borrowed'.
5. **Success or Failure Response:** The backend server sends a response back to the frontend interface indicating whether the borrow transaction was successful or not.
6. **Notification to Customer:** Finally, the customer is notified through the frontend interface with either a success message and borrow details or an error message if the book(s) are not available.

Remember, this is a simplified representation and can be elaborated based on the actual complexities, such as handling multiple books, checking user borrowing limits, and integrating with payment gateways for handling fines for previous late returns, before allowing new borrows.

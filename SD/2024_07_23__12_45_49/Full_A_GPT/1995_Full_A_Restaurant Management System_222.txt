The following is a possible sequence diagram in PlantUML format depicting the user story: "As a manager, I want to view reports on customer orders so that I can pinpoint recurring orders."

This scenario imagines a simplified process where the manager uses the Restaurant Management and Operations System to request and view reports on customer orders, with the objective of identifying trends or recurring orders.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Manager
participant "Management \nInterface" as ManagementInterface
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> ManagementInterface : Request report on customer orders
activate ManagementInterface

ManagementInsertface -> Server: GET /reports/customerOrders
activate Server

Server -> DB : Query Customer Orders
activate DB

DB --> Server : Return Order Data
deactivate DB

Server --> ManagementInterface : Report Data with recurring orders
deactivate Server

ManagementInterface --> Manager : Display Report with Trends
deactivate ManagementInterface

```

Explanation of each step:

1. **Manager requests a report**: The Manager interacts with the Management Interface to request a report focusing on customer orders. This request aims to look for patterns or recurring orders among customers.

2. **Management Interface requests data**: The Management Interface sends a request to the Backend Server for information concerning customer orders. This is typically a REST API call using a method like GET and specifying the endpoint (in this example, "/reports/customerOrders").

3. **Server queries the Database**: The Backend Server processes this request and, in turn, queries the Database to retrieve the relevant customer order data.

4. **Database returns order data**: The Database processes the query and returns the data concerning all customer orders to the Backend Server.

5. **Server processes and sends report data**: The Backend Server processes the raw data to identify any trends or recurring orders and then sends this informa

To model this scenario as a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, it is essential to map out the key interactions between the system components involved in presenting accompaniment suggestions to an employee based on users' selection to promote upselling. 

The sequence diagram will include the following entities:

- **User** (_the diner making a selection_)
- **EmployeeInterface** (_where the employee interacts with the system_)
- **OrderManagementSystem** (_handling the logic for receiving and processing orders_)
- **MenuManagementSystem** (_responsible for managing the menu, including suggestions_)
- **Database** (_stores data related to menu items, suggestions, etc._)

Below is a PlantUML code that represents the interaction between these entities to fulfill the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant EmployeeInterface 
participant OrderManagementSystem
participant MenuManagementSystem
participant Database

User -> EmployeeInterface : Selects dish
EmployeeInterface -> OrderManagementSystem : Capture dish selection
OrderManagementSystem -> MenuManagementSystem : Request accompaniment suggestions
MenuManagementSystem -> Database : Query accompaniments based on selection
Database -> MenuManagementSystem : Return suggestions
MenuManagementSystem -> OrderManagementSystem : Send accompaniment suggestions
OrderManagementSystem -> EmployeeInterface : Display suggestions
EmployeeInterface -> User : Show suggestions for upselling

@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. **User selects a dish**: The interaction begins with the diner making a selection which is captured by the employee through the EmployeeInterface.
2. **Capture dish selection**: The EmployeeInterface communicates with the OrderManagementSystem to log the user's dish selection.
3. **Request accompaniment suggestions**: The OrderManagementSystem asks the MenuManagementSystem for accompaniment suggestions that complement the selected dish.
4. **Query accompaniments based on selection**: The MenuManagementSystem queries the Database for suggestions based on the initial selection.
5. **Return suggestions**: The Database returns a list of potential accompaniments to the MenuManagementSystem.
6. **Send accompaniment suggestions**: These suggestions are then communicated back to the OrderManagementSystem, which in turn sends them to the EmployeeInterface.
7. **Display suggestions**: Finally, the EmployeeInterface displays these suggestions to the employee, who can then promote these upselling opportunities to the user.

This sequence diagram outlines the interaction flow for generating an accompaniment suggestion feature, aimed at facilitating upselling by employees in a restaurant management and operations system.

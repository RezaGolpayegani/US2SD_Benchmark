Below is an example of a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the specified user story: "As a site visitor, I want to access old news that is no automated answers on the home page, so that I can access things I remember from the have passed or that others mention to me."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteVisitor as visitor
participant "Search Functionality" as search
participant "Database" as db
participant "News Content Management System" as cms
participant "News Archive Page" as archive

visitor -> search : Enter search query for old news
search -> db : Query database for matching news entries
db -> search : Return list of matching news entries
search -> cms : Request detailed news items based on search results
db -> cms : Retrieve full news items
cms -> archive : Generate news archive page with search results
archive -> visitor : Display news archive page including old news items
@enduml
```

The sequence starts with the site visitor entering a search query for old news that is no longer visible on the home page. The search functionality takes this input and queries the database for matching news entries based on the visitor's input. The database returns a list of matching entries to the search functionality, which then requests the detailed news items from the News Content Management System (CMS). The CMS retrieves the full details of the news items from the database and generates a news archive page containing these items. The archive page, which includes the old news items the visitor was looking for, is displayed back to the site visitor.

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the interactions between a site visitor, the search functionality, database, content management system, and the news archive page subsystem in facilitating access to old news articles that are not displayed on the home page.

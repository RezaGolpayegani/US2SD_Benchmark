Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story in PlantUML format will involve several actors and components interacting with the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool). Weâ€™ll illustrate how an IT staff member can interact with the tool to understand data usage and therefore determine the necessary IT services and functionalities. The process involves checking data usage reports and analytics through the DMPTool.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ITStaff as "IT Staff Member"
participant DMPToolUI as "DMPTool Interface"
database DataUsageDB as "Data Usage Database"
participant AnalysisModule as "Analysis & Reporting Module"

== Requesting Data Usage Information ==
ITStaff -> DMPToolUI : Request access to data usage reports
DMPToolUI -> AnalysisModule : Retrieve data usage details
AnalysisModule -> DataUsageDB : Query usage analytics and reports
DataUsageDB --> AnalysisModule : Return analytics data
AnalysisModule --> DMPToolUI : Display formatted reports
DMPToolUI --> ITStaff : Present data usage reports

== Analyzing Data Usage for IT Service Planning ==
ITStaff -> DMPToolUI : Analyze data reports
Note right of ITStaff : ITStaff determines\nrequired IT services and\nfunctionalities based on\nusage patterns and volume.

In this sequence diagram:

1. **IT Staff Member**: This is you, the person who wants to understand how data is used across the system, to plan the necessary IT resources and services.
2. **DMPTool Interface**: The graphical user interface of the DMPTool where users interact with the system.
3. **Analysis & Reporting Module**: A backend component of DMPTool that processes data usage analytics and generates reports.
4. **Data Usage Database**: The database that stores logs and analytics of how data has been accessed and used by different entities.

### Steps Illustrated in the Diagram:

- The IT staff member initiates the process by requesting access to data usage reports through the DMPTool interface.
- The DMPTool interface forwards this request to the Analysis & Reporting Module, which is responsible for retrieving and processing the requested information.
- The Analysis & Reporting Module queries the Data Usage Database to fetch the necessary analytics and report data on how the data has been used, focusing on aspects relevant to IT planning (e.g., volume, frequency, and type of data access).
- The Data Usage Database returns the requested analytics and information back to the Analysis & Reporting Module.
- The Analysis & Reporting Module formats this data into comprehensive reports and sends them to the DMPTool interface.
- The DMPTool interface then presents these data usage reports to the IT staff member.
- The IT staff member analyzes these reports to understand the usage patterns, volumes, and types of data interactions, which are critical for determining the kind of basic services and functionalities required for effective IT support and resource planning.

This sequence diagram simplifies the workflow and interaction with the system to focus on the aspects most relevant to the IT staff member's needs within the context of this user story.

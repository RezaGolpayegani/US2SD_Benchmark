To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an administrator, I want to create blog posts, so that I can share the latest information about BADCamp with the public" using PlantUML, follow this example:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
database "Blog Database" as db
participant "Content Management \nSystem (CMS)" as cms

== Blog Creation Process ==
admin -> dashboard: Access Dashboard
dashboard -> cms: Select "Create Blog Post"
activate cms
admin -> cms: Provide Blog Post Content
note right of admin: Content includes title, \nbody, images, and tags.
cms -> cms: Verify Content and Permissions
alt Validation Success
  cms -> db: Save New Blog Post
  db --> cms: Confirm Save
  cms --> admin: Display Success Message
else Validation Failure
  cms --> admin: Show Error Messages
end
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Diagram Elements:

1. **Administrator (admin)**: This is the actor in our diagram, representing the administrator who wants to create and share a blog post.
2. **Admin Dashboard (dashboard)**: A user interface where the administrator starts the task. It represents an entry point for admin tasks.
3. **Content Management System (CMS)**: The system through which the administrator creates and manages blog posts.
4. **Blog Database (db)**: This is where the blog post data is stored after creation.

Sequence of Actions:

1. **Access Dashboard**: The administrator accesses the Admin Dashboard.
2. **Select "Create Blog Post"**: From the dashboard, the selection to create a new blog post is made, transitioning to the CMS interface.
3. **Provide Blog Post Content**: The administrator enters all relevant content for the blog post, including the title, body, images, and tags.
4. **Verify Content and Permissions**: Before saving, the CMS checks the content for completeness and ensures the administrator has the permissions to post.
5. **Save New Blog Post / Show Error Messages**: Depending on whether content validation is successful, the system either saves the new blog post to the Blog Database or shows error messages to the administrator. If saved successfully, a confirmation is sent back to the CMS, and subsequently, a success message is displayed to the administrator.

This simplified sequence diagram represents the basic steps an administrator would go through to create and publish a blog post about BADCamp, assuming the web platform is backed by a typical Content Management System and database setup.

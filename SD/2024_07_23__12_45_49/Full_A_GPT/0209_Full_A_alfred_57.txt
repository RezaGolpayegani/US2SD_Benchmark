Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an Older Person, I want to use ALFRED to send messages" involves illustrating the interactions between the user (Older Person), ALFRED (the system), potentially a backend server, and a recipient. Since sequence diagrams in PlantUML focus on the exchange of messages and the sequence of these interactions, the following example captures the flow from the user initiating a voice command to send a message, through the system processing this request, to the eventual delivery of the message to the recipient. 

This PlantUML code does not account for the initialization of the system or error handling to keep the example clear and focused on the core functionality.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED (Voice Recognition)" as alfredVoice
participant "ALFRED (System Core)" as alfredCore
participant "Messaging Service" as messagingService
participant Recipient as recipient

user -> alfredVoice : Says "Send a message to [Recipient Name]"
activate alfredVoice
alfredVoice -> alfredCore : Translates voice to text\n"Send a message to [Recipient Name]"
activate alfredCore
alfredCore -> alfredCore : Identifies Recipient\nand prepares message prompt
alfredCore -> alfredVoice : Requests message content
deactivate alfredCore
activate alfredVoice
alfredVoice -> user : Asks for the message content
deactivate alfredVoice
user -> alfredVoice : Provides the message content via voice
activate alfredVoice
alfredVoice -> alfredCore : Translates message content from voice to text
activate alfredCore
deactivate alfredVoice
alfredCore -> messagingService : Sends message content\nand Recipient details
activate messagingService
messagingService -> recipient : Delivers the message
deactivate messagingService
recipient -> messagingService : Acknowledges receipt
messagingService -> alfredCore : Confirms delivery
deactivate alfredCore
alfredCore -> alfredVoice : Informs success to user
activate alfredVoice
alfredVoice -> user : Confirms message sent
deactivate alfredVoice

This sequence diagram starts with the Older Person initiating a command to send a message by speaking to the ALFRED device. ALFRED's voice recognition component interprets the command and passes it to the core system, which processes the request, including looking up the recipient and asking for the message content. The process continues as the Older Person dictates the message, which is then transmitted to the messaging service and delivered to the recipient. The sequence concludes with a confirmation of message delivery being relayed back to the Older Person.

This diagram assumes a streamlined process where voice commands are accurately recognized and translated, interactions with external services (like a messaging platform) are successful, and the recipient's system can acknowledge the receipt of the message. In a comprehensive system like ALFRED, additional steps for error handling, privacy checks, and user authentication could also be included to provide a more detailed representation.

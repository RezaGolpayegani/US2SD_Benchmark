Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to edit employees' shift information" involves depicting the interactions between various components and actors in the system. Given the technology stack mentioned in the project description (React.js or Angular for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, etc.), we'll highlight a typical flow for this action.

While a textual representation in PlantUML can't be visually rendered here, I'll provide you with the PlantUML code that you could use in a PlantUML editor or tool to generate the sequence diagram. This code will outline the sequence of operations initiated by a manager wanting to edit an employee's shift information through the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
participant "Manager Interface" as manager
participant "Backend Server\n(Node.js + Express)" as backend
database "Database\n(PostgreSQL or MongoDB)" as db
participant "Employee Interface" as employee

== Editing an Employee's Shift Information ==

manager -> backend : Request: Edit Shift Interface
activate backend
backend -> db : Fetch Employee's Current Shift Data
activate db
db --> backend : Return Current Shift Data
deactivate db
backend --> manager : Show Current Shift Data
deactivate backend
manager -> backend : Submit Updated Shift Data (Employee ID, New Shift Details)
activate backend
backend -> db : Update Shift Information
activate db
db --> backend : Confirmation
deactivate db
backend --> manager : Update Confirmation
deactivate backend

== Notification of Shift Change ==
backend -> employee : Notify Shift Change
activate employee
employee --> backend : Acknowledge Receipt
deactivate employee

### Explanation:
- The sequence starts with the "Manager Interface" initiating a request to edit shift information; this is typically done through a GUI where the manager selects an employee whose shift details need modification.
- The "Backend Server" processes this request. It first fetches the current shift data for the specified employee from the "Database".
- The Database returns the current shift data to the Backend Server.
- The Backend Server then sends this data to the Manager Interface, where the manager can view and decide what changes to make.
- Once the manager submits the updated shift information, the process repeats: the Backend Server updates this data in the Database.
- After the Database confirms the update, the Backend Server sends an update confirmation to the Manager Interface, closing the manager's loop.
- Additionally, there's a notification sent to the "Employee Interface" (to inform the employee of their new shift details), which completes the sequence by the employee acknowledging the receipt of this notification.

This PlantUML code captures the basic flow of editing an employee's shift information from the perspective of a manager using the Restaurant Management and Operations System. To visualize this sequence, you'll need to use a PlantUML editor or a compatible tool that can interpret and render PlantUML syntax.

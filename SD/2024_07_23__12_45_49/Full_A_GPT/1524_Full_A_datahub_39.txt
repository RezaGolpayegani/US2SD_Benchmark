To visualize the user story of a Developer wanting to list all DataPackages requirements for a project and pin the exact versions to ensure deterministic local deployment, we create a sequence diagram. This diagram illustrates the interactions between the Developer, the Data Registry and Publishing Platform, and the underlying systems involved in managing DataPackages and their versions.

Please note that PlantUML code provides a high-level abstract representation and needs to be tailored to specific implementations. The following is a generic sequence diagram tailored to the provided User Story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant "CLI Tool" as CLI
participant "Platform API" as API
participant "Database" as DB
participant "File System" as FS

Developer -> CLI: Executes command with\nrequirements file
CLI -> API: Requests DataPackages information\nbased on file
API -> DB: Queries available DataPackages\nand versions
DB -> API: Returns DataPackages data
API -> CLI: Provides list of DataPackages\nand current versions
CLI -> Developer: Displays available DataPackages\nand versions
Developer -> CLI: Pins exact versions\nin the file
CLI -> FS: Updates the file with pinned versions
FS -> CLI: Confirms file update
CLI -> Developer: Notifies of successful pinning

@enduml
```

This sequence begins with the Developer executing a command through the CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, specifying their project's DataPackage requirements. The CLI then communicates with the Platform's API to fetch details of the available DataPackages and their versions. This information is provided back to the Developer, allowing them to review it. Subsequently, the Developer decides to pin exact versions of DataPackages to avoid any schema changes affecting the project. The CLI updates the requirements file on the local file system with these version pins and confirms the successful update to the Developer.

It is important to recognize the simplification in this diagram; real-world implementations might involve additional steps, such as authentication processes, data validation, and more detailed error handling mechanisms.

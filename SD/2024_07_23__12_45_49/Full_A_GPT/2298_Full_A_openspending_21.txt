Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves outlining the complex interactions between the user, system components, and external services. The user story focuses on the ability of a data consuming user to share an image of a particular view state to social networks. The sequence diagram must capture the process from initiating the share request to posting on social networks. Below is a PlantUML code example representing these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Visualization Interface" as Vis
participant "Image Capture Service" as ImgCap
participant "Social Media Integration Module" as SM
participant "Social Network API" as SN

User -> Vis: Request shareable image of view state
Vis -> ImgCap: Trigger image capture of current view
ImgCap -> ImgCap: Capture and process view state
ImgCap -> Vis: Return image URL
Vis -> User: Display image preview and share options

User -> Vis: Select "Share to Social Network"
Vis -> SM: Initiate share request with image URL
SM -> SN: Invoke Social Network API\nwith image URL
SN -> SN: Authenticate request
SN -> SN: Post image with context
SN --> SM: Return sharing status
SM --> Vis: Notify user of share success
Vis --> User: Display confirmation message

```

This code snippet outlines the interaction process:

1. The **User** requests a shareable image of the current view state from the **Visualization Interface**.
2. The **Visualization Interface** triggers the **Image Capture Service** to capture the current view.
3. The **Image Capture Service** processes the view state and returns an image URL to the **Visualization Interface**.
4. The **Visualization Interface** displays an image preview along with share options to the **User**.
5. Upon the user's decision to share to a social network, the **Visualization Interface** communicates with the **Social Media Integration Module**, passing the image URL.
6. The **Social Media Integration Module** invokes the appropriate **Social Network API**, providing the image URL and any necessary context for sharing.
7. The **Social Network API** processes the request, authenticates it, and posts the image with the context provided.
8. Lastly, the **Social Media Integration Module** receives the sharing status from the **Social Network**, notifies the **Visualization Interface** of the success, and the user is then shown a confirmation message.

This sequence diagram represents a streamlined process allowing a data-consuming user to share an image of a view state on social networks, enhancing communication and data sharing capabilities on platforms designed for data consumption and visualization.

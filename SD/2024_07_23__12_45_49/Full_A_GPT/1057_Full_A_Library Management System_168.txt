Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story—"As a library member, I want to perform operations under 20 seconds"—requires mapping out the interactions between various components within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) for a typical operation, such as searching for a book. This example assumes the library member is using the CLMS's web interface and focuses on the sequence of actions following the user's request to search for a book.

Please note, sequence diagrams are a textual representation of how objects and components in a system interact to accomplish a specific task, and PlantUML is a tool that can turn this textual representation into a visual diagram. Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram script covering a basic flow where a library member performs a search operation on the CLMS:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant FrontEndServer as FES
participant ApplicationLogic as AL
participant Database as DB

UI -> FES : Enter search criteria
activate FES
FES -> AL : Forward search criteria
activate AL
AL -> DB : Query for books based on criteria
activate DB
DB --> AL : Return search results
deactivate DB
AL --> FES : Processed results
deactivate AL
FES --> UI : Display search results
deactivate FES

@enduml
```

Explanation of the flow:

1. **UserInterface (UI):** Represents the CLMS's frontend web interface through which the library member interacts.

2. **FrontEndServer (FES):** Acts as the middleman that receives requests from the UI and passes them to the application logic. It processes the incoming data from the user interface, possibly handling preliminary data validation or authentication checks.

3. **ApplicationLogic (AL):** Embodies the core functionality of the CLMS, including the search algorithms and business logic. It receives the search criteria from the FrontEndServer, processes this information, and forms a database query.

4. **Database (DB):** Represents the backend storage system of CLMS, which stores all data on books, members, and transactions. It is queried by the ApplicationLogic layer and returns the results back to it.

Each interaction is designed to be as quick and efficient as possible to ensure the library member can perform their desired operations—such as searching for a book—within 20 seconds. This requires optimized database queries, efficient processing in the application logic, and rapid response delivery to the user interface.

While this sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of a search operation, specific implementations may introduce additional layers or services (e.g., caching services, external APIs for book information) that could complicate the sequence but are essential for improving performance and user experience.

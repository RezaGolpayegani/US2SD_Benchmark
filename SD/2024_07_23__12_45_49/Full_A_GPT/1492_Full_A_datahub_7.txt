Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting the interaction between various components of the system when a Publisher imports a data package into the registry. Below is a PlantUML script that represents these interactions, from the moment the Publisher decides to import the data package to successfully publishing it on the platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme amiga

participant "Publisher" as Publisher
participant "Web UI" as WebUI
participant "API Gateway" as APIGateway
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
participant "Data Validation Service" as ValidationService
participant "Data Storage" as DataStorage
participant "Registry Database" as RegistryDB
participant "CLI Tool" as CLITool

== Authentication ==
Publisher -> WebUI : Select "Import Data Package"
WebUI -> APIGateway : Request to import data package
APIGateway -> AuthService : Validates Publisher's credentials
AuthService --> APIGateway : Authentication success

== Data Package Import Flow ==
Publisher -> CLITool : Executes import command with package details
CLITool -> APIGateway : Sends data package information
APIGateway -> ValidationService : Validates data package format and integrity
ValidationBootstrapService -> DataStorage : Temporarily stores data for validation
ValidationService --> APIGateway : Returns validation success or failure
APIGateway --> CLITool : Shows validation status
group Validation Success
    CLITool -> APIGateway : Requests to finalize import
    APIGateway -> RegistryDB : Records data package entry
    APIGateway -> DataStorage : Moves data to permanent storage
    DataStorage --> APIGateway : Confirms data storage
    APIGateway --> CLITool : Confirms data package is successfully imported and available online
    CLITool --> Publisher : Displays confirmation message
end

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Authentication:** 
   - The Publisher starts the process by selecting the option to import a data package through the Web UI.
   - The Web UI sends a request to the API Gateway to initiate the import process.
   - The API Gateway forwards the request to the Authentication Service to verify the Publisher's credentials.
   - Upon successful authentication, the process continues.

2. **Data Package Import Flow:**
   - The Publisher uses the CLI Tool to execute the import command, including the data package details.
   - The CLI Tool sends the data package information to the API Gateway.
   - The API Gateway then instructs the Data Validation Service to validate the format and integrity of the data package.
   - The Data Validation Service temporarily stores the data in Data Storage for validation purposes.
   - Post-validation, the API Gateway receives a success or failure response.
   - On validation success, the CLI tool requests the API Gateway to finalize the import.
   - The API Gateway updates the Registry Database with the new data package entry and moves the data to permanent storage.
   - Once the data is confirmed to be stored, the API Gateway sends a success message to the CLI Tool, which then informs the Publisher.

This sequence diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions and flow of information between the Publisher, CLI Tool, Web UI, and backend services when importing a data package into the data registry.

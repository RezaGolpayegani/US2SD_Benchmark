To create a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story in PlantUML, we need to illustrate the interactions between the library member and various components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) such as the user interface, server-side application logic, and the database management system. The process starts with the user initiating a search and ends with displaying the shelf number of the related books.

Here is a simplified example of how you might structure this in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Member as member
participant "UI: Library Portal" as ui
control "Server: Application Logic" as server
database "DB: Library Database" as db

== Search for Related Books Using Unique Info ==
member -> ui : Enter search criteria\n(title, author, subject, etc.)
ui -> server : Request books by criteria
server -> db : Query for books matching criteria
db -> server : Return matching books data
server -> db : Query for shelf numbers of matching books
db -> server : Return shelf numbers
server -> ui : Display books and shelf numbers
ui -> member : Show matching books and their locations

This diagram focuses on the main steps involved in the process from a high-level perspective:

1. **Member interaction**: The library member starts by entering search criteria (such as title, author, or subject) into the library portal's user interface (UI).

2. **Request forwarding**: The UI sends this request to the server's application logic, which is responsible for handling such queries.

3. **Database query**: The server then queries the library database (DB) for books that match the given criteria.

4. **Data retrieval**: The database returns the data of the matching books to the server.

5. **Shelf number query**: To find the shelf number where each book is located, the server sends another query to the database.

6. **Shelf information retrieval**: The database returns the shelf numbers for the matching books.

7. **Display results**: Finally, the server sends the data (including book details and shelf numbers) back to the UI, which displays it to the member.

This sequence diagram exemplifies how a library member's request to find related books by unique information is processed through the Comprehensive Library Management System, detailing each of the interactions across the system's components.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the integration of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform with a Current Research Information System (CRIS) as desired by a Research Information Manager entails outlining the steps involved in this process from both the system's and the user's perspectives. Here's a representation in PlantUML format that encapsulates the user story mentioned:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Research Information Manager" as manager
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Integration Module" as integration
database "Research Data Platform" as RDP
database "CRIS" as CRIS

manager -> UI : Initiate Integration Request
UI -> integration : Request CRIS Integration
activate integration

integration -> RDP : Fetch Data
activate RDP
RDP -> integration : Return Data
deactivate RDP

integration -> CRIS : Send Data for Analysis
activate CRIS
CRIS -> integration : Acknowledge & Process Data
deactivate CRIS

integration -> UI : Confirm Integration & Analysis Status
UI -> manager : Display Confirmation & Link to Analyzed Data

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Research Information Manager initiating an integration request from the platform's user interface. The integration module then proceeds to request and fetch relevant data from the Research Data Platform. Once the data is obtained, it's sent to the CRIS for analysis. After processing the data, CRIS acknowledges the receipt and processing of the data back to the integration module, which then confirms the successful integration and analysis status to the Research Information Manager through the user interface.

This workflow ensures that the Research Information Manager has the mechanisms to link funding to all outputs produced by research data publication, aiming at analyzing the impact of research data publication effectively.

Given the project description and the specific user story, let's outline how we might convert this into a detailed sequence diagram using PlantUML language. The sequence diagram will outline the interactions between the depositor, the platform, and other components necessary to grant privileged access to collaborators.

Considering the user story, "As a depositor, I want to allow my collaborators privileged access to datasets, so that we continue to have a productive relationship," we'll involve the following actors/systems in the sequence diagram:

1. **Depositor**: The primary user who wants to grant access.
2. **Enhanced Research Data Management Platform (Platform)**: Where datasets are managed.
3. **Access Management System (AMS)**: Manages access levels and permissions.
4. **Collaborator**: The beneficiary of the privileged access.

Here's the sequence of events to address the user story, translated into PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Platform" as Platform
participant "Access Management System\n(AMS)" as AMS
actor Collaborator

Depositor -> Platform: Access data management area
Platform -> Depositor: Display data management options
Depositor -> Platform: Select "Manage Collaborators" option
Platform -> AMS: Request current access levels
AMS -> Platform: Return access levels
Platform -> Depositor: Display collaborators and access levels
Depositor -> Platform: Select "Grant Access" for specific collaborator
Platform -> AMS: Update access for Collaborator
AMS -> Platform: Confirm access update
Platform -> Depositor: Display success message
Depositor -> Collaborator: Inform about access grant\n(optionally via Platform)
@enduml
```

This PlantUML script outlines a typical interaction where the depositor navigates the platform to manage collaborators' access, interacting via a simplified interface with the Access Management System (AMS) to update and confirm the permissions for a specific collaborator. Optionally, there's an implied step where the depositor might inform the collaborator about their newly granted access, which could also be facilitated by an automatic notification from the platform itself, although this detail is beyond the specific interactions outlined in the original user story.

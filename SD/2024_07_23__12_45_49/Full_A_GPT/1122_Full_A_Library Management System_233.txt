To represent the process of a library member placing a reservation for books that are currently unavailable as a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, you need to include several actors and systems that interact throughout the process. Below is an example of how you could structure this sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Search System" as Search
participant "Reservation System" as Reserve
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Notification System" as Notify

Member -> Search : search(bookDetails)
Search -> DB : query(bookAvailability)
DB --> Search : bookUnavailable
Search --> Member : displayUnavailableBookInfo

Member -> Reserve : requestReservation(bookID)
Reserve -> DB : checkBookStatus(bookID)
alt Book is available
  DB --> Reserve : bookAvailable
  Reserve --> Member : informBookAvailable\nUnable to Reserve
else Book is unavailable
  DB --> Reserve : bookUnavailable
  Reserve -> DB : addReservation(bookID, memberID)
  DB --> Reserve : reservationConfirmed
  Reserve --> Member : reservationSuccess(bookID)
  Reserve -> Notify : scheduleReservationNotification(bookID, memberID)
  DB -> Notify : setNotificationDetails(notificationInfo)
  Notify --> Reserve : notificationScheduled
end

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Member initiates a search**: The sequence starts with the library member searching for a book by title, author, subject category, etc., using the search system.

2. **Search System queries the Database**: The search system queries the database to check the availability of the requested book.

3. **Database responds with book availability**: The database indicates that the book is currently unavailable.

4. **Search System informs the Member**: The unavailable book information is displayed to the member, including an option to place a reservation.

5. **Member requests to reserve the book**: The member decides to reserve the book and places a reservation request through the reservation system.

6. **Reservation System checks book status**: The reservation system checks the current status of the book in the database.

7. **Database responds with availability**: The database responds. If the book is unexpectedly available, the member is informed they can't reserve but borrow it now. If itâ€™s still unavailable, the process continues.

8. **Reservation System adds a reservation**: The reservation system confirms the book's unavailability and adds a reservation in the database for the member.

9. **Database confirms the reservation**: After successfully adding the reservation, the database sends a confirmation to the reservation system.

10. **Member is informed of the successful reservation**: The reservation system informs the member that the reservation is successful.

11. **Notification System schedules a notification**: The reservation system schedules a notification for when the book becomes available, involving interaction with the notification system and the database to set up and confirm notification details.

The above sequence diagram illustrates how different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) interact to allow a library member to place a reservation for books currently unavailable, including the handling of book status checks, reservation requests, database updating, and notification scheduling.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story where a library manager updates the shelf number of a book involves several actors and systems interfacing with each other. Below is a sequence diagram described in PlantUML format that illustrates this process.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant LibraryManager as LM
participant LibraryManagementSystem as LMS
participant Database as DB

LM -> LMS: Login()
activate LMS
LMS -> DB: ValidateCredentials()
activate DB
DB --> LMS: CredentialsValid()
deactivate DB

LMS --> LM: DisplayDashboard()
deactivate LMS
LM -> LMS: SelectBookToUpdateShelfNo(bookId)
activate LMS

LMS -> DB: GetBookDetails(bookId)
activate DB
DB --> LMS: ReturnBookDetails()
deactivate DB

LMS --> LM: DisplayBookDetails()
LM -> LMS: EnterNewShelfNo(shelfNo)
LMS -> DB: UpdateShelfNumber(bookId, shelfNo)
activate DB
DB --> LMS: ShelfNumberUpdated()
deactivate DB

LMS --> LM: DisplayUpdateConfirmation()
deactivate LMS

This sequence diagram begins with the library manager logging into the Library Management System. Upon successful login, they navigate to update a book's shelf number. The system first retrieves and displays the book's current details. The library manager then enters the new shelf number, and the system updates this information in the database and confirms the update to the library manager.

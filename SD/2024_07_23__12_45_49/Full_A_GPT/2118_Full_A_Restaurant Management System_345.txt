To illustrate the sequence of actions for an employee to mark their entry time in the Restaurant Management and Operations System, we can use a PlantUML code snippet. This diagram will demonstrate the process flow starting from the employee's interaction with the system to the updating of their entry time in the database. Please note that to generate the visualization of this diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML environment or compatible software.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Employee as E
participant "Employee Interface" as EI
participant "Server" as S
participant "Database" as DB

note over E: Employee decides to mark entry time
E -> EI: Accesses System
activate EI

EI -> S: Request to mark entry time
activate S

note over S: Validates employee authentication
S -> DB: Retrieve employee record
activate DB

DB --> S: Employee record
deactivate DB

S -> DB: Update entry time
DB --> S: Confirmation message
deactivate S

S --> EI: Display confirmation
EI --> E: Shows success message
deactivate EI

note over E: Entry time marked successfully

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
- **Employee (E)**: Initiates the process by deciding to mark their entry time.
- **Employee Interface (EI)**: Acts as the medium through which the employee interacts with the system.
- **Server (S)**: Handles the request by validating the employee's authentication, interacts with the database to retrieve and update the employee's record.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores all employee records, including their entry times. It is where the entry time is updated following the server's request.

### Steps Summarized:
1. The employee decides to mark their entry time and accesses the system via the Employee Interface.
2. The Employee Interface forwards the request to the server to mark the entry time.
3. The server validates the employee's authentication and requests the employee's record from the database.
4. Once the employee record is retrieved, the server updates the employee's record in the database with the new entry time.
5. The database confirms the successful update to the server.
6. The server then communicates this success back to the Employee Interface.
7. Finally, the Employee Interface displays a success message to the employee, indicating that their entry time has been successfully marked.

This sequence diagram assumes a simple process flow for an employee marking their entry time, highlighting interactions between the user, the system's interface, the server, and the database. The actual implementation could include additional steps for authentication, error handling, or logging.

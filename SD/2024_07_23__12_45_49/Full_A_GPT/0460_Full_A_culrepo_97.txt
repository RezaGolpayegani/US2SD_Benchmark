To illustrate the sequence of interactions for a repository support team member who wants to rename a collection in the digital repository system for Cornell University, we will use PlantUML syntax to create a sequence diagram. 

Given the complexity of such a system, the diagram will simplify the process while capturing the key interactions. We'll assume the digital repository has a web front-end that interacts with a back-end server, which in turn communicates with a database that stores the information about the collections.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant AuthenticationServer as Auth
participant ApplicationServer as AppSrv
participant Database as DB

UI -> Auth: Authenticate Request
Auth --> UI: Authentication Success

UI -> AppSrv: Rename Collection Request(collectionID, newName)
alt Collection Found and Permission Granted
    AppSrv -> DB: Check Collection by collectionID
    DB --> AppSrv: Collection Data
    AppSrv -> DB: Update Collection Name(newName)
    DB --> AppSrv: Update Success
    AppSrv --> UI: Rename Successful
else Collection Not Found or Permission Denied
    AppSrv --> UI: Error Message
end

```

This diagram walks through the following steps:

1. **Authentication:** The user interface sends an authentication request to determine if the repository support team member is logged in and has the necessary permissions to rename a collection.
2. **Request to Rename Collection:** Once authenticated, the user initiates a request to rename a collection by specifying the collection's ID and the new name.
3. **Check Collection and Permissions:** The Application Server checks if the collection exists in the database and if the user has the necessary permissions.
4. **Collection Found and Permission Granted Path:**
    - If the collection is found and permissions are verified, the Application Server updates the collection name in the database.
    - A success confirmation is sent back to the user interface.
5. **Collection Not Found or Permission Denied Path:**
    - If the collection does not exist or the user lacks the necessary permissions, an error message is sent back to the user interface.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the process for renaming a collection within the proposed digital repository system for Cornell University. The actual implementation details may vary based on the system's infrastructure, the database schema, and specific permission mechanisms employed.

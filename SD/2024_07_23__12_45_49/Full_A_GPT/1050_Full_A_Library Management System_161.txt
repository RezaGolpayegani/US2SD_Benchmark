Below is the PlantUML code to create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story: "As a library member, I want to look up books listed by publication date so that I can find the book I am looking for easier." This diagram assumes a basic interaction flow between the library member (user), a web frontend, the backend server, and the database system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember as Member
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Backend Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Member -> Web : Search for books by publication date
Web -> Server : Request: Search books\n[Publication date]
Server -> DB : Query books by publication date
DB -> Server : Return list of books
Server -> Web : Response: List of books\n[Sorted by publication date]
Web -> Member : Display books\n[Sorted by publication date]

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Library Member Initiates Search**: The library member (user) initiates the process by searching for books filtered by the publication date through the web interface. This step represents the user's action of entering their search criteria.

2. **Web Interface Processes Request**: The web interface receives the user's request and forwards it to the backend server. This step translates the user's input into a request that the server can process.

3. **Backend Server Handles Logic**: Upon receiving the request from the web interface, the backend server processes this request. It involves interpreting the search parameters (in this case, filtering by publication date).

4. **Database Query Execution**: The server then communicates with the database to execute a query that retrieves books based on the specified publication date criterion.

5. **Database Returns Results**: The database processes the server's query and returns a list of books that match the search criteria, sorted by their publication dates.

6. **Backend Server to Web Interface**: The server receives the sorted list of books from the database and sends this data back to the web interface.

7. **Web Interface Displays Results**: Finally, the web interface takes the response from the backend server and displays the sorted list of books to the library member. This step completes the user's request by providing them the sought-after information in an organized manner according to publication date.

This sequence diagram demonstrates a simplified interaction flow among the involved components to fulfill the user's request in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

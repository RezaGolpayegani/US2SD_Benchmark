Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML language for the described user story revolves around illustrating the process involved in the recruitment for the last round of user testing, including summarizing findings and synthesis of results. Given the complexity and the various steps involved in this process, the sequence diagram below provides a simplified outline of these steps within the context of the described project.

Please note, the sequence of actions detailed here assumes an interaction between a Researcher (as the primary actor), a Recruitment Platform/System, the User Database, potential participants, and the Research Analysis System or Tools.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
entity "Recruitment\nPlatform" as RecruitmentPlatform
database "User Database" as UserDb
actor Participant
entity "Research Analysis\nSystem" as AnalysisSystem

Researcher -> RecruitmentPlatform : define criteria for participant selection
RecruitmentPlatform -> UserDb : query potential participants based on criteria
UserDb -> RecruitmentPlatform : return list of potential participants
RecruitmentPlatform -> Participant : send recruitment invitations
Participant -> RecruitmentPlatform : respond to invitation
RecruitmentPlatform -> Researcher : provide list of participating users

alt successful recruitment
    Researcher -> Participant : conduct user research sessions
    Participant -> Researcher : provide feedback and data
else recruitment failure
    Researcher -> RecruitmentPlatform : adjust criteria/republish invitation
    RecruitmentPlatform -> UserDb : re-query potential participants
    loop on failure
        UserDb -> RecruitmentPlatform : return updated list of potential participants
        RecruitmentPlatform -> Participant : resend invitations
        Participant -> RecruitmentPlatform : respond to invitations
        RecruitmentPlatform -> Researcher : update on participant status
    end 
end

Researcher -> AnalysisSystem : input user research data
AnalysisSystem -> Analysisystem : analyze and summarize findings
AnalysisSystem-> Researcher : provide synthesized results

Researcher -> RecruitmentPlatform : update project status to "Complete"
Researcher -> AnalysisSystem : archive project data and findings

This diagram represents the sequence of actions initiated by the Researcher to recruit participants for user research, execute the testing sessions, and finally synthesize the results. It showcases the iterative recruitment process, how participants' responses influence the proceeding actions, and the culmination of the project in summarizing findings. 

- **Defining criteria for participant selection:** The Researcher inputs the selection criteria into the Recruitment Platform.
- **Query and invitation send-out:** The Recruitment Platform queries the User Database for potential participants and sends out invitations.
- **Participant response handling:** Participants respond, and the Recruitment Platform collects the responses.
- **Adjustment on recruitment failure:** Improves the recruitment process if needed.
- **Conduction of user research sessions:** Researcher conducts sessions with participants who accepted the invitation.
- **Data analysis and synthesis:** Researcher inputs data into the Research Analysis System, which analyzes and summarizes the findings.
- {plantuml}
- **Archiving and completion:** Finally, the Researcher updates the project status and archives data for future reference.

Given the comprehensive nature of the requested feature, detailing a sequence diagram for both searching books and placing reservations involves multiple actors and systems. Below is a PlantUML code representation that outlines the interactions between the user (Librarian), the front-end interface, and the back-end server, including a database for searching books and placing reservations.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Frontend Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Library Database" as DB

== Search Books ==
Librarian -> UI : Enter search criteria\n(title, author, category, publication date)
UI -> Backend : Send search request
Backend -> DB : Query books by criteria
DB --> Backend : Return book results
Backend --> UI : Display search results
UI --> Librarian : Show book results

== Place Reservation ==
Librarian -> UI : Selects book for reservation
UI -> Backend : Send reservation request\n(bookID, librarianID)
Backend -> DB : Check book availability
alt Book is available
    DB --> Backend : Book is available
    Backend -> DB : Create reservation\n(set book as reserved, add librarianID)
    DB --> Backend : Reservation confirmed
    Backend --> UI : Show reservation success
    UI --> Librarian : Display success message
else Book is unavailable
    DB --> Backend : Book is unavailable
    Backend --> UI : Show book unavailable message
    UI --> Librarian : Display unavailable message
end

This sequence diagram starts with the librarian entering search criteria into the frontend interface, which then communicates with the backend server. The server queries the library database for books that match the criteria and returns the results to the frontend, where they are displayed to the librarian.

For reservations, the process involves the librarian selecting a book to reserve through the frontend interface. The backend then checks the availability of the book in the database. If the book is available, a reservation is made, setting the book as reserved and associating it with the librarian's ID. The success of the reservation is then communicated back to the librarian through the interface. If the book is unavailable, a message indicating this is displayed instead.

This sequence diagram is a simplified representation meant to showcase the interactions for the specified user story within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) project. Depending on the specific technologies and detailed requirements, additional steps or alternative flows might be necessary.

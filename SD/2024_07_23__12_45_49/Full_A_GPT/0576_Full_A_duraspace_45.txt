Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the provided user story in PlantUML format requires capturing the interaction between the repository manager, the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS), and potentially other components of the system involved in the process of indicating additional rights on a component level. Below is an illustrative PlantUML sequence diagram that aligns with the scenario described in the user story.

Please note, to render the PlantUML diagram, you would need to use a PlantUML processor or an online PlantUML editor. 

```plantuml
@startuml

participant RepositoryManager as RM "Repository Manager"
participant DIMS_UI as UI "DIMS User Interface"
participant RightsManagementService as RMS "Rights Management Service"
participant Database as DB "Database"

RM -> UI : Access component rights interface
activate UI

UI -> RMS : Request current rights info
activate RMS

RMS -> DB : Query current rights
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Return current rights
deactivate DB

RMS --> UI : Display current rights
deactivate RMS

UI --> RM : Show current rights
RM -> UI : Indicate additional rights
UI -> RMS : Process additional rights
activate RMS

RMS -> DB : Update rights information
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Confirm update
deactivate DB

RMS --> UI : Indicate success
deactivate RMS
UI --> RM : Display success message
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps in the process:

1. The **Repository Manager** accesses the component rights management interface on the DIMS User Interface (UI).
2. The UI requests the current rights information for the component from the **Rights Management Service** (RMS).
3. The RMS queries the current rights from the **Database** and returns the information to the UI, which then shows it to the Repository Manager.
4. The Repository Manager indicates additional rights that pertain to the component through the UI.
5. The UI sends this information to the RMS to process the indicated additional rights.
6. The RMS updates the rights information in the Database and confirms the update.
7. The RMS sends an indication of success to the UI, which then displays a success message to the Repository Manager.

This diagram is a foundational overview and does not capture potential error handling, authentication, or authorization steps that would be necessary in a fully realized implementation. Adjustments and additions may be needed based on the specific technical and functional requirements of the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS).

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story where a member wants to see the fine they have to pay for delayed returns, we're going to define the interactions between various objects/components like the Member (User), Library Web Interface, Library Backend System, and Database. We are assuming here a simplified interaction flow based on the provided project description of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Here's a PlantUML code snippet representing the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Fine Calculation for Delayed Returns

actor Member as member
participant "Library Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Library Backend System" as backend
database "Database" as db

member -> webInterface : Request to view delayed returns fine
webInterface -> backend : Validate member session
alt session valid
  backend -> db : Fetch fines for delayed returns
  db -> backend : Return fines data
  backend -> webInterface : Show fines information
  webInterface -> member : Display fines due
else session invalid
  backend -> webInterface : Session timeout/error message
  webInterface -> member : Display session error, prompt re-login
end

@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates the process flow as follows:

1. The **Member** initiates the process by requesting to view the fines for delayed returns through the **Library Web Interface**.
2. The **Library Web Interface** forwards this request to the **Library Backend System** to validate the member's session to ensure the member is logged in and the session is active.
   - If the session is **valid**, the process continues:
     1. The **Library Backend System** then requests the fines information for delayed returns from the **Database**.
     2. The **Database** returns the fines data to the **Library Backend System**.
     3. The **Library Backend System** forwards this information to the **Library Web Interface**, which in turn displays the fines due to the **Member**.
   - If the session is **invalid** (e.g., the member is not logged in or the session has expired):
     1. The **Library Backend System** sends a session timeout or error message to the **Library Web Interface**.
     2. The **Library Web Interface** then displays a session error to the **Member** and prompts them to log in again.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of how a member can view the fines for delayed returns within the CLMS, detailing the interactions between the user interface, the backend system, and the data layer. The actual implementation may involve more detailed steps based on specific business rules, security considerations, and additional features within the CLMS.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story—seeing the borrowed books along with their due dates—demands an understanding of the interactions between different parts of the system. Here’s a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

member -> ui : Select "My Borrowed Books"
ui -> server : Request borrowed books list
server -> db : Query borrowed books and due dates
db -> server : Return books data
server -> ui : Display borrowed books with due dates
ui -> member : Show borrowed books list with due dates

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram describes the following steps:
1. The member starts the action by selecting (or clicking) an option labeled "My Borrowed Books" in the user interface (UI).
2. The UI Interface sends a request to the server to fetch the list of the member's borrowed books along with their due dates.
3. The server processes this request and sends a query to the database to retrieve the data for the books the member has borrowed, including the due dates for each book.
4. The database processes this query and returns the borrowed books' data to the server.
5. The server then sends this data back to the UI Interface.
6. Finally, the UI Interface displays the list of borrowed books along with their due dates for the member to view.

This sequence delineates how the system allows a member to view the books they have borrowed and when those books are due, facilitating efficient book return and management for library members.

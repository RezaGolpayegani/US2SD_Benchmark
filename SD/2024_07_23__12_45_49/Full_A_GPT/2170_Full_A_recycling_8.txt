Certainly! To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story where a user wants to register their email ID to receive notifications for new events, we will assume a basic flow of interactions between the user, the RecycleSmart platform's interface, the system back-end, and potentially an email service provider. The sequence diagram in PlantUML language will detail these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant "RecycleSmart Interface" as UI
participant "System Backend" as SB
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Email Service" as ES

U -> UI : Enters Email ID
UI -> SB : Validate Email
alt Valid Email
    SB -> DB : Store Email ID
    DB --> SB : Confirmation of Email ID Stored
    SB -> ES : Subscribe to Notification Service
    ES --> SB : Confirmation of Subscription
    SB --> UI : Show Success Message
else Invalid Email
    SB --> UI : Show Error Message (Invalid Email)
end
UI --> U : Display Confirmation/Error Message

```

This diagram outlines the process as follows:
1. **User Interaction**: The user enters their email ID into the RecycleSmart interface to receive notifications.
2. **Validation**: The system backend validates the email ID. If the email is valid, the process continues; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
3. **Database Storage**: Upon validation, the backend requests the database to store the email ID.
4. **Subscription**: The system then interacts with an email service to subscribe the user to notification services.
5. **Confirmation**: After successful subscription, a success message is displayed to the user. If there were any issues (for instance, invalid email), an appropriate error message is displayed instead.

This sequence ensures that the user is properly notified about their subscription status and that their email ID is handled securely and efficiently throughout the process.

To illustrate how an ethics manager interacts with the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool) to be informed about the data for checking sensitivity, below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This diagram focuses on the processes involved when an ethics manager requests data sensitivity information and receives the necessary details to proceed with their evaluation.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Ethics Manager" as EM
participant "DMPTool Interface" as DMP_UI
participant "Data Retrieval System" as DRS
participant "Metadata Repository" as MR
participant "Security & Sensitivity\nAssessment Module" as SSAM

== Request for Data Sensitivity Information ==
EM -> DMP_UI : Request(Data Information)
activate DMP_UI
DMP_UI -> DRS : Fetch Data Details()
activate DRS
DRS -> MR : Retrieve Metadata()
activate MR
MR --> DRS : Data Metadata
deactivate MR
DRS --> DMP_UI : Data Details
deactivate DRS
DMP_UI -> SSAM : Check Sensitivity(Data Details)
activate SSAM
SSAM -> SSAM : Evaluate Sensitivity Level()
SSAM --> DMP_UI : Sensitivity Report
deactivate SSAM
DMP_UI --> EM : Display Sensitivity Report
deactivate DMP_UI

This sequence diagram outlines the following process:
1. The ethics manager initiates a request for information on data sensitivity by interacting with the DMPTool interface.
2. The DMPTool interface then forwards this request to the data retrieval system to fetch relevant data details.
3. The data retrieval system queries the metadata repository to retrieve metadata associated with the requested data.
4. The metadata repository responds with the requested data metadata.
5. The data retrieval system sends the retrieved data details back to the DMPTool interface.
6. The DMPTool interface then requests an evaluation of the data's sensitivity level from the security & sensitivity assessment module, providing it with the data details.
7. The security & sensitivity assessment module processes this information, evaluates the sensitivity level of the data, and generates a sensitivity report.
8. Finally, the DMPTool interface presents the sensitivity report to the ethics manager, informing them of the dataâ€™s sensitivity levels and allowing them to proceed with their checks accordingly.

Using this diagram, stakeholders can understand how the DMPTool facilitates communication and processes to aid an ethics manager in assessing data sensitivity, ensuring compliance and ethical management of research data.

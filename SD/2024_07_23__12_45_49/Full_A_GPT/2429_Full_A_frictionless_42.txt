Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the provided user story involves illustrating the interaction between the user (publisher), the DPIE system, the Excel integration component, and any other relevant subsystems for outputting cleaned Data Packages. Below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format, detailing these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher as publisher
participant "DPIE System" as DPIE
participant "Excel Integration" as Excel
participant "Data Package Cleaner" as Cleaner
database "Data Package" as DataPkg

== Export Cleaned Data Package to Excel ==

publisher -> DPIE: Request Excel output for Data Package
activate DPIE

DPIE -> Cleaner: Send Data Package for cleaning
activate Cleaner
Cleaner -> DataPkg: Validate and Clean Data
activate DataPkg
DataPkg --> Cleaner: Cleaned Data Package
deactivate DataPkg

Cleaner --> DPIE: Cleaned Data Package
deactivate Cleaner

DPIE -> Excel: Request Excel output for Cleaned Data Package
activate Excel
Excel -> DataPkg: Fetch Cleaned Data Package
activate DataPkg
DataPkg --> Excel: Cleaned Data Package Data
deactivate DataPkg

Excel -> Excel: Generate Excel File from Data Package
Excel --> DPIE: Excel File
deactivate Excel

DPIE --> publisher: Excel File with Cleaned Data Package
deactivate DPIE

This diagram starts with the publisher requesting an Excel output for a Data Package through the DPIE System. DPIE then interacts with a Data Package Cleaner component to validate and clean the Data Package. Once cleaned, the Data Package information is sent to the Excel Integration component, which is responsible for generating an Excel file from the cleaned data. Finally, the generated Excel file is returned to the publisher through the DPIE System.

This sequence is a simplified representation and assumes the existence of a "Data Package Cleaner" for validation and cleaning processes, and it considers direct interaction between the Excel integration and the Data Package for fetching data. Depending on the DPIE's architecture, there might be additional steps or systems involved in these processes.

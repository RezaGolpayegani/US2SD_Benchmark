Given your request to detail a sequence diagram for the specified user story within the larger project context, I've outlined a PlantUML script that describes these interactions. This sequence diagram focuses on the process from developing a user research protocol for internal workflows to beginning testing against a CMS prototype from the perspective of a researcher.

Please note that for the sake of simplicity and clarity, some detailed steps (like sub-processes within each main action) might be summarized. PlantUML does an excellent job of handling these interactions, but make sure to customize the script further if you need more granularity.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Researcher as R
participant "Project Lead" as PL
participant "Design Team" as DT
participant "Development Team" as DevT
participant CMS as CMS


R -> PL : Propose research on internal workflows
note right: Researcher outlines\nobjectives and needs\nfor user research.
PL --> R : Approves and provides resources
R -> DT : Consults on design constraints
DT --> R : Confirms design capabilities
R -> DevT : Requests prototype readiness
DevT --> R : Confirms prototype is ready for testing

note over R, CMS : Development of User Research Protocol
R -> R : Develops protocol\nincluding tasks, questions,\nand success metrics

R -> CMS : Implements protocol in CMS prototype
note right: Protocol covers content creation,\nedition, and management workflows

loop Test Iterations
    R -> CMS : Executes protocol tests
    CMS --> R : Provides test outcomes
    R -> R : Analyzes results
end

R -> PL : Reports findings and recommendations
PL -> DevT : Discuss modifications based on feedback
DevT --> PL : Confirms feasibility and timelines
PL -> R : Approves proceeding with changes

note over R, PL: Adjustments to protocol\nand prototype may be required\nbased on feedback and outcomes

This diagram starts with the initial interactions between the researcher and the project lead, moving through consultations, development, testing, and feedback loops. It assumes that the researcher is central to both the development of the user research protocol and the oversight of its implementation within a CMS prototype context.

For a real-world scenario, you might need to iterate on this to include more stakeholders or detail specific sub-processes within each of these main stages, especially around the iterative testing and refinement of the CMS prototype based on researcher findings and team feedback.

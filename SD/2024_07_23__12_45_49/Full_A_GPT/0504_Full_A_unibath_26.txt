To create a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story "As a data reuser, I want to view an example citation for a dataset, so that I can reference it correctly," we need to describe the interactions between different system components and the user involved in the process of viewing an example citation for a dataset. This interaction includes accessing the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, searching for the dataset, selecting it, and then viewing the example citation.

Here is an example of how to translate this process into a sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataReuser as "Data Reuser"
participant WebInterface as "Web Interface"
participant SearchModule as "Search Module"
participant DatasetManagement as "Dataset Management"
participant CitationGenerator as "Citation Generator"

DataReuser -> WebInterface : Access platform
WebInterface -> SearchModule : Search for dataset
SearchModule -> WebInterface : Display search results
DataReuser -> WebInterface : Select dataset
WebInterface -> DatasetManagement : Request selected dataset details
DatasetManagement -> CitationGenerator : Request example citation
CitationGenerator -> DatasetManagement : Return example citation
DatasetManagement -> WebInterface : Display dataset details and example citation
WebInterface -> DataReuser : Show dataset details and example citation

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in a data reuser interacting with the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform to view an example citation of a dataset. It starts with the data reuser accessing the platform and ends with them viewing the dataset details and example citation, involving interactions with the web interface, search module, dataset management system, and citation generator.

To visualize this diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML syntax. Once you input this code into a compatible tool, it will generate a sequence diagram that visualizes the process described in the user story. This sequence diagram can be further detailed or adjusted according to specific implementation details and system architecture of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform.

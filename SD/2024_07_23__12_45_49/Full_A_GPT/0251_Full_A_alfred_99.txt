Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an OlderPerson, I want to have ALFRED to set limits in the games duration as I get bored easily" involves depicting interaction between the user, ALFRED, and potentially other components involved in managing game settings and session duration. Below is a PlantUML source code that represents such a sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED Interface" as alfred
participant "Games Library" as games
participant "Settings Manager" as settings
database "User Preferences" as preferences

user -> alfred : Request to adjust game duration
alfred -> games : Fetch available games
games --> alfred : Display games list
alfred -> user : Show games with adjustable durations
user -> alfred : Select game and desired duration
alfred -> settings : Request duration limit adjustment
settings -> preferences : Update user-specific game settings
preferences --> settings : Confirm update
settings --> alfred : Confirm duration limit set
alfred -> user : Confirm new game duration limit

This diagram describes the following steps:

1. The user (OlderPerson) initiates a request to adjust the duration for game play. This interaction is between the user and ALFRED's user interface.
2. ALFRED communicates with the Games Library to fetch the list of available games that allow for duration adjustments.
3. The Games Library responds with the list.
4. ALFRED then displays the games that have adjustable durations to the user.
5. The user selects the desired game and specifies the new duration limit they want.
6. ALFRED conveys this request to the Settings Manager, tasked with adjusting settings such as game duration limits.
7. The Settings Manager updates these preferences in the User Preferences database where individual settings are stored.
8. The User Preferences database confirms the update.
9. The Settings Manager confirms with ALFRED that the duration limit has been set according to the user's request.
10. ALFRED then confirms to the user that the new game duration limit has been set.

This sequence ensures that the user is able to control and personalize their gaming experience according to their preferences, enhancing their engagement without overwhelming them.

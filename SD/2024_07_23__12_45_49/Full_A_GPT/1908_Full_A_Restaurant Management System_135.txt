Here is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format capturing the process of a manager editing employee details in the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This takes into account the interactions between the manager, the system interface, the server, and the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Manager Editing Employee Details

actor Manager as mgr
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Server" as srv
participant "Database" as db

mgr -> ui : Select employee management\noption from dashboard
ui -> srv : Request employee list
srv -> db : Query employee list
db -> srv : Return employee list
srv -> ui : Display employee list
mgr -> ui : Select employee to edit
ui -> srv : Request employee details
srv -> db : Query selected employee details
db -> srv : Return employee details
srv -> ui : Display employee details form

mgr -> ui : Edits employee details
ui -> srv : Send updated employee details
srv -> db : Update employee details in database
alt Success
  db -> srv : Confirm details updated
  srv -> ui : Show success message to Manager
  mgr -> ui : Acknowledges confirmation
else Failure
  db -> srv : Return error message
  srv -> ui : Show error message to Manager
  mgr -> ui: Attempt to edit details again
end

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved when a manager wants to edit employee details through the Restaurant Management and Operations System. It starts with the manager selecting the option to manage employee details from the dashboard, followed by the system presenting a list of employees. The manager then selects an employee to edit, and the system fetches and displays the details of that employee in a form. The manager makes the desired changes and submits them, after which the system updates these details in the database and confirms the update to the manager.

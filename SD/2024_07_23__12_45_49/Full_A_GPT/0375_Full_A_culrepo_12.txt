Given your request, I'll provide a PlantUML sequence diagram sketch that visualizes the interactions for a user story focused on a cross-department project team member who wants to organize, tag, and share project materials with varying access levels. In this scenario, assume that the user interacts with the digital repository system's interface to upload, classify, and set permissions for project materials.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant WebInterface as WI
participant AuthenticationSystem as AS
participant ContentManagementService as CMS
participant Database as DB
participant AccessControl as AC

U -> WI: Navigate to upload section
activate WI
WI -> AS: Prompt for authentication
activate AS
U -> AS: Provide credentials
AS -> AS: Validate credentials
AS --> WI: Authentication success
deactivate AS

U -> WI: Select and upload project materials
WI -> CMS: Initiate upload process
activate CMS
CMS -> DB: Store meta-data and files
activate DB
DB --> CMS: Confirm storage
deactivate DB

U -> WI: Specify organization and tagging
WI -> CMS: Update meta-data with tags & organization
CMS -> DB: Update record
DB --> CMS: Record updated
activate DB
deactivate DB

U -> WI: Set access levels (private, university, public)
WI -> AC: Apply access control settings
activate AC
AC -> DB: Update access settings
DB --> AC: Access settings updated
deactivate DB

AC --> WI: Access control set
deactivate AC
CMS --> WI: Upload and settings confirmed
deactivate CMS

WI --> U: Display success message
deactivate WI

In this sequence diagram:

1. **User (U):** Represents the cross-department project team member who interacts with the system.
2. **Web Interface (WI):** Acts as the intermediary through which the user navigates and inputs data.
3. **Authentication System (AS):** Ensures that the user has appropriate credentials to upload and modify materials.
4. **Content Management Service (CMS):** Manages the uploading, organization, and tagging of digital materials in the repository.
5. **Database (DB):** Persists data concerning the files, metadata, and access settings.
6. **Access Control (AC):** Handles the logic for setting access levels on uploaded materials based on the user's specifications (private, university-wide, or public).

Please adjust this sketch according to the specific tools, protocols, or frameworks your implementation might utilize, as well as any additional steps or interactions that are unique to your project context.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to see the listing of books" involves illustrating the interaction between the user, front-end interface, back-end server, and the database that facilitates fetching and displaying book listings in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Below is a representation of this user story in PlantUML format, which you can compile using a PlantUML compiler or integrate into a documentation that supports PlantUML diagrams:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor User as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Database" as db

== User Requests Book Listing ==

user -> web: Request list of books
activate user
activate web

web -> backend: GET /books
activate backend

backend -> db: SELECT * FROM books
activate db

db --> backend: BookList
deactivate db

backend --> web: Response(BookList)
deactivate backend

web --> user: Display BookList
deactivate web
deactivate user

@enduml
```

This diagram simplifies the process to focus on the main interactions for this specific user story. Here's a breakdown of the flow:

1. **User Requests Book Listing**: The user interacts with the web interface to request the listing of books. This action can be triggered by navigating to a specific section of the CLMS or performing a search operation without any specific query to fetch all books.

2. **Web Interface**: Acts as the middleman between the user and the backend server. It sends the user's request to the backend server to fetch the book listings.

3. **Backend Server**: Upon receiving the request from the web interface, the backend server queries the database to fetch the list of all books available in the library. This might involve querying a "books" table or a similar structure where book information is stored.

4. **Database**: The database processes the backend server's query and returns the list of books (BookList) to the backend server.

5. **Backend Server**: The backend server processes the data received from the database, possibly formatting or filtering the raw data as necessary, and sends it back to the web interface.

6. **Web Interface**: The web interface receives the book listings (BookList) from the backend server and displays it to the user. This can include book titles, authors, availability, and possibly cover images or additional metadata.

7. **User**: The user views the list of books displayed by the web interface and can proceed with further actions like selecting a book for more details, reserving a book, or initiating a new search.

The diagram and description provide a simplified view of the interactions within the CLMS when a user wants to see the list of books. Depending on the project's specifics, additional details like API endpoints, database schema, and error handling can be integrated into the sequence diagram for a more comprehensive representation.

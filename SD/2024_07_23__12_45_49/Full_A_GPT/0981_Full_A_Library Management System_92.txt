To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a librarian, I want to see the delayed books by a particular reader, so that I can warn him/her,” we will outline the following participants in the interaction:
- Librarian: The person who initiates the process by looking up delayed books.
- Library System: The backend system that processes requests and returns results.
- Database: Where all the information about books, users, and borrow status is stored.

The sequence diagram in PlantUML language would be structured as following:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Librarian
participant LibrarySystem
database Database

== Check Delayed Books By Reader ==
Librarian -> LibrarySystem : Request delayed books for Reader_ID
activate LibrarySystem

LibrarySystem -> Database : Query delayed books for Reader_ID
activate Database

Database --> LibrarySystem : Return list of delayed books
deactivate Database

LibrarySystem --> Librarian : Display delayed books
deactivate LibrarySystem

Librarian -> LibrarySystem : Select books to send warning
activate LibrarySystem

LibrarySystem -> Database : Update warning status for selected books
activate Database

Database --> LibrarySystem : Acknowledge status update
deactivate Database

LibrarySystem --> Librarian : Show warning sent confirmation
deactivate LibrarySystem

Here’s a breakdown of the steps in this sequence diagram:
1. The librarian requests to see the delayed books for a particular reader by providing the reader's ID to the library system.
2. The library system then queries the database for books borrowed by the reader that are overdue.
3. The database returns the list of delayed books to the library system.
4. The library system displays the delayed books to the librarian.
5. The librarian selects which books to send a warning for.
6. The library system updates the warning status of these selected books in the database.
7. The database acknowledges the status update.
8. Finally, the library system shows a confirmation to the librarian that a warning has been sent.

This diagram assumes the library system has features for identifying delayed books, managing warnings, and interacting with a database to update and retrieve data.

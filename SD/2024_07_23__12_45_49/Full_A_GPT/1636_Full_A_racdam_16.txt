To visualize the process described in the user story "As an archivist, I want to upload a single file" from the described Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project, I'll outline a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML. The steps include the archivist selecting a file, uploading it, the system processing this file (including metadata entry and license/rights assignment), and confirming the successful upload.

Please note, for actual execution and rendering, you would need to use a PlantUML environment or compatible tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist
participant "Upload Interface" as UI
participant "Server" as Server
participant "File Processing Module" as FPM
participant "Metadata Management" as MM
participant "Rights Management" as RM
participant "Database" as DB

== Upload Process ==
Archivist -> UI : Selects file to upload
UI -> Server : Sends file
activate Server

Server -> FPM : Process file for upload
activate FPM
FPM -> MM : Assign unique identifier\nand request metadata
activate MM
Archivist -> MM : Enter metadata (title, date, creator)
MM -> RM : Request licensing/rights assignment
activate RM
Archivist -> RM : Applies license/rights
deactivate MM
RM -> FPM : Confirm licensing/rights settings
deactivate RM

FPM -> DB : Store file and metadata
activate DB
DB --> FPM : Confirm storage
deactivate DB
FPM -> Server : Upload successful
deactivate FPM
Server -> UI : Display confirmation message
deactivate Server
UI -> Archivist : Shows success message to Archivist

This sequence diagram illustrates the process flow when an archivist wants to upload a single file to the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project's system. Here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. **Archivist selects a file to upload**: This is the initial action where the archivist chooses the file intended for upload through the Upload Interface.
2. **The file is sent to the server**: The chosen file is transmitted to the server to be processed.
3. **File Processing Module processes the file**: The server initiates the File Processing Module to handle the file, which entails preparing the file for storage.
4. **Metadata Management requests and receives metadata**: The file needs metadata for proper categorization and retrieval. The Archivist provides this information.
5. **Rights Management assigns license/rights**: To adhere to legal and ethical standards, license and rights are applied to the file by the Archivist through the Rights Management system.
6. **Database stores file and metadata**: With all necessary data and permissions in place, the file and its metadata are stored in the database.
7. **Confirmation of successful upload**: Upon successful storage, a confirmation message is relayed back to the Archivist.

This detailed sequence ensures that all critical steps for uploading a single file are considered, complying with the envisioned digital archive enhancement's objectives and features.

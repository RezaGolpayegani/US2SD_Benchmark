Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story provided requires depicting the interactions between the user (in this case, an anonymous user) and the system components involved in displaying summit details, registration, and location assistance. Below is a PlantUML code representation of the interactions based on the BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform's requirements:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AnonymousUser as User
participant "UI: Summit List" as UI1
participant "Summit Controller" as Controller
database "Summit Database" as DB
participant "Registration System" as RegSys
participant "Navigation System" as NavSys

User -> UI1: Browse summits
UI1 -> Controller: Request summit details
Controller -> DB: Query summit details
DB -> Controller: Return summit details
Controller -> UI1: Display summits & details
User -> UI1: Select a summit
UI1 -> Controller: Request registration & location details
Controller -> RegSys: Query registration info
RegSys -> Controller: Return registration status & link
Controller -> NavSys: Request location details
NavSys -> Controller: Return location info & map
Controller -> UI1: Display registration info & map
User -> RegSys: Follow registration link
RegSys -> User: Provide registration form
User -> RegSys: Submit registration data
RegSys -> User: Confirm registration
User -> NavSys: Request directions
NavSys -> User: Provide directions & tips

This sequence diagram starts with the user browsing summit listings on the platform. The web interface (UI: Summit List) requests summit details from the Summit Controller, which queries the Summit Database for information. Once retrieved, the details are displayed to the user.

When a user selects a summit, the system fetches and displays registration information and map/location details through interactions with the Registration System and Navigation System, respectively. The user can follow the registration link to the Registration System to complete the event registration, and similarly, request directions from the Navigation Member.

Please note, while this diagram provides a high-level overview of interactions based on the project description provided, the actual implementation may involve additional steps or systems (e.g., authentication checks for registration or more detailed interaction with the navigation system).

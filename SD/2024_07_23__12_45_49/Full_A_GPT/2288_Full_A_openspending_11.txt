Given the user story and the project it's a part of, below is a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format representing the process of importing data in JSON format into the OpenSpending platform. This sequence diagram assumes the existence of a user interface (UI) for data publishers, an underlying data packager service that processes file imports, and possibly a backend service to validate and store uploaded JSON files.

Please note, this diagram assumes a simple flow for importing data; actual implementations might involve more complex interactions especially concerning authentication, validation, and error handling.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as user
participant "UI" as ui
participant "Data Packager" as datapackager
participant "Backend Service" as backend

user -> ui : Select "Import Data"
ui -> user : Display Import Options
user -> ui : Choose JSON File
ui -> datapackager : Send JSON for Parsing
activate datapackager

datapackager -> backend : Validate JSON Format
activate backend
backend -> backend : Check JSON against Schema
backend --> datapackager : Validation Result
deactivate backend

alt If JSON is valid
    datapackager -> backend : Store JSON Data
    activate backend
    backend --> datapackager : Confirm Data Stored
    deactivate backend
    datapackager -> ui : Display Success Message
    ui -> user : Confirm Successful Import
else If JSON is invalid
    datapackager -> ui : Display Error Message
    ui -> user : Show Error and Options
end

deactivate datapackager
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. The user selects to import data and is presented with import options by the UI.
2. The user chooses a JSON file to import.
3. The UI sends the JSON file to the Data Packager for parsing.
4. The Data Packager requests the Backend Service to validate the format of the JSON file.
5. The Backend Service checks the JSON file against a predefined schema.
6. If the JSON is valid, it is stored, and a success message is displayed to the user.
7. If the JSON is invalid, an error message is shown, with options on how to proceed.

This is a simplified representation. Implementers might need to consider additional functionality, including but not reading directly from URLs, handling larger files asynchronously, enriching the JSON data with metadata, and dealing with versioning of datasets.

Given the project description and the specific user story, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process for a Publisher who wants to preview the views of the current data package using CLI tools before publishing. This allows the Publisher to refine the JSON declarations of the data package view section for optimizing the presentation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "CLI Tool" as CLI
participant "Validation Service" as Validator
participant "Preview Service" as Preview
participant "Data Package Registry" as Registry

Publisher -> CLI : run preview command with data package path
CLI -> Validator : validate JSON schema of data package
alt if validation fails
    Validator -> CLI : return validation errors
    CLI -> Publisher : display errors
else if validation succeeds
    Validator -> CLI : validation success
    CLI -> Preview : generate preview of data package views
    Preview -> CLI : display generated preview
    CLI -> Publisher : show preview output
end

### Process Explanation:

1. **Publisher Initiates Preview**: The Publisher uses the CLI tool to run a preview command, providing the path to the current data package they are working on.

2. **Data Package Validation**: The CLI tool contacts the Validation Service to validate the JSON schema of the data package. This ensures that the package is correctly structured before attempting to generate a preview.

2.1. **Validation Fails**: If the validation fails, the Validation Service returns errors to the CLI tool, which then displays these errors to the Publisher. The Publisher must correct these errors before proceeding.

2.2. **Validation Succeeds**: If the validation succeeds, the process continues to the next step.

3. **Preview Generation**: The CLI tool sends a request to the Preview Service to generate a preview of the data package views based on the current JSON declarations.

4. **Displaying Preview**: The Preview Service returns the generated preview to the CLI tool, which then displays it to the Publisher. This allows the Publisher to visually inspect how the data package views will appear once published.

5. **Refining JSON Declarations**: Based on the preview, the Publisher can refine the JSON declarations in the data package view section to achieve the desired presentation. This iterative process can be repeated until the Publisher is satisfied with the results.

This sequence diagram captures the core interactions involved in previewing the views of a data package before publishing, enabling the Publisher to refine the presentation based on visual feedback.

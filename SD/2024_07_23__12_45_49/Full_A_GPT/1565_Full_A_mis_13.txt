Given your request, I will provide a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the process described in your user story. This User Story involves several steps: the encryption of a collection with a key, the generation and storage of a checksum for the encrypted file, and the replication of the encrypted file to a remote storage site. 

Please note, this diagram assumes an interaction among several components: the Collection Curator, the EDRMS System (which encompasses encryption, checksum generation, and file replication functionalities), and the Remote Storage Site. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Collection Curator" as curator
participant "EDRMS System" as system
participant "Remote Storage Site" as storage

curator -> system : Request file encryption
activate system

system -> system : Encrypt file with maintained key
system -> system : Generate checksum of encrypted file
system --> curator : Confirm file encryption and checksum

curator -> system : Request file replication to remote storage
system -> storage : Replicate encrypted file
activate storage

storage -> storage : Store encrypted file
storage --> system : Confirm file storage

system --> curator : Confirm file replicated and stored
deactivate system
deactivate storage

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram represents the process starting from the collection curator requesting file encryption, through the EDRMS system processing this request—encrypting the file, generating a checksum, confirming these actions with the curator—then replicating the encrypted file to the remote storage site, and finally confirming the successful replication and storage back to the curator.

Please ensure your PlantUML environment or online PlantUML editor is set up to render this code into a visual sequence diagram.

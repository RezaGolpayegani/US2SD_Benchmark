Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrating the process where a Database/Information Retrieval (DB/IR) administrator manages customizable relationship groups to support the "see also" option for patrons. This sequence delineates the interactions between the DB/IR administrator, the digital repository system, and the database to create and manage these relationship groups, ultimately allowing patrons to discover related content.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "Digital Repository Interface" as ui
participant "Relationship Group Management" as rgm
participant "Database" as db

== Manage Customizable Relationship Groups ==

admin -> ui : Access Relationship Group Management
activate admin
activate ui

ui -> rgm : Request Relationship Group Form
activate rgm

rgm -> ui : Provide Relationship Group Form
ui -> admin : Display Relationship Group Form

admin -> ui : Submit New Relationship Group Details
ui -> rgm : Validate Submission
activate db
rgm -> db : Check Existing Groups
db -> rgm : Validation Results

alt If validation passes
    rgm -> db : Create/Update Relationship Group
    db -> rgm : Acknowledge Update
    rgm -> ui : Confirm Creation/Update to Admin
    ui -> admin : Display Success Message
else If validation fails
    rgm -> ui : Inform Failure (Details Exists/Invalid)
    ui -> admin : Display Error Message
end

== Patron "See Also" Support ==
note over db : Ensure related content\nis dynamically linked\nbased on groups

admin -> ui : Request to View Relationship Group Effect
ui -> db : Retrieve Sample Related Content
db -> ui : Provide Sample Related Content
ui -> admin : Display How "See Also" Appears to Patrons

admin -> ui : Confirm/Adjust Relationship Groups
ui -> rgm : Admin Makes Final Adjustments
rgm -> db : Update Relationship Settings
db -> rgm : Confirm Updates
rgm -> ui : Notify Update Success
ui -> admin : Display Update Success Confirmation

deactivate admin
deactivate ui
deactivate rgm
deactivate db

This diagram presents a scenario where the administrator interacts with the digital repository system to manage relationship groups, including the creation, validation, adjustment, and finalization phases to support the patron "see also" option. The sequence also incorporates decision points based on the validation of the new or updated relationship group against existing data, and it demonstrates how the system presents the anticipated outcome to administrators, enabling them to see how the "see also" function will appear to patrons and make required adjustments.

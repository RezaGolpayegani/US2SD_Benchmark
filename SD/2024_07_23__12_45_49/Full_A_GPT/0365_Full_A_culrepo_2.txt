To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story, we first outline the key steps involved in the process of a faculty member directing students to an item within the repository. After identifying these steps, we can create the corresponding PlantUML code.

### User Story Steps:
1. **Faculty Member Initiates Search:** The faculty member logs into the digital repository system and begins a search for the specific item they wish to link to.
2. **System Processes Search Query:** The system receives the search query, processes it, and returns the relevant search results.
3. **Faculty Member Selects Item:** From the search results, the faculty member identifies and selects the item they want to use for teaching.
4. **Access Item Details:** The system displays the detailed page for the selected item, including all metadata and a permanent link (permalink) to the item.
5. **Faculty Member Copies Permalink:** The faculty member copies the permalink provided by the system.
6. **Share With Students:** The faculty member shares the copied permalink with students through the course management system, email, or another communication platform.

### PlantUML Sequence Diagram Code:
```plantuml

@startuml

participant "Faculty Member" as FM
participant "System" as SYS
participant "Course Management System" as CMS

activate FM

FM -> SYS : Log in
activate SYS

FM -> SYS : Search for Item
SYS -> SYS : Process Search Query
SYS --> FM : Display Search Results

deactivate SYS

FM -> SYS : Select Item
activate SYS

SYS -> SYS : Retrieve Item Details
SYS --> FM : Display Item Details & Permalink

FM -> SYS : Copy Permalink
deactivate SYS

FM -> CMS : Share Permalink with Students
activate CMS
CMS --> FM : Confirmation

deactivate FM
deactivate CMS

### Notes:
- **FM** represents the Faculty Member.
- **SYS** stands for the comprehensive digital repository system.
- **CMS** denotes the Course Management System where the faculty member might share the permalink.

This sequence diagram illustrates the process flow as described in the user story, from initiating a search in the repository to sharing an item's permalink with students. Adjustments might be needed based on specific system functionalities or additional steps in the process.

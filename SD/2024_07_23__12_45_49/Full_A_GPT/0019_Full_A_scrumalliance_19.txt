Given your request to depict the user story "As a site member, I want to subscribe to an RSS feed of news, so that I remain sufficiently and easily informed." as a PlantUML sequence diagram, let's structure the sequence focusing on key interactions involved in subscribing to an RSS feed. This will cover the user's actions, the system's response, and the interaction with the RSS feed system. 

Here's a basic representation in PlantUML code to illustrate the sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant "Scrum Alliance Platform" as SAP
participant "RSS Feed System" as RSS

U->SAP: Access News Section
activate SAP

SAP->SAP: Display News List
SAP->U: Show RSS Feed Subscription Option
deactivate SAP

U->SAP: Choose to Subscribe to RSS Feed
activate SAP

SAP->RSS: Request RSS Feed Subscription
activate RSS

RSS->SAP: Confirm Subscription
deactivate RSS

SAP->U: Confirm RSS Feed Subscription
deactivate SAP
@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the user accessing the news section of the Scrum Alliance Platform. The platform then shows the news list along with an option to subscribe to the RSS feed. The user chooses to subscribe, leading the platform to interact with the RSS Feed System to request a subscription. Upon confirmation from the RSS Feed System, the Scrum Alliance Platform then confirms the RSS feed subscription to the user.

This is a simplified example covering the main interactions. Depending on your project's complexity and specific requirements, you might need to add more details like error handling, user authentication, or more in-depth interaction with the RSS system.

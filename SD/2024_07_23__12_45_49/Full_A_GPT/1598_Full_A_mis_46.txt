Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a repoadan, I want to provide a Linked Data interface to the repository" involves depicting the interactions between different parts of the system to implement a Linked Data interface. Due to the textual limitations, I'll outline a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format that you can adjust or expand based on specific functionalities or technologies you are using within the EDRMS project.

This example assumes the repoadmin initiates the process, interacts with the EDRMS configuration system to enable a Linked Data interface, and involves subsequent interactions with a Linked Data module or service that sets up the necessary endpoints, mappings, and publishes data.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Repoadmin as admin
participant "EDRMS Configuration System" as config
participant "Linked Data Module" as ld
participant "Data Repository" as repo
participant "Public Interface" as public

== Enable Linked Data Interface ==
admin -> config : Access EDRMS Configuration
activate config
config -> ld : Activate Linked Data Interface
activate ld
ld -> ld : Configure Base URI
ld -> ld : Map Repository Data to RDF
ld -> repo : Fetch Data for RDF Mapping
activate repo
repo --> ld : Data Set
deactivate repo
ld -> ld : Generate RDF Triples
ld -> public : Publish Linked Data Endpoint
activate public
public --> ld : Endpoint URL
deactivate public
ld --> config : Configuration Success
deactivate ld
config --> admin : Linked Data Interface Enabled
deactivate config

```

This diagram illustrates a basic flow:
1. **Repoadmin Accesses EDRMS Configuration**: The repository administrator (repoadmim) accesses the system's configuration panel to enable a Linked Data interface.
2. **Activate Linked Data Interface**: The system's configuration activates the Linked Data module, which is responsible for setting up the Linked Data features.
3. **Linked Data Module Configuration**: The Linked Data module performs several actions, including configuring the base URI for the Linked Data service, mapping repository data to RDF (Resource Description Framework), fetching data from the repository to map, generating RDF triples, and publishing a Linked Data endpoint.
4. **Publish Linked Data Endpoint**: The endpoint through which the Linked Data can be accessed publicly is set up and made available.
5. **Confirmation of Success**: Finally, the Linked Data interface's enablement and configuration are confirmed to the repoadmin.

This diagram is simplified and can be further detailed depending on the specifics of the EDRMS project, including more detailed interactions with external systems, error handling, security considerations, and the use of standard Linked Data technologies like SPARQL for querying RDF data.

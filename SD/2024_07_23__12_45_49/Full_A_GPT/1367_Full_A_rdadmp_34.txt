Creating a sequence diagram for the specified user story involves outlining the interactions between actors and the system for the scenario where an archive manager wants to reuse information regarding file format for applying automated file validation checks. To visualize this in PlantUML format, follow the sequence of steps which typically includes triggering the action by the archive manager, querying the DMPTool for file format information, retrieving the necessary data, and finally, using that data to initiate automated file validation checks.

Here's how this scenario could be broken down into a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor ArchiveManager as "Archive Manager"
participant DMPTool as "DMPTool"
participant Database as "Database"
participant ValidationService as "Validation Service"

== File Format Reuse & Validation Sequence ==

ArchiveManager -> DMPTool : Request file format information
DMPTool -> Database : Query file format details
Database -> DMPTool : Return file format information
DMPTool -> ArchiveManager : Provide file format data
ArchiveManager -> ValidationService : Trigger file validation using file format info
Validation
ValidationService -> ArchiveManager : Return validation results

@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates the following sequence:
1. The **Archive Manager** requests file format information from the **DMPTool**.
2. **DMPTool** queries its **Database** for the file format details related to the specific datasets in question.
3. The **Database** returns the requested file format information back to the **DMPTool**.
4. **DMPTool** then provides this file format data to the **Archive Manager**.
5. Using this information, the **Archive Manager** triggers file validation through the **Validation Service**.
6. Finally, the **Validation Service** processes the file validation checks and returns the results to the **Archive Manager**.

The notation and elements used in the diagram are typical for UML sequence diagrams, allowing software developers and architects to understand the flow and interactions for this specific functionality within DMPTool. To illustrate this process directly, ensure you have access to a tool or platform that supports PlantUML syntax to render this sequence diagram visually.

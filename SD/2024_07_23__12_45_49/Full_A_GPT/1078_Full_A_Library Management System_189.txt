Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a library worker, I want to list current subscribers" involves outlining the interactions between the library worker (assumed to be either a librarian or a staff member with the appropriate access privileges) and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to retrieve and display a list of current library subscribers. Below is a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML format to illustrate these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryWorker as LW
participant WebInterface as WI
participant ApplicationServer as AS
participant Database as DB

LW -> WI: Access subscriber management section
activate WI

WI -> AS: Request to list subscribers
activate AS

AS -> DB: Query current subscribers
activate DB

DB --> AS: Return subscriber data
deactivate DB

AS --> WI: Display current subscribers
deactivate AS

WI --> LW: Show list of subscribers
deactivate WI
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes the following flow:

1. The library worker accesses the subscriber management section through the web interface of the CLMS.
2. The web interface forwards the request to list all current subscribers to the application server.
3. The application server sends a query to the database to retrieve the data of all current subscribers.
4. The database processes the query and returns the data of the subscribers to the application server.
5. The application server then sends this data back to the web interface.
6. Finally, the web interface displays the list of current subscribers to the library worker.

This diagram is simplified and conceptual. Actual implementations may involve more detailed steps, error handling, authentication and authorization checks, and possibly interactions with other components or services depending on the specific requirements and architecture of the CLMS.

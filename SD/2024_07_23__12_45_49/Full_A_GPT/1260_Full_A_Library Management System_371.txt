Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a student, I want to see the list of authors so that I can borrow a book from a specific author" involves illustrating the interaction between the student (user), the front-end interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the back-end server, and the database. The diagram will show the steps that happen from when a student decides to view the list of authors to when they receive the list on their screen.

Here is the PlantUML code to represent the above-described process:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
participant Student as student
participant "Frontend Interface" as frontend
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as database

student -> frontend : Request to see authors list
frontend -> server : GET /authors
server -> database : SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books
database --> server : List of Authors
server --> frontend : Respond with Authors List
frontend --> student : Display Authors List

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the student requesting to see the list of authors through the CLMS's front-end interface. The front-end then sends a GET request to the backend server to fetch the authors. The server, upon receiving this request, queries the database to select distinct authors from the books table. The database responds with the list of authors, which the server passes back to the front-end interface. Finally, the front-end interface displays the list of authors to the student.

Please note that this PlantUML code focuses on a high-level representation. Detailed technical integrations, error handling, and security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, authorization) are not represented in this sequence but should be considered in a real-world implementation.

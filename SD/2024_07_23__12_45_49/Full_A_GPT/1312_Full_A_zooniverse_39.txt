To visually map out the user story of a Zooniverse admin performing automatic preclassification of plankton species in Plankton Portal images using PlantUML, you will need to set up a sequence of interactions between different system components involved in this process. Below is a detailed PlantUML code to illustrate this sequence.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Zooniverse Admin" as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Media Identification \n& Discovery Platform" as AMIDP
participant "AI Classification Engine" as AIengine
participant "Plankton Image Database" as database
participant "Result Presenter" as presenter

admin -> dashboard : Initiates Preclassification
dashboard -> AMIDP : Requests Plankton Image Batch
AMIDP -> database : Fetches Unprocessed Images
database --> AMIDP : Returns Images
AMIDP -> AIengine : Sends Images for Classification
note right of AIengine: AI Engine analyzes images \nusing Machine Learning models
AIengine -> database : Stores Preliminary Classification Results
database --> AMIDP : Confirms Storage
AMIDP -> presenter : Prepares Classification Summary
presenter --> dashboard : Displays Summary
dashboard --> admin : Shows Preclassification Results

note over admin, presenter: Admin reviews \npreclassification results

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Zooniverse Admin Initiates Preclassification:** The sequence begins with a Zooniverse admin initiating the process of preclassifying plankton species from within the admin dashboard.

2. **Request for Plankton Image Batch:** The admin dashboard sends a request to the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) to fetch a batch of plankton images that haven't been processed yet.

3. **Fetching Unprocessed Images:** AMIDP retrieves unprocessed plankton images from the Plankton Image Database.

4. **Sending Images for Classification:** The images are then forwarded to the AI Classification Engine. This step leverages AI and machine learning to analyze and classify the images based on different plankton species.

5. **Storing Preliminary Classification Results:** Once the images have been classified, the AI Classification Engine stores the preliminary results in the Plankton Image Database.

6. **Confirmation of Storage and Summary Preparation:** The database confirms the storage of classification results. Subsequently, AMIDP prepares a summary of the classification results.

7. **Displaying Summary to Admin:** The classification summary is displayed to the Zooniverse admin through the admin dashboard.

8. **Review by Admin:** The Zooniverse admin reviews the preclassification results, potentially making adjustments or confirming the AI's assessments for further processing or analysis.

This diagram and sequence provide a high-level overview of the interactions and processes involved when a Zooniverse admin wants to perform automatic preclassification of plankton species in Plankon Portal images, showcasing the collaborative efforts of different components within the system to achieve this task efficiently.

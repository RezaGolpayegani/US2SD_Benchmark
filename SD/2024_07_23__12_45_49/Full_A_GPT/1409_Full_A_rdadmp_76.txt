Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves visualizing the interactions between different actors (like the faculty data steward) and the system components within the DMPTool project. To provide an accurate and helpful sequence diagram, it should include the steps the faculty data steward takes to view the sections on costing within the DMPTool, and how the system responds at each step. 

Given the constraints of text-based descriptions, the following is a PlantUML script which outlines these interactions in a sequence diagram format. This script assumes that the DMPTool has a login feature, a dashboard, and provides access to different modules including the costing section.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Faculty Data Steward" as steward
participant "DMPTool Interface" as interface
database "Project Data" as projectData
participant "Costing Module" as costing

== Accessing the Costing Section ==
steward -> interface : Access DMPTool
interface -> steward : Display Dashboard

steward -> interface : Navigate to Costing Section
interface -> costing : Request Costing Data
costing -> projectData : Fetch Costing Information
projectData -> costing : Return Costing Data
costing -> interface : Display Costing Information
interface -> steward : Show Costing Section

== Interaction with Costing Section ==
steward -> interface : Modify/Review Costing Details
interface -> costing : Update Request
costing -> projectdata : Modify Costing Info
projectData -> costing : Confirm Update
costing -> interface : Update Confirmation
interface -> steward : Display Update Confirmation

### How to Run This PlantUML Script
1. **PlantUML Plugin**: If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, or others that support PlantUML, you can simply paste this script into a new PlantUML file and use the plugin to generate the diagram.
2. **Online Editors**: There are several online PlantUML editors available, such as PlantText (https://www.planttext.com/) or PlantUML QEditor. These tools allow you to paste the script and render the diagram directly on the webpage.
3. **Local PlantUML Setup**: If you have PlantUML set up locally and a Graphviz installation (for diagram rendering), you can save this script to a file (e.g., `DMPTool_SequenceDiagram.plantuml`) and generate the diagram using a command line instruction like `java -jar plantuml.jar DMPTool_SequenceDiagram.plantuml`.

### Notes
- The interactions included in the script are a high-level overview. Details such as authentication, error handling, and fine-grained interactions within the "Costing Module" (like calculating specific fees or showing tips for cost optimization) are omitted for brevity.
- Depending on the actual implementation details and scope of the DMPTool project, you might need to tailor the interactions and components to fit the real-world use cases more precisely.
- Sequence diagrams are great for illustrating specific interactions and flows but consider creating complementary UML diagrams (e.g., class diagrams, activity diagrams) for a full architectural overview.

This script is a starting point; please adjust according to your project's unique requirements and features.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story using PlantUML requires the clarification of a few roles, interactions, and components involved in the process of configuring the help center URL and topic mappings by an Application Administrator. Below is a simple example of how such a process might be depicted:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Application Administrator" as AA
participant "Configuration Interface" as CI
participant "System Backend" as SB
participant "Database" as DB

AA -> CI: Access Configuration Module
activate CI

CI -> SB: Request Current Help Center Settings
activate SB

SB -> DB: Fetch Help Center Settings
activate DB

DB --> SB: Return Settings
deactivate DB

SB --> CI: Display Current Settings
deactivate SB

AA -> CI: Enter New Help Center URL and Topic Mappings
activate CI

CI -> SB: Update Help Center Settings
activate SB

SB -> DB: Store New Settings
activate DB

DB --> SB: Confirm Update
deactivate DB

SB --> CI: Update Confirmation Message
deactivate SB

CI --> AA: Display Success Message
deactivate CI

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram starts with the Application Administrator accessing the Configuration Interface to change the help center URL and topic mappings. The Configuration Interface requests the current settings from the System Backend, which, in turn, fetches them from the Database. Once the current settings are displayed, and the administrator inputs the new settings, the System Backend updates these in the Database. After a confirmation of the update is received, a success message is displayed to the administrator.

Please adjust roles, components, and interactions as necessary to fit the specific technologies, workflows, and architecture of your project.

Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram representation based on the provided user story for a Data Manager who wants to know which formats are used to understand what technology or background information might be necessary to use the data. Note that due to the conversational platform's limitations, some specifics and assumptions are made for a more illustrative diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager as DM
participant "DMPTool Interface" as UI
participant "Metadata Management System" as MMS
participant "Data Format Repository" as DFR
participant "Technology Info System" as TIS
database "Data Formats Database" as DFD

DM -> UI: Request data format info
activate UI

UI -> MMS: Retrieve associated metadata
activate MMS

MMS -> DFR: Request specific data format details
activate DFR

DFR -> DFD: Fetch data formats
activate DFD

DFD --> DFR : Return data formats
deactivate DFD

DFR --> MMS : Provide data format details
deactivate DFR

MMS --> UI: Send metadata including formats
deactivate MMS

UI -> TIS: Request technology/background info
activate TIS

TIS -> DFD: Query for technology requirements
activate DFD

DFD --> TIS : Respond with tech requirements
deactivate DFD

TIS --> UI : Send tech/background info
deactivate TIS

UI --> DM : Display data format and tech info
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram outlines the following process:

1. The Data Manager (DM) requests information on data formats through the DMPTool Interface.
2. The DMPTool Interface queries the Metadata Management System (MMS) for associated metadata.
3. The Metadata Management System requests specific data format details from the Data Format Repository.
4. The Data Format Repository fetches the required data formats from the Data Formats Database.
5. Upon retrieving the data formats, the DFR sends this information back to the MMS, which in turn sends it to the interface.
6. The DMPTool Interface then requests necessary technology or background information from the Technology Info System (TIS) required to use the data in the questioned formats.
7. The Technology Info System queries the same or a related database to find out what technology or background information is associated with the given data formats.
8. The TIS provides the requested technology and background information to the DMPTool Interface.
9. Finally, the DMPTool Interface displays the data format and associated technology or background information to the Data Manager.

The diagram assumes that the DMPTool has access to a Metadata Management System and a Data Format Repository, either internally or through integrations, and that there's a database or system (Technology Info System) capable of providing the required technology or background information related to specific data formats.

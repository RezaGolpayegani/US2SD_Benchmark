Given the specific request for a sequence diagram in PlantUML format regarding the user story of NSF employee viewing the user recruitment form, here's how it might look. Please note that this representation simplifies the process into key interactions to fit within the specifics of the user story provided:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant NSF_Employee as Employee
participant WebBrowser as Browser
participant CloudServer as Server
participant CMS as "Content Management System"
participant DataBase as DB

Employee -> Browser: Navigate to beta.nsf.gov/sample
Browser -> Server: Request /sample page
Server -> CMS: Fetch content for /sample
CMS -> DB: Query user recruitment form details
DB --> CMS: Return form details
CMS --> Server: Provide complete sample page with form
Server --> Browser: Return sample page HTML
Browser -> Employee: Display sample page with user recruitment form

note over Employee,Browser: Employee reviews form layout\nand functionality

Employee -> Browser: Interact with form (View, Fill, Submit)
Browser -> Server: Submit form data for preview
Server -> CMS: Process form data
CMS -> Server: Return form submission confirmation
Server -> Browser: Display confirmation message
Browser -> Employee: Show confirmation of form action

This diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions between an NSF employee (as the actor), their web browser, the server hosting the NSF beta site, the content management system (CMS), and the database (DB) when the employee wants to view and interact with the user recruitment form on a sample page of the site. Starting from the employee's action to navigate to the designated page and concluding with the employee receiving a confirmation of form action (e.g., viewing, filling, and/or submitting the form for preview), the sequence encapsulates the critical steps in rendering the form and processing initial interaction with it. 

Keep in mind, this representation is tailored to the given user story and simplifies the underlying technical details and potential interactions for clarity and focus on the user recruitment form aspect.

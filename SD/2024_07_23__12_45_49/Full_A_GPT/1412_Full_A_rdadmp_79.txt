Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story would require outlining the interactions between the data manager and other components of the DMPTool to clarify necessary rights for re-using the data. Below is an illustrative attempt to capture these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataManager as "Data Manager"
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "Metadata Repository" as Metadata
participant "Legal & Compliance Module" as LegalModule
participant "External Metadata Tools" as ExternalTools
participant "Institutional Systems" as InstitutionalSystems
database "Rights Repository" as RightsRepo

== Clarify Re-use Rights Sequence ==

DataManager -> Interface : request re-use rights information
Interface -> Metadata : query data project metadata
Metadata --> Interface : return metadata details
Interface -> LegalModule : request legal compliance check
LegalModule -> RightsRepo : check rights and compliance rules
RightsRepo --> LegalModule : provide rights information
LegalModule -> ExternalTools : verify rights with external sources
ExternalTools --> LegalModule : confirm external rights statuses
LegalModule --> Interface : provide comprehensive rights information
Interface -> InstitutionalSystems : cross-reference institutional policies
InstitutionalSystems --> Interface : provide institutional policy constraints
Interface --> DataManager : display rights and compliance information
DataManager -> Interface : confirm understanding/acceptance of rights
Interface -> Metadata : log rights clarification action

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram's Steps:
1. **Data Manager requests re-use rights information:** This is the initiation point where the data manager interacts with the DMPTool interface to clarify the necessary rights for re-using the data.
2. **DMPTool Interface queries the project’s metadata:** The interface retrieves the specific data’s metadata to understand the context and details of the data in question.
3. **Legal & Compliance Module requests a legal compliance check:** This module is responsible for verifying the data against legal standards and compliance requirements.
4. **Checking rights in the Rights Repository:** Here, the tool checks internal repositories for pre-existing rights information and compliance rules related to the data.
5. **Verification with external metadata tools:** To ensure comprehensive rights clarification, the tool also checks external metadata sources for any additional rights information or constraints.
6. **Cross-referencing with Institutional Policies:** The tool cross-references the gathered information with institutional policies, which might have additional constraints or permissions.
7. **Display comprehensive rights and compliance information to the Data Manager:** All the gathered and verified information is then presented to the data manager through the DMPTool interface.
8. **Data Manager confirms understanding or acceptance of rights:** The final action involves the data manager acknowledging the rights status, which is then logged in the project's metadata.

This sequence ensures a comprehensive approach to clarifying data re-use rights, involving checks across internal and external sources, and considering institutional policies, thereby aiding the data manager in legal and compliant data handling.

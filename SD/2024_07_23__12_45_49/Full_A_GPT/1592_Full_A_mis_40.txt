Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story involves displaying the processes involved from the point a repository manager requests to view deduplicated recent errors, through to the backend processes, and finally the display of the information. Given the complexity and the multiple systems involved (e.g., the digital repository system and integration with external systems like Symplectic Elements), here's a simplified approach in PlantUML syntax.

Please note, the following UML diagram is a high-level representation and may need adjustments based on the specifics of your system architecture, programming language, and database structure.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as manager
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Controller" as controller
participant "Error Processing Module" as processor
participant "Database" as db
participant "External System\n(Symplectic Elements)" as external

manager -> web : Request recent errors view
web -> controller : Invoke view errors method
controller -> processor : Fetch deduplicated errors
processor -> db : Query recent errors
db -> processor : Return errors list
processor -> external : Request deduplication method
external -> processor : Return deduplicated errors
processor -> controller : Processed errors list
controller -> web : Display errors to manager
web -> manager : Show deduplicated recent errors

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:
1. The repository manager initiates a request to view recent errors through the web interface.
2. The web interface relays this request to a controller within the server.
3. The controller communicates with an Error Processing Module designed to handle error fetching and processing.
4. The Error Processing Module requests a list of recent errors from the database.
5. The database returns the list of recent errors to the Error Processing Module.
6. The Error Processing Module then interacts with an external system, like Symplectic Elements, to apply a deduplication methodology to the errors.
7. The external system returns the deduplicated errors to the Error Processing Module.
8. The Error Processing Module sends the processed list of deduplicated errors back to the controller.
9. The controller instructs the web interface to display the errors.
10. Finally, the web interface presents the deduplicated recent errors to the repository manager.

This diagram assumes integration with an external system for the error deduplication feature. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the actual implementation details, such as direct deduplication algorithms within the repository system or specific interactions with external systems.

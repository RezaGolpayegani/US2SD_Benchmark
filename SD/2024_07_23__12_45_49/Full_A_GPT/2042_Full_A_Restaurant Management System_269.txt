Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a system developer, I want to know where inventory information is stored in the database" entails illustrating the interaction between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System to retrieve inventory information. Since explicit interactions for this operation haven't been provided, I'll design a generic flow that fits the described system architecture and project functionality.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant BusinessLogic as BL
participant DatabaseAPI as DBAPI
database InventoryDB as DB

UI -> BL : Request inventory location details
activate BL

BL -> DBAPI : Query inventory information storage
activate DBAPI

DBAPI -> DB : SELECT inventory_storage_details 
activate DB
DB --> DBAPI : Return storage details
deactivate DB

DBAPI --> BL : Storage details data
deactivate DBAPI

BL --> UI : Show inventory storage information
deactivate BL

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **UserInterface (UI)**: This represents the front end where a system developer might interact to request information about where inventory data is stored. Though typically used by restaurant staff or customers, in this scenario, imagine a special interface for developers or a command in the backend system.
2. **BusinessLogic (BL)**: Acts as the middleware or the server-side logic, processing the request from the UI. It understands what information is being requested and knows how to retrieve it.
3. **DatabaseAPI (DBAPI)**: A layer abstracting direct database interactions. It receives commands from the business logic layer, translates them into database queries, and communicates with the actual database. This helps in encapsulating the database logic and makes the system more modular.
4. **InventoryDB (DB)**: The database where inventory details are stored. It's queried by the DatabaseAPI and returns the location or structure showing where inventory information resides.

In this sequence, when a system developer (through a UI designed for system management or a direct code query) requests to know where inventory information is stored, the request is processed through the system's back-end logic, querying the database through an API layer, and finally accessing the database to retrieve the necessary information. This diagram simplifies interaction flows and can vary significantly in a real-world scenario with additional layers, such as authentication, error handling, and data formatting, being involved.

For actual implementation, specifics like database table names, fields representing "inventory_storage_details," and the format of the returned data would need to be defined based on the project's database schema.

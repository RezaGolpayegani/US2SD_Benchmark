Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves depicting the interaction between the library visitor and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), particularly focusing on checking an author's status (dead or alive). Given the scope of PlantUML, a concise representation of this process will be provided.

Consider this sequence of actions: A library visitor uses CLMS to find information about an author. The system checks the author's details in the database and returns the status (dead or alive) to the visitor.

Here's how this scenario can be represented in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Visitor as "Library Visitor"
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Author Info Module" as AuthorInfo
database "CLMS Database" as Database

Visitor -> Interface: Search for author info
Interface -> AuthorInfo: Request author status
AuthorForensic -> Database: Lookup author details
Database --> AuthorForensic: Return author details
AuthorInfo --> Interface: Author status (dead or alive)
Interface --> Visitor: Show author status

@enduml
```

This diagram simplifies the process into primary steps:

1. The **Library Visitor** interacts with the **CLMS Interface** by searching for information about an author.
2. The **CLMS Interface** forwards this request to an **Author Info Module**, specifically designed to handle author-related queries.
3. The **Author Info Module** queries the **CLMS Database** to retrieve the author's details, particularly focusing on the author's life status.
4. The **CLMS Database** returns the requested information to the **Author Info Module**.
5. The **Author Info Module** then communicates the author's status back to the **CLMS Interface**.
6. Finally, the **CLMS Interface** displays the status to the **Library Visitor**, completing the interaction.

This sequence diagram outlines the basic interactions involved in fulfilling the visitor's request regarding an author's status. It does not detail every possible technical nuance or handling error cases (e.g., author not found), focusing instead on a straightforward interaction flow for clarity and conciseness.

Creating a Sequence Diagram for linking datasets to publications in Opus involves illustrating the interactions between the depositor, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, and the Opus system according to your project's functionalities. Below is a basic representation in PlantUML syntax to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor
participant "Enhanced Research\nData Management Platform" as Platform
participant Opus
participant DOI_Service

== Link Datasets to Publications ==

Depositor -> Platform: Select dataset for linking

alt if dataset not already deposited
    Depositor -> Platform: Deposits dataset 
    Platform -> DOI_Service: Request DOI for dataset
    DOI_Service -> Platform: DOI
    Platform -> Depositor: Confirm dataset deposited\nand DOI assigned
end

Depositor -> Platform: Input publication details (e.g., title, author)

Platform -> Opus: Search for publication by details
Opus -> Platform: Return publication match

alt if publication found
    Platform -> Depositor: Display publication(s) found
    Depositor -> Platform: Confirm publication to link
    Platform -> Opus: Link dataset DOI to publication
    Opus -> Platform: Confirm linkage
    Platform -> Depositor: Confirm dataset linked to publication
else
    Platform -> Depositor: No publication match found\nSuggest manual entry
    Depositor -> Platform: Provides manual publication details
    Platform -> Opus: Create new publication entry with dataset DOI link
    Opus -> Platform: Confirm new publication created and linked
    Platform -> Depositor: Confirm dataset linked to new publication
end

This sequence diagram outlines the basic interaction flow for a depositor wishing to link datasets to publications in Opus via the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. The steps include the depositor selecting and potentially depositing a dataset, searching for the publication in Opus, and either linking the dataset to an existing publication or creating a new publication entry if no match is found. DOI assignment is also included as a step, as it is crucial for linking datasets to publications in a way that enables easy discovery and citation. 

It's important to note, this is a basic visualization; depending on the specifics of how datasets are linked to publications in Opus (e.g., metadata requirements, authentication protocols), further details and steps might be necessary. Also, administrative actions or error-handling routines (such as failure to find a publication, or duplicate DOIs) are simplified or omitted for clarity.

Given your requirement, let's break down the user story "As a Practitioner, I want to include additional details about me in my profile page, so that I can showcase my experience." into a sequence diagram using PlantUML. This sequence diagram will illustrate the sequence of interactions between the practitioner (user), the frontend (UI - User Interface), the backend (server), and the database for the action of updating and showcasing additional details on the practitioner's profile page.

Please note, the level of detail and specific components might vary based on your actual system architecture, but the following offers a general approach:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Practitioner as user
participant "UI: Profile Page" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
database "Profile Database" as db

user -> ui : Navigate to profile settings
ui -> server : Request current profile data
server -> db : Query current profile details
db -> server : Return current profile details
server -> ui : Display profile details
ui -> user : Show profile settings form

user -> ui : Enter additional details
ui -> server : Submit updated profile details
server -> db : Update profile details in the database
db -> server : Confirm update success

alt Success
    server -> ui : Display success message
    ui -> user : Show success notification
else Failure
    server -> ui : Display error message
    ui -> user : Show error notification
end

user -> ui : View updated profile
ui -> server : Request updated profile page
server -> db : Query updated profile details
db -> server : Return updated profile details
server -> ui : Display updated profile page
ui -> user : Show updated profile with new details

This PlantUML sequence diagram represents a simplified flow for a practitioner wishing to update their profile with additional details. The practitioner interacts with the UI to edit and submit their profile details. The frontend communicates these changes to the backend server, which then updates the information in the profile database. Upon success or failure, the server responds to the frontend, which then notifies the user of the outcome. Finally, the practitioner views their updated profile, showcasing their experience and additional details.

Remember, the actual implementation can vary based on your specific project architecture, requirements, and technologies used. This diagram can be modified and expanded based on the project's complexity and additional features.

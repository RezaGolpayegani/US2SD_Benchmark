To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story: "As a manager, I want to see all books available so that I can request new books if necessary," using PlantUML, follow the syntax below. This scenario assumes that the library manager accesses the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) through a web interface, queries the system for a list of all available books, and the system fetches and displays this information from its database.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as manager
participant "Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "CLMS Backend" as backend
database "CLMS Database" as database

manager -> webInterface : Access Library Management System
webInterface -> backend : Request list of available books
backend -> database : Query available books
database --> backend : Return list of available books
backend --> webInterface : Show list of available books
webInterface --> manager : Display available books

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process flow from the perspective of a library manager looking to view all available books in the library's collection. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. The Manager accesses the Library Management System through its Web Interface.
2. The Web Interface sends a request to the CLMS Backend to fetch a list of all available books.
3. The CLMS Backend then queries the CLMS Database for the list of available books.
4. The Database returns the list of available books to the CLMS Backend.
5. The CLMS Backend processes this list and sends it back to the Web Interface.
6. Finally, the Web Interface displays this list to the Manager, who can review the available titles to decide whether new book requests are necessary.

This approach ensures that the manager has real-time access to the library's inventory, which aids in making informed decisions about extending the book collection based on current availability and demand.

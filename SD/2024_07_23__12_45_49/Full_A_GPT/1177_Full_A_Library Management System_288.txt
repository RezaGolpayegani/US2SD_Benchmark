Creating a sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a member, I want to see daily newspapers" in a Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) involves outlining the interactions between different system components and the member end user when they wish to access daily newspapers.

Below is a basic outline of the PlantUML code to model the interaction for accessing daily newspapers within the system. This starts with the member's action to request newspapers and ends with them viewing the newspaper listings.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as member
participant WebInterface as web
participant AuthenticationSystem as auth
participant NewspaperService as service
participant Database as db

member -> web : Access CLMS to view newspapers
web -> auth : Validate Member Session
activate auth
auth -->> web : Session Valid
deactivate auth
web -> service : Request Daily Newspapers
activate service
service -> db : Query Available Newspapers
activate db
db -->> service : Return Newspaper Listings
deactivate db
service -->> web : Display Newspapers
deactivate service
web -> member : Show Daily Newspapers Listing
@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Member -> WebInterface:** The member accesses the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) web interface, indicating an intention to view daily newspapers.

2. **WebInterface -> AuthenticationSystem:** The web interface requests session validation for the member from the authentication system to ensure the member is logged in.

3. **AuthenticationSystem -> WebInterface:** The authentication system responds back after validating the session, confirming that the member is authenticated.

4. **WebInterface -> NewspaperService:** Once the session validation is confirmed, the web interface asks the newspaper service for the list of daily newspapers available.

5. **NewspaperService -> Database:** The newspaper service, to fulfill this request, queries the database for the listings of available daily newspapers.

6. **Database -> NewspaperService:** The database responds with the details of daily newspapers that are currently accessible.

7. **NewspaperService -> WebInterface:** The newspaper service provides the web interface with the information gathered from the database.

8. **WebInterface -> Member:** Finally, the web interface displays the listing of daily newspapers to the member.

This sequence diagram illustrates the series of interactions underlying a simple user story in a specific system scenario. Keep in mind, for real-world applications, additional steps such as error handling, logging, and performance metrics collection might also be integrated into the sequence.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story, "As a Principal Investigator (PI), I want to properly record all metadata so that I can ensure the proper running of the project in case of staff changes," involves illustrating the interactions between the PI, the DMPTool, and potentially other systems or stakeholders involved in the process of recording metadata. This sequence will capture the steps right from the initial login to the final confirmation of recorded metadata.

Given the complexity and the wide range of features of the DMPTool as described in the project overview, the following is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram that captures the essence of the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor PI
participant "DMPTool Interface" as Interface
participant "Metadata Recording Module" as MetadataModule
participant "Institutional System" as InstitutionalSys
participant "External Metadata Tools" as ExternalTools
participant "Data Repository" as Repository

== Metadata Recording Process ==
PI -> Interface : Login
activate Interface
Interface -> MetadataModule : Initiate Metadata Recording
activate MetadataModule
MetadataModule -> InstitutionalSys : Fetch PI Project Information
activate InstitutionalSys
InstitutionalSys --> MetadataModule : Return Project Info
deactivate InstitutionalSys
MetadataModule -> ExternalTools : Import Existing Metadata
activate ExternalTools
ExternalTools --> MetadataModule : Return Imported Metadata
deactivate ExternalTools
MetadataModule -> MetadataModule : Merge Metadata
PI -> MetadataModule : Enter/Update Metadata
MetadataModule -> Repository : Verify Data Provenance
activate Repository
Repository --> MetadataModule : Provenance OK
deactivate Repository
MetadataModule --> Interface : Display Metadata Summary
PI -> Interface : Submit Metadata
Interface -> MetadataModule : Confirm Metadata Recording
MetadataModule -> MetadataModule : Generate Metadata ID/Record
MetadataModule --> PI : Confirm Metadata Recorded
deactivate MetadataModule
deactivate Interface

### Explanation:
- **PI**: The Principal Investigator initiates the process by logging into the DMPTool Interface.
- **DMPTool Interface**: Serves as the primary interaction point for the PI to start the metadata recording process.
- **Metadata Recording Module**: This module facilitates the main functionalities related to capturing, merging, and validating metadata.
- **Institutional System**: Might be used to fetch existing project information related to the PI to avoid redundancy and ensure accuracy.
- **External Metadata Tools**: Represents any external systems from which existing metadata could be imported to enrich or complement the current project metadata.
- **Data Repository**: Engaged to verify data provenance as part of ensuring the integrity and compliance of the recorded metadata.
- **Process Flow**: The sequence starts with the PI logging in and progresses through initiating metadata recording, fetching, and importing existing data, merging metadata, validating data provenance, and finally, confirming the recording of metadata.

This diagram represents a high-level interaction overview. Depending on the project requirements and technical specifics, more detailed interactions or steps might need to be added, such as handling errors, more intricate data validation processes, or detailed interactions between systems for metadata import and verification.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on the provided project description involves visualizing the interactions between various objects when a manager stores orders to calculate total sales. Given the possible complexity of a restaurant management system, this sequence diagram focuses on a simplified flow for clarity and understanding. The sequence includes initiating the order storage process, interacting with the database, and calculating the sales totals.

Please note, the depiction is simplified and may not cover all exceptional flows or error handling for brevity and clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as M
participant FrontendApplication as FA
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

title Store Orders and Calculate Total Sales

M -> FA : Store order details
FA -> BS : Request to store order
activate BS
BS -> DB : Save order data
activate DB
DB --> BS : Acknowledge data saved
deactivate DB

BS -> DB : Query orders for sales calculation
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return orders data
deactivate DB

BS -> BS : Calculate total sales
BS --> FA : Send total sales data
deactivate BS
FA --> M : Display total sales

### Explanation:
1. **Manager (M)**: Initiates the order storage process by interacting with the **Frontend Application (FA)**, like a web interface or a management dashboard.
2. **Frontend Application (FA)**: Receives the manager's request and forwards it to the **Backend Server (BS)** for processing.
3. **Backend Server (BS)**: Handles the request by performing two primary tasks--storing order data and calculating total sales. It communicates with the **Database (DB)** for both saving the received order data and retrieving it later for sales calculations.
4. **Database (DB)**: Stores order details when requested and provides stored data back to the Backend Server upon request for total sales calculations.
5. After calculating the total sales, the Backend Server sends this information back through the chain to the Frontend Application, which then presents the calculated total sales to the Manager.

This simplified sequence diagram aims to visualize the process flow based on the project description's requirements. It's important to note that real-world implementations may involve additional steps or processes, like authentication and authorization, error handling, and data validation, to ensure the system's security, reliability, and accuracy.

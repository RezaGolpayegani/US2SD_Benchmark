To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a user, I want to contact the administrators, so that I can give feedback or ask for help," we need to outline the main steps involved in this process.

1. The user accesses the feedback or help section on the RecycleSmart platform.
2. The user fills out a form with their feedback or request for help.
3. The information is submitted to the platform's server.
4. The server processes the request and forwards it to the relevant administrator's inbox or dashboard, possibly through an internal messaging system or via email.
5. The administrator receives the notification and reviews the feedback or help request.
6. The administrator responds directly to the user through the platform's messaging system or via email.

Below is an example of how this could be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor User
participant "Feedback Form" as Form
participant "RecycleSmart Server" as Server
database "Admin Dashboard" as Dashboard
actor Administrator

User -> Form : Access feedback/help section
User -> Form : Fills out and submits form
Form -> Server : Submit feedback/help request
activate Server
Server -> Dashboard : Forward request to admin
activate Dashboard
note right of Dashboard : Admin reviews request\nand prepares response
Dashboard -> Administrator : Notify new feedback/help request
Administrator -> Dashboard : Review request
Administrator -> Server : Prepares and sends response
Server -> User : Display admin response
deactivate Server
deactivate Dashboard

This sequence diagram covers the basic process flow from the user's perspective of wanting to contact administrators for feedback or help, through the platform's internal processes, to the administrator receiving and responding to the request. Note that specific implementation details (like authentication processes or the content of the feedback form) are omitted for clarity and breach considerations. Also, the response from the administrator to the user goes back through the server, which might handle formatting the response or choosing the appropriate communication channel based on user preferences or settings.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story mentioned using PlantUML, please see the detailed example below. This example assumes the existence of several system components such as a User Interface (UI) for administrators, a Backend System that manages requests, a Statistics Module to handle and process statistics, a Database to store and retrieve data, and a Report Generation Service to create the reports. 

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you will need to use a PlantUML editor or an online PlantUML tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "Admin UI" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend
participant "Statistics Module" as stats
database "Database" as db
participant "Report Generation Service" as reportGen

admin -> ui : Requests statistics
ui -> backend : Fetch statistics
backend -> stats : Retrieve comprehensive stats
stats -> db : Query faculty work data
db -> stats : Return data
stats -> backend : Process data into statistics
backend -> reportGen : Generate digestible report
reportGen -> backend : Return generated report
backend -> ui : Display report
ui -> admin : Show comprehensive tracking statistics

```

### Explanation of Steps:
1. **Administrator Requests Statistics:** The administrator initiates the process by requesting to view comprehensive tracking statistics through the Admin UI.
2. **Fetch Statistics:** The Admin UI sends a request to the Backend System to fetch the required statistics.
3. **Retrieve Comprehensive Stats:** The Backend System forwards this request to the Statistics Module, which is responsible for retrieving and processing the statistics.
4. **Query Faculty Work Data:** The Statistics Module queries the Database for the necessary data related to faculty work, including published papers, datasets, etc.
5. **Return Data:** The Database returns the queried data back to the Statistics Module.
6. **Process Data Into Statistics:** Upon receiving the data, the Statistics Module processes it to compile the comprehensive tracking statistics.
7. **Generate Digestible Report:** The processed statistics are then sent to the Report Generation Service by the Backend System to generate a digestible report suitable for presentation to faculty.
8. **Return Generated Report:** The Report Generation Service creates the report and returns it to the Backend System.
9. **Display Report:** The Backend System then sends the report back to the Admin UI.
10. **Show Comprehensive Tracking Statistics:** Finally, the Admin UI displays the comprehensive tracking statistics report to the administrator, completing the sequence.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions between different components of the system in response to the administrator's request to view comprehensive tracking statistics for presenting to faculty.

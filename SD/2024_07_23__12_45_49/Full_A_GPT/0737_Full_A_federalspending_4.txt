Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for your user story involves mapping out the interactions between the UI designer, the system components, and possibly other stakeholders involved in moving on to and completing the second round of edits and obtaining approval from leadership for the DABS or FABS landing pages.

Since the PlantUML code can't capture every nuanced detail of your project without further specifics, the following script provides a simplified version of the sequences that such a process might involve. It includes sequences of editing, reviewing, and approving design changes.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UI_Designer as Designer
participant "Design System" as System
participant "Review Board" as Review
participant Leadership

Designer -> System : Initiate round 2 edits
alt DABS Landing Page
    Designer -> System : Apply edits to DABS
else FABS Landing Page
    Designer -> System : Apply edits to FABS
end
System -> Review : Submit for review
Review -> Review : Review edits
alt Feedback Provided
    Review -> Designer : Provide feedback
    Designer -> System : Apply feedback changes
    System -> Review : Resubmit for review
    Review -> Review : Final review
    Review -> Leadership : Submit for approval
else Approved
    Review -> Leadership : Submit for approval
end
Leadership -> Leadership : Assess edits
alt Approved
    Leadership -> Designer : Approve edits
else Revision Needed
    Leadership -> Designer : Request further changes
    Designer -> System : Apply requested changes
    System -> Review : Resubmit for review
    [...]
end

This sequence diagram starts with the UI Designer initiating the second round of edits on the design system for either the DABS or FABS landing page. The process follows through the review board's evaluation, potential feedback loops, the final review, submission to leadership, and concludes with leadership's approval or request for further changes.

The diagram represents a general workflow and should be adapted to fit the specific processes, decision points, and systems of your project. For a more detailed diagram, information about specific systems involved, approval criteria, and detailed steps for handling feedback would be needed.

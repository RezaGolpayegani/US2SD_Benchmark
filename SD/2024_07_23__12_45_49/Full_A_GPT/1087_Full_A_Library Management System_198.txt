Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a manager, I want to see the employee information," in PlantUML format, involves depicting the interaction between different objects (like the Manager, User Interface, Server, Database) to achieve the goal of viewing employee information within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Please note this simplified representation doesn't cover all possible error handling and security features that should be considered in a fully implemented system for security and privacy concerns.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "UI (User Interface)" as UI
participant "Server" as S
participant "Database" as D

M -> UI : Request to view employee information
UI -> S : API call to get employee data
S -> D : Query employee information

alt If employee data is found
    D --> S : Return employee data
    S --> UI : Response with employee data
    UI --> M : Display employee information
else If no data found
    D --> S : Return "Data not found" message
    S --> UI : Response with "No data" message
    UI --> M : Show "Information not available"
end

```
This sequence diagram starts with the Manager's request to view employee information through the User Interface (UI). The UI then makes an API call to the server (S) to fetch the required data. The server, interfacing with the Database (D), queries for the employee information. The database could either return the queried employee data or a "Data not available" message, depending on whether the information is found or not. The server sends this information back to the UI, which in turn displays the employee information or a not available message to the Manager.

This representation shows a very basic interaction. Implementation complexities such as authentication & authorization, error handling, and data formatting for presentation are omitted for clarity and simplicity.

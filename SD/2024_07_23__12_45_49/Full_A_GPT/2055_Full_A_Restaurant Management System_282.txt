To visualize interactions for the user story "As a waiter, I want to deselect order items," let's focus on breaking down the steps involved into a sequence diagram using PlantUML. This diagram will encompass interactions between the system's components like the UI (User Interface), Order Management System, and the Database. Given the scope, this sequence will primarily demonstrate how a waiter interacts with the system to deselect an order item.

Please note, the following is a textual representation for a PlantUML sequence diagram and needs to be run within a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor to generate the visual diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "UI: Waiter Interface" as UI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
database "Database" as DB

== Deselect Order Item ==
Waiter -> UI: Selects order to modify
UI -> OMS: Request order details
OMS -> DB: Fetch order details
DB -> OMS: Order details
OMS -> UI: Display order with items
Waiter -> UI: Deselects items from order
UI -> OMS: Update order with deselected items
OMS -> DB: Update order in database
DB -> OMS: Confirmation of update
OMs -> UI: Confirm update to waiter
UI -> Waiter: Display confirmation message

### Explanation:
1. **Waiter interacts with UI**: The sequence begins with the waiter selecting an order to modify via the Waiter Interface (UI).

2. **Fetch Order Details**: The UI forwards the request to the Order Management System (OMS), which then queries the Database (DB) to fetch the details of the selected order.

3. **Display Order to Waiter**: Once the OMS retrieves the order details from the DB, it sends this information back to the UI, which displays the order and its items to the waiter.

4. **Deselect Items**: The waiter then deselects (or removes) certain items from the order through the UI.

5. **Update Order in the System**: The request to update the order with the deselected items is sent from the UI to the OMS, which processes this request and updates the order in the DB accordingly.

6. **Confirmation**: After the order has been successfully updated in the DB, a confirmation of the update is sent to the OMS, and then to the UI, which finally informs the waiter with a confirmation message.

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps involved in deselecting items from an order from the perspective of a waiter using the Restaurant Management and Operations System. It highlights the system's interactive and responsive design in managing order modifications efficiently.

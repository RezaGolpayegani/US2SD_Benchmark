Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to see the checks of the table" requires breaking down the interaction between various system components and the user (employee) involved in the process. Below is a Plant UML representation that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant WebInterface as WI
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

E -> WI: Access checks request
activate E
activate WI

WI -> BS: GET /tables/checks
activate BS

BS -> DB: Query checks for tables
activate DB

DB --> BS: Checks data
deactivate DB

BS --> WI: Checks information
deactivate BS

WI --> E: Display checks
deactivate WI
deactivate E

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the employee initiating an action to view the checks for tables through the web interface. The web interface then sends this request to the back-end server using a hypothetical endpoint `GET /tables/checks`. The back-end server processes this request and queries the database for the necessary checks data associated with the tables. The database returns this data back to the back-end server, which then processes and sends it back to the web interface. Finally, the web interface displays the checks to the employee.

Remember, the specifics of the request endpoints (`GET /tables/checks`) and the interaction flow might vary based on the actual implementation and design choices made during the development of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. However, this diagram provides a high-level overview of the process from the perspective of system interactions when an employee wants to see the checks for the tables.

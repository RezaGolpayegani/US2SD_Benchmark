Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the specific user story mentioned would illustrate the sequence of steps a manager might follow to view or manage employee data, including their clock-in and out information. This example focuses on a simplified version of the interaction flow, which can be further elaborated based on your specific project requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as manager
participant "Management System UI" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

== Employee Data Viewing ==
manager -> ui : Access the management dashboard
ui -> server : Request employee list with clock data
server -> db : Query employee data and clock history
db --> server : Return requested data
server --> ui : Display employee data and clock history
ui --> ResourceManager : Shows employee list and clock times

== Employee Clock In/Out Management ==
manager -> ui : Select an employee to update clock times
ui -> server : Request specific employee data
server -> db : Query for employee clock data
db --> server : Return employee clock data
server --> ui : Display employee clock data
ui --> ResourceManager : Shows detailed clock in/out times

manager -> ui : Modify clock in/out times
ui -> server : Send updated clock times
server -> db : Update clock times in the database
db --> server : Confirm update
server --> ui : Confirm update to manager
ui --> ResourceManager : Update confirmation message

This sequence diagram gives a high-level overview of how a manager interacts with the restaurant management system to manage employee data, including their clock-in and out times. It starts with the manager accessing the management dashboard and proceeds through the process of requesting and displaying employee data, selecting an employee to manage clock times, modifying those times, and receiving confirmation of the updates.

### Key Components:
- **Manager**: Initiates the process by looking to view or manage employee data.
- **Management System UI**: The user interface through which the manager interacts with the system.
- **Backend Server**: Processes requests from the UI, interacting with the database.
- **Database**: Stores all relevant data, including employee information and clock in/out times.

### Actions:
- Viewing and displaying employee data and clock history.
- Selecting an employee and modifying their clock in/out times.
- Updating the database with new times and confirming the update to the manager.

This diagram assumes that there are well-defined interfaces for querying and updating the database and that the system provides a responsive interface for the manager to interact with. Depending on the specific technologies used (e.g., MongoDB for the database, Node.js with Express for the backend), the interactions with the database might need to be adapted to match the data model and query/update mechanisms available in those technologies.

Below is a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML syntax, portraying the user story: "As a staff, I want to keep track of subscriber profiles." This diagram depicts the interaction between the library staff and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) for maintaining the subscriber profiles including operations like viewing, updating, or deleting profiles.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Staff Member" as Staff
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "CLMS Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

== Viewing a Subscriber Profile ==
Staff -> Web : select view profile
Web -> Server : request profile data
activate Server
Server -> DB : query subscriber information
activate DB
DB --> Server : return subscriber information
deactivate DB
Server --> Web : display subscriber information
Web --> Staff : show subscriber profile
deactivate Server

== Updating a Subscriber Profile ==
Staff -> Web : edit profile details
Web -> Server : update profile request
activate Server
Server -> DB : update subscriber information
activate DB
DB --> Server : confirm update
deactivate DB
Server --> Web : display updated profile
Web --> Staff : show confirmation message
deactivate Server

== Deleting a Subscriber Profile ==
Staff -> Web : request to delete profile
Web -> Server : delete profile request
activate Server
Server -> DB : remove subscriber information
activate DB
DB --> Server : confirm deletion
deactivate DB
Server --> Web : show deletion confirmation
Web --> Staff : display success message
deactivate Server

This sequence diagram illustrates three main processes: viewing, updating, and deleting subscriber profiles through interactions primarily between the staff member and the library system facilitated by a web interface. The web interface relays requests to the CLMS server, which, in turn, interacts with the database to perform the requested operations. Confirmation of the actions is sent back to the staff member via the same path in reverse. This communication ensures that staff can effectively manage subscriber profiles within the Comprehensive Library Management System, maintaining up-to-date records that are essential for efficient library management.

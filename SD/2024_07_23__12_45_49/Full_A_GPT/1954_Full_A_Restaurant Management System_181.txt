Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story, "As a manager, I want to see stored inventory information so that I can double check if we have everything on the lights.menu," involves numerous steps and interactions between different components of the system. Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Backend Server" as BS
database "Database" as DB

manager -> MI : Requests inventory information
activate MI
MI -> BS : Fetch inventory data
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query inventory
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return inventory data
deactivate DB
BS --> MI : Inventory data response
deactivate BS
MI --> manager : Display inventory information
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

### How to Read the Diagram

1. **Manager**: Initiates the process by requesting to view the inventory information through the Management Interface.
2. **Management Interface (MI)**: Acts as the front-end interface where the manager interacts with the system. It sends a request to the Backend Server to fetch the required inventory data.
3. **Backend Server (BS)**: Processes the request from the Management Interface. It is responsible for communicating with the database to retrieve the inventory information.
4. **Database (DB)**: Stores all the data related to inventory. When it receives a query from the Backend Server, it fetches the requested information and sends it back.
5. **Flow of Information**: The sequence starts with the manager's request and flows through the system, ending with the display of the inventory information back to the manager.

### Description

The system is designed to allow a manager to quickly check the current inventory status to ensure all items required for the menu are available. By interacting with the Management Interface, the manager sends a request to view the inventory data. The request is processed by the Backend Server, which then queries the Database for the required information. Once the database returns the inventory data, it is sent back through the backend to the Management Interface, where it is finally displayed to the manager.

This sequence diagram is a simplified representation focusing on the main interactions related to the user story. Depending on the complexity of the actual system, additional details such as authentication, error handling, and interactive features (like filtering or sorting the inventory information) can also be included in a more detailed design.

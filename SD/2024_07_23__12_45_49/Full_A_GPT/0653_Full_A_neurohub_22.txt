To generate a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a user, I want to assign tags to files that I have uploaded", we'll outline the interactions between the system components involved in the process of tagging files. The scenario starts after a user has successfully uploaded a file into the system.

Here's a PlantUML diagram reflecting this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "File Management System" as fileSystem
participant "Database" as database

user -> web : Selects file to tag
web -> fileSystem : Request tagging interface for file
fileSystem -> web : Display tagging interface
user -> web : Inputs tags
web -> database : Update file with tags
database -> web : Confirm tags updated
web -> user : Display confirmation message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the user selecting a file to tag, which initiates a request to the system for a tagging interface. The Web Interface component acts as the middle man between the user and the back-end systems, requesting the tagging interface from the File Management System, which in turn responds with the interface for display. The user inputs the desired tags, and these tags are then sent back to the system to be stored in the Database. Once the tags are successfully updated in the database, a confirmation message is displayed to the user.

To use this diagram, ensure you have PlantUML installed or use an online PlantUML editor. Copy and paste the code snippet into the PlantUML environment to generate the sequence diagram. This diagram is a simplified representation and could be expanded based on actual system complexity, including error handling, authentication, and authorization processes.

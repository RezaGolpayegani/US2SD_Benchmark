To visualize the process described in your user story ("As a FABS user, I want to download the uploaded FABS file, so that I can get the uploaded file."), I'll draft a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This diagram will depict the interactions between the user (FABS User) and the system components involved in downloading an uploaded FABS file.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FABSUser as User
participant WebInterface as UI
participant VerificationService as Verify
participant FileService as File
database FABSDB as DB

User -> UI: Request to download FABS file
activate UI

UI -> Verify: Validate user permissions
activate Verify

Verify -> UI: Validation successful
deactivate Verify

UI -> File: Request file from DB
activate File

File -> DB: Query for FABS file
activate DB

DB -> File: Return file details
deactivate DB

File -> UI: Provide file download link
deactivate File

UI -> User: Display download link
deactivate UI

User -> UI: Click download link
activate UI

UI -> File: Initiate file download
activate File

File -> User: Stream FABS file
deactivate File
deactivate UI

This sequence diagram follows the flow from the FABS user's request to download their uploaded FABS file, through the system's verification of user permissions, querying the database for the file, and providing the file to the user for download. It captures the high-level interactions and ensures that each step needed for the user to achieve their goal is represented.

In this scenario:

1. **FABS User (User)**: Initiates the request to download the FABS file by interacting with the web interface.
2. **Web Interface (UI)**: Acts as the first receiver of the request and directs the user's request to the appropriate services for processing.
3. **Verification Service (Verify)**: Handles permission and authentication checks to ensure that the user is authorized to download the requested file.
4. **File Service (File)**: Manages the request to locate and prepare the FABS file for download.
5. **FABS Database (DB)**: Stores the FABS file and is queried to retrieve the file based on the user's request.

Note that for implementing this diagram, you would need a PlantUML environment or a compatible tool where you can paste the script and generate the diagram. This provides a baseline, but depending on the specifics of your system's architecture, additional details or components might be necessary.

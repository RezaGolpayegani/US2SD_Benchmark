Below is a detailed PlantUML description for a sequence diagram portraying the process for a Data Publishing User who wants to know the requirements for their data to be visualizable on a map, allowing them to ensure their data meets these criteria.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as user
participant "OpenSpending\nPlatform" as platform
participant "Data Model\nEditor" as editor
participant "Visualization\nRequirements" as requirements
participant "Data Validation\nService" as validator
participant "Map\nVisualization Feature" as mapView

== User Requests Information on Data Visualization Requirements ==
user -> platform: Access data publishing section
activate platform

platform -> requirements: Fetch map visualization criteria
activate requirements

requirements --> user: Display required data fields\nand formats for map visualization
deactivate requirements

== User Prepares Dataset Based on Requirements ==
user -> editor: Open Data Model Editor
activate editor

user -> editor: Input/Edit data\naccording to requirements
editor -> validator: Validate data with map criteria
activate validator

validator -> editor: Return validation results
deactivate validator

alt If Data Meets Requirements
    editor --> user: Notify data compliance\nwith map visualization
    deactivate editor
    
    user -> platform: Submit validated dataset
    deactivate platform
    
    platform -> mapView: Initiate map visualization process
    activate mapView
    
    mapView -> platform: Generate map visualization
    mapView --> user: Provide link/access to\nmap visualization
    deactivate mapView
else Data Does Not Meet Requirements
    editor --> user: Notify data non-compliance\nsuggest corrections
    deactivate editor
    deactivate platform
end

This sequence diagram starts with the user accessing the data publishing section of the OpenSpending platform to fetch the necessary requirements for visualizing data on a map. The platform responds with the criteria, including the required data fields and formats. Using the Data Model Editor, the user prepares their dataset according to these requirements and submits it for validation. If the dataset meets the requirements, the platform notifies the user of compliance, accepts the dataset, and proceeds to initiate the map visualization process, eventually providing the user with access to the map visualization. If the dataset does not meet the requirements, the user is notified and given suggestions for corrections.

This diagram is structured to clearly represent the interactions between the user and various components of the OpenSpending platform involved in preparing and visualizing data on a map, providing a straightforward visualization of the required process.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format involves visualizing the interaction between objects (actors, system components, etc.) involved in the process of indicating external descriptions of collections that are outside the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS), yet important for users. Here's how this scenario would typically unfold, represented in PlantUML syntax:

```
@startuml
!theme plain

actor "Repository Manager" as repoManager
participant ":User Interface (UI)" as ui
participant ":DIMS Backend" as backEnd
participant ":External Links Manager" as extLinkMgr
participant ":Database" as db

== Indicate External Descriptions of Collections outside DAMS ==

repoManager -> ui : access DIMS
ui -> backEnd : request collection management page
backEnd -> ui : return collection management page
repoManager -> ui : select "Indicate External Descriptions"
ui -> backEnd : request external description form
backEnd -> ui : return external description form
repoManager -> ui : inputs external descriptions\nand submits
ui -> backEnd : submit external description details
backEnd -> extLinkMgr : process external descriptions
extLinkMgr -> db : update collection with\nexternal descriptions
db -> extLinkMgr : confirm update
extLinkMgr -> backEnd : indicate success
backEnd -> ui : show success message
ui -> repoManager : display success message

This PlantUML code outlines the sequence of actions from the perspective of a Repository Manager indicating external descriptions for collections. The steps are as follows:

1. **Repository Manager Accesses DIMS:** The repository manager accesses the DIMS through the user interface.
2. **Request Collection Management Page:** The DIMS backend is requested to provide the collection management page.
3. **Select "Indicate External Descriptions":** The repository manager selects the option to indicate external descriptions related to a collection.
4. **Input External Descriptions:** The repository manager fills in the external description details in the form provided through the user interface.
5. **Submit External Description Details:** The details are submitted to the DIMS backend.
6. **Process External Descriptions:** The DIMS backend forwards the external description details to the External Links Manager component.
7. **Update Database:** The External Links Manager updates the collection record in the database with the external descriptions.
8. **Confirm Update:** The database confirms the update to the External Links Manager.
9. **Indicate Success:** The External Links Manager indicates success to the DIMS backend, which in turn informs the user interface.
10. **Display Success Message:** The repository manager sees a success message indicating that the external descriptions have been successfully added to the collection.

This diagram is a simplified view of the interactions and ignores error handling and authentication steps for clarity. Depending on the complexity and design of the actual DIMS system, additional steps or components may be involved.

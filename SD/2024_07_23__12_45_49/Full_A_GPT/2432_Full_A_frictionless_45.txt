Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided in PlantUML syntax requires identifying the main actors and systems involved, and how they interact to accomplish the goal of validating data with minimal clicks. The sequence diagram will visualize the steps a Researcher or Publisher needs to take to validate their data using the DPIE platform.

Given the scope of DPIE, let's assume a typical workflow involves a user uploading a data package, choosing a validation service, and receiving feedback, all within a streamlined user interface.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

actor ResearcherPublisher as rp
participant "DPIE Web Interface" as web
participant "ValidationService" as vs
participant "DataPackage API" as api
database "DPIE Server" as server

rp -> web: Access DPIE
activate web

web -> web: Display options for data packages
rp -> web: Uploads data package
activate web

web -> api: Request to validate package
activate api

api -> server: Check existing packages
activate server
server --> api: Package doesn't exist
deactivate server

api -> vs: Send data package for validation
activate vs

vs -> vs: Validate against profiles
vs -> vs: Ensure data integrity
vs --> api: Return validation results
deactivate vs

api --> web: Display validation results
deactivate api

web -> rp: Show validation success and feedback
deactivate web

This sequence diagram begins with the Researcher or Publisher ("rp") accessing the DPIE Web Interface. They upload a data package for validation. The Web Interface communicates with the DataPackage API to request package validation. The API checks if the package already exists on the DPIE Server. Finding it does not, the API then sends the package to a designated ValidationService. This service validates the package against pre-determined profiles checking data integrity and conformance to standards. The results are sent back to the API, which then instructs the Web Interface to display the validation outcome to the Researcher or Publisher.

This diagram assumes a simplified view of the process, focusing on critical interactions to validate data. Depending on the requirements and architecture of DPIE, additional steps or services (e.g., authentication, data cleaning, result caching) may be incorporated into the actual workflow.

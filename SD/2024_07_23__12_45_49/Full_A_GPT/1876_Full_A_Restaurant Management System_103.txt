To generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to change the mean when necessary," let's structure the process. This sequence involves several systems and actors, including the manager, the restaurant management system's interface, and the backend database that reflects changes across the system.

This scenario captures the steps a manager would take to update the menu, including logging into the system, accessing the menu management module, making changes to the menu items, and saving those changes. The diagram will demonstrate the interactions between the manager, frontend UI, and backend services to accomplish this task.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Manager as M
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Menu Management\nModule" as MMM
participant "Backend API" as BA
database "Database" as DB

== Menu Update Process ==
M -> UI: Access system
UI --> M: Display dashboard

M -> UI: Select 'Menu Management'
UI -> MMM: Request menu details
MMM -> BA: Query current menu items
BA -> DB: SELECT menu items
DB --> BA: Return menu items
BA --> MMM: Menu items data
MMM --> UI: Display menu items
UI --> M: Show menu items

M -> UI: Initiate menu change
UI -> MMM: Access menu edit mode
MMM --> UI: Provide edit interface
UI --> M: Display edit interface

M -> UI: Update menu items
UI -> MMM: Submit updated menu items
MMM -> BA: Update menu items request
BA -> DB: UPDATE menu items
DB --> BA: Confirm changes
BA --> MMM: Menu update confirmation
MMM --> UI: Display success message
UI --> M: Confirm menu updated

This PlantUML sequence diagram breaks down the interaction flow for a manager to update the menu in the restaurant management system:

1. **Manager Accesses System**: The manager begins by logging into the system and being presented with the dashboard through the UI.
2. **Navigate to Menu Management**: The manager selects the option to manage the menu, prompting the system to fetch and display current menu items.
3. **Initiate Menu Change**: Once the existing menu items are displayed, the manager chooses to make changes, entering an interface where these updates can be made.
4. **Update Menu Items**: The manager makes necessary changes to the menu items, which are then submitted to the system.
5. **System Processes Changes**: The updated menu items are processed by the backend API, which interacts with the database to apply these changes.
6. **Confirmation**: After the database has been updated, a confirmation message is displayed to the manager, indicating that the menu has been successfully updated.

This diagram provides a high-level view of the process involved when a manager decides to update the restaurant menu using the proposed Restaurant Management and Operations System.

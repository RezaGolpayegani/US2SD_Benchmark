Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story involving a dataset developer packaging a dataset type requires visualizing the interactions between different components and actors within the system. Since I can't draw or render actual diagrams here, I'll describe how to create a PlantUML sequence diagram code snippet that outlines this process.

The following sequence involves the dataset developer using an archetype (template or boilerplate) to package their dataset type properly. This process ensures that dataset types are correctly defined, including their schemas, configurations, and any necessary code for seamless integration and deployment within the application ecosystem.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Dataset Developer" as developer
participant "Archetype Tool" as archetype
participant "Dataset Repository" as repo
participant "Build System" as build
participant "Application Ecosystem" as ecosystem

== Packaging Process ==
developer -> archetype : Request to create dataset package
activate archetype

archetype -> archetype : Generate dataset template
archetype --> developer : Provide dataset template
deactivate archetype

developer -> developer : Define dataset type\n(Schemas, Configurations, Code)
developer -> build : Upload dataset package
activate build

build -> build : Validate package integrity and compatibility
alt Validation Successful
  build -> repo : Store validated dataset package
  activate repo
  repo --> build : Acknowledge storage
  deactivate repo

  build --> developer : Notify successful packaging and storage
else Validation Fails
  build --> developer : Return error message
end
deactivate build

developer -> ecosystem : Deploy dataset type for app integration
activate ecosystem

ecosystem -> ecosystem : Integrate dataset type
ecosystem --> developer : Confirm successful deployment and integration
deactivate ecosystem

This PlantUML code outlines the sequence of interactions that might occur between a dataset developer and the system components when packaging a dataset type properly:

1. **Request Template**: The "Dataset Developer" initiates the process by requesting an archetype for creating the dataset package.
2. **Template Generation**: The "Archetype Tool" generates a dataset template, which includes the necessary boilerplate or structure for the dataset type, and provides it to the developer.
3. **Define Dataset Type**: The developer then uses this template to define the dataset type, including setting up schemas, configurations, and any required code.
4. **Upload for Validation**: The defined dataset package is uploaded to the "Build System" for validation.
5. **Validation and Storage**: If the package passes validation checks, it is stored in the "Dataset Repository"; otherwise, an error message is returned.
6. **Deployment**: Finally, the developer deploys the validated dataset type within the "Application Ecosystem" for integration with apps.

This sequence aims to ensure that the new dataset types are properly packaged, validated, and ready for seamless deployment and integration within the application ecosystem, enhancing data management and version control processes.

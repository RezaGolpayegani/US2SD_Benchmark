Given the complexity and multifaceted nature of the Restaurant Management and Operations System described in your project, it's crucial to capture the interactions for a specific user story effectively. Below is a sequence diagram expressed in PlantUML format that outlines the process for a waiter wanting to view the total ordered items. This sequence represents a simplified view focusing on key interactions between the system components and the waiter. 

Please note, while PlantUML supports a wide range of UML diagrams, the text-based nature of this description simplifies complex interactions for clarity and understanding.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as WI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Database" as DB

== View Total Ordered Items Sequence ==

Waiter -> WI: Request total ordered items
activate WI
WI -> OMS: Get total items for waiter's tables
activate OMS
OMS -> DB: Fetch ordered items data
activate DB
DB --> OMS: Ordered items data
deactivate DB
OMS --> WI: Total items information
deactivate OMS
WI --> Waiter: Show total ordered items

### Explanation:

1. **Waiter Initiates Request**: The sequence begins with the waiter requesting to view the total ordered items usually from a digital device or terminal (Waiter Interface).

2. **Waiter Interface to Order Management System**: The Waiter Interface sends a request to the Order Management System (OMS) to fetch the total items ordered for the waiter's assigned tables.

3. **Order Management System Queries Database**: The OMS then interacts with the Database to retrieve the detailed ordered items data relevant to the waiter's request.

4. **Database Responds with Data**: The Database provides the ordered items data back to the OMS, detailing all necessary information regarding the orders placed.

5. **OMS Processes and Responds**: After receiving the data from the Database, the OMS processes this information and calculates the total ordered items for the waiter's tables.

6. **Waiter Interface Displays Information**: Finally, the total items information is sent back to the Waiter Interface, which then displays the total ordered items to the waiter.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction process but captures the essential steps involved in fulfilling the waiterâ€™s request to view total ordered items. Depending on the specific implementation details and requirements of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, additional steps or interactions could be included.

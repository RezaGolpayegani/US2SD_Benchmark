To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to add books to the library" using PlantUML, you need to consider the steps involved in this process and how different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) interact during the book addition process. The components typically include the User Interface (UI), Controller, Database, and possibly external systems for ISBN verification and book details autofill (though this detail wasn't mentioned in your requirement, it's a common feature in modern library management systems).

Below is a simplified example of how you might structure this sequence diagram in PlantUML code. This example assumes that the librarian uses a web interface to submit book information, which is then processed by the backend system and stored in the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as L
participant "UI:Library Management" as UI
participant "Controller" as C
participant "BookService" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

L -> UI: Accesses add book form
UI -> L: Returns add book form
L -> UI: Submits book details
UI -> C: AddBook(details)
C -> BS: VerifyBook(details)
alt If book details are incomplete or incorrect
    BS -> BS: Validate details
    BS --> C: Return error
    C --> UI: Show error message
    UI --> L: Requests correct details
else If details are complete and correct
    BS --> C: Book verified
    C -> DB: SaveBook(details)
    deactivate C
    DB --> C: Confirm save
    C --> UI: Show success message
    UI --> L: Displays success
end

### Explanation:

1. **Librarian (Actor):** Initiates the process by accessing and submitting the book addition form.
2. **UI (Library Management):** Represents the user interface through which the librarian interacts with the system.
3. **Controller:** Acts as the intermediary that receives the book details from the UI and hands them over to the service layer for processing.
4. **BookService:** Represents the business logic layer; it verifies the submitted book details. This could include internal logic checks or even external API calls for ISBN verification not explicitly shown here.
5. **Database:** Where the book details are ultimately stored. This could be any relational or NoSQL database system.

### Note:
- The "alt" block is used to show conditional logic, where there's a path for error in book details and a success path when details are valid.
- This diagram simplifies interactions and assumes a straightforward validation and storage process. Real-world scenarios might involve more complex validation, error handling, or interaction with external systems for additional details or verification.

Feel free to adapt or expand this code based on more specific requirements of the CLMS project or additional features and interactions not covered in this basic scenario.

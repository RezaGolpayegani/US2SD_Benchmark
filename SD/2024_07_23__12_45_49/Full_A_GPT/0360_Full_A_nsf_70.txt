To create a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram based on the provided user story, we need to align components such as the NSF Employee, the Project Management System, Notification System, and potentially an Internal Calendar or Scheduling Tool that might be used for planning and notifying employees about meetings. Since the provided description emphasizes collaboration and communication, it's logical to assume these systems or processes are in place.

Given that PlantUML syntax might not render here, I'll describe how you might structure it:

1. **Title**: Indicate the purpose of the diagram.
2. **Participants**: List the entities involved like NSF Employee, Project Management System, Notification System, and Internal Calendar/Scheduling Tool.
3. **Flow**:
    - NSF Employee requests information about the in-person meeting.
    - The Project Management System receives the request and checks the Internal Calendar/Scheduling Tool for scheduled meetings.
    - The Project Management System retrieves meeting information, including the location and time.
    - Notification System is used to send the details to the NSF Employee.
4. **Return**: NSF Employee receives the information and acknowledges.

Here's how you could write it in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
title NSF In-Person Meeting Information Flow

actor NSF_Employee as "NSF Employee"
entity Project_Management_System as "Project Management System"
entity Internal_Calendar as "Internal Calendar/Scheduling Tool"
entity Notification_System as "Notification System"

== Initial Request ==
NSF_Employee -> Project_Management_System: Requests meeting info

== Check Meeting Details ==
Project_Management_System -> Internal_Calendar: Check for scheduled meetings
Internal_Calendar -> Project_Management_System: Meeting details (date, time, location)

== Notify Employee ==
Project_Management_System -> Notification_System: Prepare meeting details notification
Notification_System -> NSF_Employee: Send meeting details

This UML sequence diagram illustrates the process from the point of view of an NSF employee inquiring about the initial in-person meeting details to receiving the information. This example assumes a simplified workflow where the systems involved are interconnected, which may or may not reflect the actual complexity of the real-world process, especially regarding the integration between different software platforms the NSF might be using.

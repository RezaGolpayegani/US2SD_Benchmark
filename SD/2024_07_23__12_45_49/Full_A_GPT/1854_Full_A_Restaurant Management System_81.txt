Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves breaking down the various steps that occur when a management user requests the daily order numbers of the waiters as a report. This diagram will involve interactions between management users, the restaurant management system, and possibly the database where orders and waiter performance metrics are stored.

Here's a representation in PlantUML format to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Management User" as Mgmt
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Server/Backend" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Mgmt -> Web : Request daily order numbers report
Web -> Server : Retrieve daily order numbers
Server -> DB : Query waiter order numbers and performance data
DB --> Server : Return data
Server --> Web : Process and generate report
Web --> Mgmt : Display report

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the process begins with the management user requesting the daily order numbers report. The request is sent from the web interface the management user interacts with (this could be a webpage or a managerial app interface), which forwards the request to the backend server. The server then queries the database for the required information, which could include each waiter's total orders for the day, performance metrics, and any complaints or notes on service delays or issues. Once the database returns this data, the server processes it, potentially calculating averages, identifying outliers, or compiling summaries, and then sends this processed information back through the web interface to the management user who reviews the report.

The assumption here is that the restaurant management and operations system has a unified backend (Node.js with Express is suggested in the project description), which interacts with a database (either MongoDB or PostgreSQL). The choice between MongoDB and PostgreSQL could affect how the data is queried and processed, but this is abstract, high-level sequence diagram illustrates the general flow rather than specific technical implementations. Cloud services (AWS or Google Cloud) could be where the server and database are hosted, providing the necessary scalability and security for the system's data.

To capture the flow of the site administrator's investigation of how similar organizations handle content through sequence diagrams in PlantUML, the diagram would illustrate interactions between the site administrator, the website (which might include both the beta site being developed and other organizations' websites for comparative analysis), and possibly a content management system (CMS) where insights and findings are documented. Given the nature of this user story, the sequence diagram will focus on the investigation and documentation process.

Please note, sequence diagrams are best suited for illustrating interactions around a specific process or use case, so some creative liberties are employed here to adapt the narrative of researching content strategies into a sequence that can be diagrammed.

Here's a PlantUML code skeleton that depicts these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant SiteAdministrator as Admin
participant "Beta Website" as BetaSite
participant "Other Organizations' Websites" as OtherSites
participant CMS

== Investigation Phase ==
Admin -> OtherSites : Visit sites
OtherSites --> Admin : Display Content Strategies

Admin -> Admin : Analyze Content Strategies
Admin -> BetaSite : Compare Content Features

== Documentation Phase ==
Admin -> CMS : Open New Document
Admin -> CMS : Document Insights
CMS --> Admin : Confirm Documentation

== Decision Making ==
Admin -> CMS : Review Documented Insights
CMS --> Admin : Display Documented Insights

Admin -> BetaVirtualMeeting : Discuss with Team\n(Share Insights)

== Apply Insights ==
Admin -> BetaSite : Plan Content Strategy Changes

### Explanation of the Diagram:

- **Investigation Phase:**
  1. The site administrator (Admin) starts the process by visiting other organizations' websites (OtherSites) to observe and analyze how they manage and present content.
  2. These websites display various content strategies to the site administrator.

- **Documentation Phase:**
  1. The administrator opens a new document in the CMS (assumed to be a feature for internal documentation) to document the insights gained from the investigation.
  2. The administrator documents the insights and findings about what content strategies seem to work well or not based upon the comparative analysis.
  3. The CMS confirms the documentation of these insights.

- **Decision Making:**
  1. The site administrator reviews the documented insights within the CMS to gather solid data for decision-making.
  2. The CMS displays the documented insights back to the administrator.

- **Apply Insights:**
  1. Based on these insights, the administrator plans changes to the beta website's content strategy, aiming to implement effective content management and presentation practices observed during the investigation.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation. Depending on the technical and business specifics, you might need to adjust or expand it. For instance, if the CMS has capabilities for direct comparison or content strategy tools, interactions with those components could be detailed further.

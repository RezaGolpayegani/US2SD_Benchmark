Given the complexity of the project described, creating a detailed sequence diagram for the preservation of content and metadata within a digital repository involves several actors and systems. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format focusing on the interaction between the library staff member and the repository system with an emphasis on content and metadata preservation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff" as staff
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Repository System" as system
database "Content Storage" as storage
database "Metadata Database" as metadata
participant "Preservation System" as preservation

== Preserve Content and Metadata ==

staff -> web : Select content for preservation
web -> system : Trigger preservation process
activate system

system -> storage : Retrieve content
activate storage
storage --> system : Content
deactivate storage

system -> metadata : Extract associated metadata
activate metadata
metadata --> system : Metadata details
deactivate metadata

system -> preservation : Prepare preservation package\n(content + metadata)
activate preservation

preservation -> preservation : Validate package integrity
preservation -> preservation : Apply preservation policies

preservation -> storage : Store preserved content
activate storage
storage --> preservation : Confirm storage
deactivate storage

preservation -> metadata : Update preservation metadata
activate metadata
metadata --> preservation : Confirm metadata update
deactivate metadata

deactivate preservation

system --> web : Display preservation status
web -> staff : Show success message

This diagram outlines the essential steps involved when a library staff member initiates the preservation process. It starts with selecting the content for preservation via the web interface, triggering the internal processes within the repository system to handle, validate, and store the content and its associated metadata in a manner that ensures long-term access and integrity.

Please note, depending on the specific implementation details and technologies used at Cornell University, additional steps or components (such as third-party preservation services, more detailed validation processes, or specific compliance checks) might be needed. This diagram serves as a high-level overview and might require adjustments to fit the actual system architecture and workflows.

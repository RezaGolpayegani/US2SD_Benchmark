Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a site visitor, I want to have an advanced search option that lets me fill in a form of search criteria, so that I can quickly find what I am looking for" requires outlining the interactions between the site visitor, the website's front-end, and back-end systems, specifically for handling advanced search queries. Below is the PlantUML code to depict this sequence.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Site Visitor" as visitor
participant "Search Form" as form
participant "Search Controller" as controller
database "Search Database" as database
participant "Search Results Page" as resultsPage

== Advanced Search Flow ==

visitor -> form : Access advanced search
activate form

form -> visitor : Display form fields
activate visitor

visitor -> form : Submit search criteria
deactivate visitor
activate form

form -> controller : Send criteria
deactivate form
activate controller

controller -> database : Query based on criteria
activate database

database -> controller : Return query results
deactivate database
activate controller

controller -> resultsPage : Display results to visitor
deactivate controller
activate resultsPage

resultsPage -> visitor : Show search results
deactivate resultsPage

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the basic flow of a site visitor utilizing the advanced search feature. Here's a brief run-through of the steps involved:

1. **Access and Display**: The visitor accesses the advanced search form, upon which the system displays the form fields.
2. **Form Submission**: The visitor fills in the search criteria and submits the form.
3. **Send Criteria**: The search form sends the criteria to the Search Controller.
4. **Query Execution**: The Search Controller queries the Search Database based on the provided criteria.
5. **Results Retrieval**: The Search Database returns the query results to the Search Controller.
6. **Display Results**: The Search Controller sends these results to the Search Results Page, which is then shown to the visitor.

This sequence diagram assumes a simplified flow focusing on interactions concerning the advanced search feature without delving into authentication or error handling for brevity. Detailed implementation might need to consider these aspects.

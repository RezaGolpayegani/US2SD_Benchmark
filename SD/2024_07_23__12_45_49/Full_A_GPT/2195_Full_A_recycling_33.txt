To visualize the process described in the user story "As a company accountant, I want to view all available activity fees online, so that I can easily create a bill statement." in the context of the RecycleSmart Platform project, a sequence diagram can effectively represent the interactions between the accountant (acting as a user), the platform, and other system components involved in fetching and displaying the information regarding activity fees. 

Here's a sequence diagram in Plant UML format that outlines the expected sequence of actions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Accountant as acc
participant "RecycleSmart\nPlatform Interface" as interface
participant "Authentication\nModule" as auth
participant "Database" as db
participant "Fees\nManagement Service" as fees

acc -> interface : Request to view activity fees
interface -> auth : Validate session
auth --> interface : Session valid

interface -> fees : Fetch available fees
fees -> db : Query fees data
db --> fees : Return fees data
fees --> interface : Fees details
interface --> acc : Display fees information

acc -> interface : Select fees for bill statement
interface -> fees : Process selected fees
fees -> interface : Confirm selection
interface --> acc : Display bill statement draft
acc -> interface : Confirm to create bill statement
interface -> fees : Generate bill statement
fees --> interface : Bill statement generated
interface --> acc : Display/download bill statement

```

This diagram illustrates the following interactions for the use case:
- The accountant requests to view the activity fees through the RecycleSmart Platform Interface.
- The platform's Authentication Module validates the accountant's session.
- Once validated, the interface requests the Fees Management Service to fetch the available fees.
- The Fees Management Service queries the database to get the fees data, which is then returned to the interface.
- The accountant selects the fees they wish to include in the bill statement.
- The platform acknowledges the selection and displays a draft of the bill statement for confirmation.
- Upon confirmation, the Fees Management Service generates a bill statement, which is then made available for the accountant to display or download.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions between the system components for viewing and generating a bill statement based on the available activity fees within the RecycleSmart Platform.

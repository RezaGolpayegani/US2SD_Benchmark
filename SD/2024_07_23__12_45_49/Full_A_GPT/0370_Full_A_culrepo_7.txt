Given the specific requirements of the user story within the context of a sophisticated project description for a digital repository system for Cornell University, the following represents a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, outlining the process flow for a database/information retrieval (DB/IR) administrator managing name changes of reports/datasets. This ensures that both current and historic reports are findable by patrons, despite name variations over time.

The sequence diagram reflects key interactions among system components, such as the DB/IR Administrator, Content Management System (CMS), Database, and the End User (Patron), to facilitate this process.

```
@startuml
participant Patron
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "CMS" as CMS
database "Database" as DB
participant "DB/IR Administrator" as Admin

note over Patron, Admin: Name Change Management for Reports/Datasets

Patron->Search: enter search term for report/dataset
Search->DB: query report/dataset name
DB-->Search: return search results
Search-->Patron: display current and historic names

Patron->Search: select historic report
Search->DB: query selected historic report
DB-->Search: return requested content

Search-->Patron: display historic report content
Patron->Patron: review content

== Name Change Management ==
Admin->CMS: log in
CMS-->Admin: authentication success

Admin->CMS: initiate name change for report/dataset
CMS->DB: check if name exists
DB-->CMS: name check result

alt If name exists with historic records
    CMS->Admin: prompt for merge or separate entry
    Admin->CMS: select merge with historic
    CMS->DB: merge records under new name
    DB-->CMS: merge confirmation
    CMS-->Admin: display success message
else New Name
    CMS->DB: update record with new name
    DB-->CMS: update confirmation
    CMS-->Admin: display success in name change
end

note over Admin: Monitor for any issues or inconsistencies
Admin->CMS: periodically review report/dataset names
CMS->DB: fetch all report/dataset names
DB-->CMS: returns list
CMS-->Admin: display report/dataset names for review

This diagram depicts the recommended interactions for managing report and dataset name changes within the repository system, ensuring that both administrators and patrons can effectively handle and access both current and historical report data. It includes provisions for searching, updating, and decision-making processes that are crucial for maintaining the consistency and integrity of the repositoryâ€™s data.

Please note, customization might be necessary to fit the exact technical infrastructure or specific workflows at Cornell University.

To represent the user story of a patron searching for a report/dataset with keywords or a partial or complete title, we'll detail out a UML sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This example includes actors such as the user (patron) and the system components like the User Interface (UI), Search Controller, Database, and possibly an External Search System if integration with external databases or systems is implied for thorough searches.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Patron
participant "UI" as UI
participant "Search Controller" as SC
participant "Database" as DB
participant "External Search System" as ESS

Patron -> UI : Enter keywords/partial/full title
UI -> SC : Send search query
SC -> DB : Query internal reports/datasets
DB --> SC : Return internal results
SC -> ESS : Query external reports/datasets
ESS --> SC : Return external results
SC --> UI : Display combined results
UI --> Patron : Show search results
@enduml
```

This diagram begins with the Patron interacting with the User Interface to input their search query, which could be keywords or a partial/complete title. The UI then communicates this query to the Search Controller, which is responsible for handling the search logic. 

The Search, in turn, performs multiple actions:
1. It first queries the internal Database for reports or datasets matching the search criteria. The Database returns any relevant internal results.
2. Considering the comprehensive needs and possibly vast repositories at Cornell, the Search Controller may also query an External Search System to ensure comprehensive coverage of available reports and datasets, including those that may be stored or indexed outside of the university's direct systems (e.g., collaborative repositories or public databases).
3. Upon gathering both internal and external results, the Search Controller consolidates this information and sends it back to the UI.
4. Finally, the UI presents the search results to the Patron, who can then proceed to review or access the reports/datasets of interest.

This flow delineates how the system would process a search query from start to finish, ensuring that the patron's need for comprehensive search capabilities is met with efficiency and accuracy.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story, "As an employee, I want to mark the order as completed," involves several components such as the employee interface, the backend server, and the database. Here is a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates this process:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Employee as e
participant "Employee Interface" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as server
database "Database" as db

e -> ui: Selects Order
ui -> server: Request to Mark Order as Completed
server -> db: Update Order Status
db --> server: Confirmation
server --> ui: Order Marked as Completed
ui --> e: Display Success Message

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Employee selecting the order they wish to mark as completed through the Employee Interface. The selection is then sent to the Backend Server as a request to mark the order as completed. The Backend Server updates the order status in the Database. Once the Database confirms the update to the Backend Server, the server then informs the Employee Interface, which in turn displays a success message to the Employee.

This simplified sequence is illustrative and could be expanded based on specific project requirements, such as security checks, logging, error handling, and notifications to other stakeholders (e.g., notifying the chef or cashier about the order status change). Depending on the complexity of the system and the workflow, additional steps might be included.

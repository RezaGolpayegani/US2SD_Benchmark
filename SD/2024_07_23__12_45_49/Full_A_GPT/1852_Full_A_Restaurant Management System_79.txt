Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to update my comments" involves illustrating the interactions between the customer, the system's user interface, and various back-end components that handle the comment updating process. This process could involve the customer accessing their past orders, selecting a specific order to comment on, updating their comment, and the system saving this updated comment into the database. Here's how these interactions can be described in PlantUML syntax to generate a sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "UI: Web/App Interface" as UI
participant "Server: Comments Controller" as Controller
database "DB: Comments Storage" as DB

activate Customer
Customer -> UI: Select "My Orders"
activate UI
UI -> Controller: Request past orders
activate Controller
Controller -> DB: Fetch orders for customer
activate DB
DB --> Controller: Return orders
deactivate DB
Controller --> UI: Display orders
deactivate Controller
UI --> Customer: Show past orders

Customer -> UI: Select order to comment
UI -> Controller: Request comment form
activate Controller
Controller --> UI: Provide comment form
deactivate Controller
UI --> Customer: Display comment form

Customer -> UI: Update comment
UI -> Controller: Submit updated comment
activate Controller
Controller -> DB: Update comment in DB
activate DB
DB --> Controller: Confirm update
deactivate DB
Controller --> UI: Update confirmation
deactivate Controller
UI --> Customer: Display confirmation message
deactivate UI

This diagram starts with the Customer interacting with the User Interface (Web/App Interface) to select their past orders. The UI then communicates with the Server's Comments Controller to fetch and display the orders. The Customer chooses an order to comment on, triggering the UI to request a comment form from the Controller, which is displayed to the Customer. The Customer submits their updated comment through the UI, which then sends the information to the Controller. The Controller updates the comment in the Comments Storage database and sends a confirmation back to the UI, which finally informs the Customer that their comment has been successfully updated.

This sequence ensures a clear visualization of the processes involved from the moment the customer decides to update a comment until the system confirms the action has been completed successfully.

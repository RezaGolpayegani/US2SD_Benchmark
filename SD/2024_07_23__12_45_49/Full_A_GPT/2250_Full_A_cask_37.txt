To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story you provided, we need to conceptualize the interactions between the actors (in this case, the dataset developer) and the components of the advanced dataset management and version control system. The specific user story involves a dataset developer implementing a migration procedure after a dataset instance is upgraded to a new version of its type.

Here's a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram that illustrates this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DatasetDeveloper as developer
participant "Dataset Management System" as DMS
participant "Version Control" as VC
participant "Dataset Instance" as DI
participant "Migration Tool" as MT

== Upgrade Dataset Instance ==
developer -> DMS: Request dataset type version upgrade
DMS -> VC: Check latest version
VC --> DMS: Return latest version info
DMS -> DI: Perform upgrade to new version
DI --> DMS: Upgrade success confirmation
DMS --> developer: Upgrade success notice

== Implement Migration Procedure ==
developer -> DMS: Request to implement migration procedure
activate DMS
DMS -> MT: Provide current and new version details
activate MT
MT --> DMS: Migration procedure template
DMS --> developer: Migration procedure template
deactivate DMS

developer -> MT: Define migration steps based on template
activate MT
MT -> MT: Validate migration steps
MT --> developer: Confirm migration steps valid
deactivate MT

== Run Migration Procedure ==
developer -> DMS: Initiate migration procedure
DMS -> MT: Execute migration steps
activate MT
MT -> DI: Apply migration steps to dataset instance
DI --> MT: Migration success confirmation
MT --> DMS: Migration completed
DMS --> developer: Migration success notice
deactivate MT

In this sequence diagram, the process starts when the dataset developer requests a dataset type version upgrade. The Dataset Management System (DMS) checks with the Version Control (VC) for the latest version and, upon receiving the information, performs the upgrade on the Dataset Instance (DI). The DI confirms the success of the upgrade back to the DMS, which in turn notifies the developer.

Then, the developer requests to implement a migration procedure. The DMS provides a migration procedure template that the developer uses to define the migration steps. The Migration Tool (MT) validates these steps, and upon confirmation, the developer initiates the migration procedure through the DMS, which then commands the MT to execute these steps on the DI. Finally, the MT confirms the successful migration to the DMS, which notifies the developer.

This sequence diagram is a basic representation and can be further detailed based on more specific interactions, error handling, and other components of the system per the project's design requirements.

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story, we focus on the process involving a camp administrator who is managing and accessing camper records from previous years. This involves interactions between the camp administrator, the camp management system, and the database where camper records are stored.

Here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "Camp Management \nSystem" as system
database "Camper Records \nDatabase" as db

admin -> system : Log in to manage camper records
activate admin
activate system
system -> db : Retrieve camper records from previous years
activate db
db --> system : Return requested records
deactivate db
system -> system : Display records in user-friendly format
system --> admin : Show camper records
deactivate system
admin -> system : Select record to reuse/update
activate system
system -> db : Update selected record with new details
activate db
db --> system : Confirm record update
deactivate db
system --> admin : Confirm update success
deactivate system
deactivate admin
@enduml
```

Explanation of Steps:

1. **Administrator Logs in to Manage Camper Records**: The sequence begins with the camp administrator logging into the camp management system to manage camper records.

2. **Retrieve Camper Records from Previous Years**: The camp management system queries the Camper Records Database to retrieve camper records from previous years. 

3. **Display Records**: The retrieved records are displayed in a user-friendly format to the administrator. 

4. **Select Record to Reuse/Update**: The administrator selects a record to reuse or update for the current or upcoming camp session.

5. **Update Record**: The selected record is updated with new details in the database, following the administrator's input.

6. **Confirmation**: The system confirms the successful update of the record to the administrator.

This PlantUML sequence diagram provides a simple but detailed view of the interaction flow for keeping camper records from previous years to reduce administrative tasks, as requested in the user story.

Given your request, hereâ€™s a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the flow for an Archivist who wants to see Dates and Extents displayed in both the read and edit views for Accessions and/or Resources before the list of Subjects. This process involves interactions between the Archivist (user), the front-end UI, the back-end server, and the database.

Please note, to fully implement and visualize this sequence diagram, you'll need to either have PlantUML software installed or use an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as user
participant "Frontend UI" as frontend
participant "Backend Server" as backend
participant "Database" as database

user -> frontend : Request Accession/Resource View
frontend -> backend : GET request for Accession/Resource data
backend -> database : Query Accession/Resource data
database --> backend : Return Accession/Resource data
backend --> frontend : Accession/Resource data (include Dates and Extents)
frontend -> frontend : Process data to display Dates and Extents \nbefore the list of Subjects in both views
frontend --> user : Display Accession/Resource View

user -> frontend : Request edit mode for Accession/Resource
frontend -> backend : GET editable fields for Accession/Resource
backend -> database : Query editable fields (include Dates and Extents)
database --> backend : Return editable fields data
backend --> frontend : Editable fields data for Accession/Resource
frontend -> frontend : Enable edit mode, place Dates and Extents fields \nbefore Subjects list
frontend --> user : Display editable Accession/Resource View

user -> frontend : Submit updated Accession/Resource data
frontend -> backend : POST updated Accession/Resource data
backend -> database : Update Accession/Resource record
database --> backend : Confirm record updated
backend --> frontend : Update successful
frontend --> user : Display updated Accession/Resource view with confirmation

This diagram simplifies the overall process and focuses on the sequence related to viewing and editing Dates and Extents for Accessions and/or Resources as an Archivist. Depending on your project's specific technology stack, the names of the participants (e.g., "Backend Server", "Database") and the details of the interactions might need adjustments. This example assumes a common web application architecture pattern involving a frontend UI, a backend server, and a database.

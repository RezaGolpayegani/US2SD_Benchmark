Given your request, below is a PlantUML representation of a sequence diagram for the described user story. The diagram illustrates the interaction between a Data Manager (the actor) and the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool), emphasizing how the Data Manager can discover what software or technology was used to produce or utilize the data within a research project. This example assumes the existence of a "Metadata Retrieval" and a "Technology Info" subsystem within the DMPTool to facilitate these functions.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor DataManager as DM
participant "DMPTool Interface" as DMP
participant "Metadata Retrieval" as MR
participant "Technology Info" as TI

== Determine Data Technology and Background Information ==

DM -> DMP: Access project's DMP
activate DMP
DMP -> MR: Retrieve data schema
activate MR
MR -> TI: Request technology info by dataset
activate TI
TI --> MR: Returns technology details
deactivate TI
MR --> DMP: Provides metadata including technology details
deactivate MR
DMP --> DM: Display technology and software information
deactivate DMP

This diagram begins with the Data Manager accessing the project's Data Management Plan (DMP) through the DMPTool Interface. The interface then interacts with the "Metadata Retrieval" component to fetch the relevant data schema. Subsequently, a request is sent to the "Technology Info" subsystem to obtain details on the technology or software associated with each dataset. Once the technology details are returned to the "Metadata Retrieval" subsystem, the compiled metadata, now including technology information, is sent back to the DMPTool interface, which displays the information to the Data Manager.

Remember, this is a high-level representation. The intricacies of interactions, such as authentication and error handling, have been abstracted for clarity. Depending on your requirements, you might need to adjust or expand upon this sequence to better fit the DMPTool's specific architecture or to account for additional steps in the process.

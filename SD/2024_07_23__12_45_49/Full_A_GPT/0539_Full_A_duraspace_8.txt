Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves delineating the interactions between various actors (e.g., Repository Manager) and components (e.g., DIMS system modules for collection management, access control, and possibly the user interface) under the specific scenario of composing collections in a DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS). Below, you'll find an example of how to structure this interaction using PlantUML syntax.

Please note, this example focuses on core interactions based on the project description and the detailed user story. Adjustments and additions might be necessary to cater to specific system designs or requirements not fully detailed in the description provided.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant ":User Interface" as UI
participant ":Collection Management\nModule" as CM
participant ":Access Control\nModule" as AC
participant ":Database" as DB

== Compose Collection ==

RM -> UI : Initiate collection composition
UI -> CM : Request to compose\nnew collection
activate CM

... 
CM -> CM : Validate composition criteria
...

CM -> AC : Check access rights\nfor collection composition
activate AC
AC --> CM : Access granted
deactivate AC

CM -> DB : Retrieve items with\nsame provenance
activate DB
DB --> CM : List of items
deactivate DB

CM -> CM : Create collection from\nretrieved items
CM --> UI : Show draft of new collection
RM -> UI : Adjust collection\n(add/remove items)
UI -> CM : Update collection draft
CM -> CM : Validate updates
CM --> UI : Show updated collection

RM -> UI : Confirm collection composition
UI -> CM : Confirm new collection
CM -> DB : Store new collection
activate DB
DB --> CM : Confirmation
deactivate DB
CM --> UI : Collection composed successfully
UI --> RM : Display success message

This sequence diagram illustrates a flow where the Repository Manager initiates the process to compose a new collection through the user interface (UI). The Collection Management Module plays a central role in validating composition criteria, interacting with the Access Control Module to ensure the Repository Manager has the necessary rights, and retrieving relevant items from the database based on specified provenance. Adjustments to the collection composition are made based on Repository Manager inputs, with the final confirmation leading to the new collection being stored in the database. The success of the operation is then communicated back to the Repository Manager through the UI.

Remember, sequence diagrams can get quite complex, especially for multifaceted interactions like those in a comprehensive system such as DIMS. The provided example captures the essential steps based on the described user story and project functionality. Depending on the system's specifics, additional details or steps might be needed for a complete implementation blueprint.

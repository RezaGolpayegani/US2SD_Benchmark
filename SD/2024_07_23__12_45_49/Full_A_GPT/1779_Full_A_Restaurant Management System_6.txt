The creation of a sequence diagram for the described user story "As a chef, I want to check the available amount of ingredients" involves depicting the interactions between the chef, the Restaurant Management and Operations System, and possibly other systems or databases involved in managing ingredients. Here's a basic PlantUML sequence diagram to illustrate this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Chef as chef
participant "Management\nSystem UI" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

== Checking Ingredient Availability ==
chef -> UI : Selects "Check Ingredients"
UI -> Backend : Request ingredient list
Backend -> DB : Query available ingredients
DB -> Backend : Return ingredient data
Backend -> UI : Display available ingredients
UI -> chef : Show available amounts of ingredients
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows these steps:

1. The Chef selects the option to "Check Ingredients" in the User Interface (UI) of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.
2. The UI sends a request to the backend server to retrieve a list of ingredients.
3. The backend server queries the Database for the available ingredients.
4. The Database returns the data on ingredient availability to the backend server.
5. The backend server sends this information back to the UI.
6. The UI displays the available amounts of ingredients to the Chef.

This is a simplified illustration. Actual implementations may involve additional steps such as authentication, error handling, and interactions with other microservices or systems for inventory management. Depending on the complexity of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, you might also have modules for supplier order management that could interact with the system to provide information on upcoming ingredient restocks, which would be an important aspect of checking ingredient levels for planning purposes.

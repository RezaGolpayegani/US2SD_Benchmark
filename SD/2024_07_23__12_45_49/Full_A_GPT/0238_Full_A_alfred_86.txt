Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided involves illustrating the interaction between the older person (user), the ALFRED system (including its wearable design process), and potentially other entities involved in delivering the stylish, non-stigmatizing wearable with integrated sensors. Please note, PlantUML code provided here is a high-level overview designed to offer a starting point, and further refinement would be needed based on specifics of your ALFRED system's architecture and processes.

```plantuml

This sequence diagram outlines the process from an older adult (referred to as "User") expressing the desire for a stylish, non-stigmatizing wearable, through the design and production stages, until the wearable is delivered and feedback is provided. It accounts for interactions with the system's user interface, the ALFRED system itself, and both the design and production teams. The feedback loop at the end is essential for continuous improvement and ensuring that the wearables meet the users' expectations for style and discretion. 

Keep in mind, the granularity and detail of the diagram can be adjusted by including more specific steps or technologies involved in the design and production process, based on your project's requirements and technical specifications.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story described using PlantUML, you would illustrate the interactions between the depositor, the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, and potentially other systems involved in applying licenses to datasets. Below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrating these interactions. Note that for simplicity, some potential steps (like authentication) are omitted, but could be added to create a more comprehensive depiction.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Data Management\nPlatform" as Platform
database "License Repository" as LicenseDB

Depositor -> Web: Access dataset management
Web -> Platform: Display dataset options
Platform -> Web: Show dataset licensing options
Web -> Depositor: Present licensing options
Depositor -> Web: Select desired license
Web -> Platform: Submit license choice
Platform -> LicenseDB: Query for license details
LicenseDB -> Platform: Return license details
Platform -> Platform: Apply license to dataset
Platform -> Web: Confirm license application
Web -> Depositor: Display confirmation message

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Depositor accessing the dataset management through a web interface. The system then guides the Depositor through selecting and applying the desired license to their dataset, querying a License Repository to get the details of the chosen license, applying it, and confirming the action.

To expand this, you could add more details, such as steps for Depositor authentication, more detailed interactions with the License Repository (for instance, checking if the chosen license is appropriate for the dataset type), or interactions with other systems for external license validation. Additionally, considering various conditions, like license application failure and the subsequent error handling, could provide a more rounded picture of the system's behavior.

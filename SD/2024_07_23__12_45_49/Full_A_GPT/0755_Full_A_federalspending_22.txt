Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story involving tracking issues mentioned during Tech Thursdays involves various actors and components such as the UI Designer, Issue Tracking System, and potentially a Collaboration Tool like Slack or Email for notifications. For clarity, this sequence will encapsulate steps from the meeting where issues are discussed to the point where the UI Designer starts testing these issues.

Given the user story focus is on tracking and beginning tests on issues raised, this PlantUML diagram will reflect a simplified flow focusing on these aspects.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Tech Thursday Meeting" as TT
participant "UI Designer" as UID
database "Issue Tracking System"  as ITS
participant "Collaboration Tool\n(Slack/Email)" as CT

== Issue Identification ==
TT -> UID : Discuss UI issues
UID -> ITS : Log new issues\n[From meeting notes]
note right of ITS : Issues are categorized and\ndetailed with necessary tags

== Notification ==
ITS -> CT : Send notification\n[New issue logged]
CT -> UID : Display notification\nto UI Designer
UID -> CT : Acknowledge notification

== Issue Tracking ==
UID -> ITS : Review issue details
loop For Each Issue
    ITS -> UID : Provide issue details\nand priority
    UID -> ITS : Update issue\n[Status: Under Review]
    note right of UID : UI Designer prepares\ntests for the issue
end

== Testing Preparation ==
UID -> UID : Prioritize issues based on\nurgency and impact
UID -> UID : Create test plans\nfor each issue

== Testing Execution ==
loop Each Identified Issue
    UID -> UID : Execute tests
    activate UID
    UID -> ITS : Update issue with\n test results
    deactivate UID
    note right of ITS : Status changes to\n[Under Testing] or [Fixed]
end

This sequence diagram translates the user story into a workflow starting from the discussion in Tech Thursday meetings to the point where the UI Designer takes actions on the issues identified. It simplifies the process focusing on the main activities such as issue logging, notification, review and prioritization by the UI Designer, test preparation, and execution phases.

To generate this diagram, you can use any PlantUML editor or integration that supports PlantUML notation. By customizing this further, you could add more details or adjust the sequence to better reflect specific processes or additional steps involved in your project's context.

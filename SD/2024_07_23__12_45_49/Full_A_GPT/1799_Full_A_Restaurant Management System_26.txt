Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the particular user story "As a chef, I want to see the seasonal ingredients so that I can build a menu for every season" involves illustrating the interaction between different components and actors of the Restaurant Management and Operations System to fulfill this request. Below is an example representation in PlantUML language.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Chef
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Server" as S
database "Database" as DB

== View Seasonal Ingredients ==
Chef -> UI : Selects "View Seasonal Ingredients"
activate Chef
activate UI

UI -> S : Request list of seasonal ingredients
activate S

S -> DB : Query seasonal ingredients
activate DB
DB --> S : Return seasonal ingredients list
deactivate DB

S --> UI : Display seasonal ingredients
deactivate S

UI --> Chef : Chef views seasonal ingredients
deactivate UI

== Build Seasonal Menu ==
Chef -> UI : Initiates "Create New Menu"
activate UI

UI -> Chef : Request menu details (name, dishes)
Chef -> UI : Provides menu details with selected seasonal ingredients
activate Chef
deactivate Chef

UI -> S : Send new menu data
activate S

S -> DB : Save new menu
activate DB
DB --> S : Confirm menu saved
deactivate DB

S --> UI : Confirmation of menu creation
deactivate S

UI --> Chef : Display success message
deactivate UI
deactivate Chef

This diagram starts with the chef interacting with the UI interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System to view the list of seasonal ingredients available. Following the initial request, the system communicates through its server to query the database for the current list of seasonal ingredients, which then gets displayed back to the chef through the UI interface. 

Once the seasonal ingredients are reviewed, the chef moves forward to create a new menu for the season. The chef provides the required details for the new menu through the UI, which again communicates with the server to save the new menu into the database. A confirmation of the menu creation is sent back to the chef concluding the process.

Please note, this sequence diagram showcases a simple interaction flow for clarity and understanding; real-world implementations might involve more complex interactions, considering error handling, security checks, and more detailed steps within each process.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story requires showing interactions between the system components and the actors to fulfill the requirement of setting reminders related to specific tasks by a camp administrator. Below, find a PlantUML code snippet that represents this process. 

Note: Due to the limited context provided in the project description, assumptions are made about system components (like "TaskManager", "NotificationService", etc.). You may need to adjust these components based on the actual architecture of your project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CampAdministrator as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "TaskManager" as taskManager
participant "Database" as database
participant "NotificationService" as notification

admin -> dashboard : Access the Dashboard
admin -> dashboard : Choose to set a reminder
dashboard -> taskManager : Initiate task reminder setting
task thesequence_diagram_description: Administrator inputs task details and reminder specifics
taskManager -> database : Save task details
database --> taskManager : Confirmation of saved task
taskManager -> notification : Schedule reminder
notification --> database : Store reminder configuration
database --> notification : Confirmation & reminder ID
notification --> taskManager : Reminder set successfully
taskManager --> dashboard : Display success message
dashboard --> admin : Show confirmation of reminder setup

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Camp Administrator accessing the Dashboard to set a reminder for a task. The process flows through the system's Task Manager, interacts with the Database for storing and confirming task details, and utilizes a Notification Service to schedule and store the reminder setup. Finally, success confirmation is relayed back to the administrator. 

Adjustments may be required based on unique system architecture, additional functionalities, or components involved in your project.

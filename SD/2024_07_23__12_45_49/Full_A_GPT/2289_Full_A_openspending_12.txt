To create a sequence diagram that depicts the mentioned user story in Plant UML format, first, let's break down the steps needed to represent this process:

1. The Data Publishing User initiates the import process by selecting the "Import Data" option in the OpenSpending platform.
2. The user is prompted to choose the source of the data. They select "Google Spreadsheet".
3. The user then needs to authenticate with Google, assuming they're not already logged in.
4. Post-authentication, the user selects the specific spreadsheet they want to import.
5. The platform retrieves the selected data from Google Spreadsheet.
6. The data is then converted into a format compatible with the data packager.
7. Finally, the user is shown a success message and has the option to further edit or directly publish the dataset.

Now, here's how you can represent these steps in a Plant UML format to create a detailed sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Publishing User" as User
participant "OpenSpending Platform" as Platform
participant "Google Authentication" as GoogleAuth
participant "Google Spreadsheets" as GoogleSheets
participant "Data Packager" as Packager

User -> Platform: Select "Import Data"
activate Platform

Platform -> User: Show data source options
activate User

User -> Platform: Select "Google Spreadsheet"
deactivate User

Platform -> GoogleAuth: Request authentication
activate GoogleAuth

GoogleAuth -> User: Authenticate
activate User

User -> GoogleAuth: Provide credentials
deactivate User

GoogleAuth -> Platform: Authentication successful
deactivate GoogleAuth

Platform -> User: Show list of spreadsheets
activate User

User -> Platform: Select spreadsheet
deactivate User

Platform -> GoogleSheets: Retrieve selected data
activate GoogleSheets

GoogleSheets -> Platform: Data retrieved
deactivate GoogleSheets

Platform -> Packager: Convert data to compatible format
activate Packager

Packager -> Platform: Data conversion successful
deactivate Packager

Platform -> User: Show success message & editing options
deactivate Platform
activate User

User -> Platform: Choose to edit or publish dataset
deactivate User

```

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved for a Data Publishing User who wants to import data from a Google Spreadsheet into the OpenSpending platform. The interactions involve the platform itself, Google authentication services, Google Spreadsheets, and the Data Packager component of the platform. Each step from choosing to import data, authenticating with Google, selecting the desired spreadsheet, and finally converting the retrieved data into a format usable by the data packager is delineated.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story of "As a user, I want to restrict what can be entered into a metadata field" in PlantUML format, you will need to envision the interactions between the user, the system interfaces, and any underlying services or databases involved in implementing this feature on the Neurohub platform. Below is a simplified version to get you started. It outlines basic sequences like accessing the metadata configuration, defining restrictions, and saving these preferences.

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor User
participant "UI Portal" as UI
participant "MetadataService" as Metadata
database "MetadataDB" as DB

== Restrict Metadata Field Entry ==
User -> UI : Select Metadata Field Configuration
UI -> Metadata : Request Metadata Field Details
Metadata -> DB : Retrieve Field Details
DB -> Metadata : Field Details
Metadata -> UI : Display Field Details
UI -> User : Show Field Restrictions Options

User -> UI : Define Restrictions (e.g., data type, range, format)
UI -> Metadata : Update Field Restrictions
Metadata -> DB : Save Field Restrictions
DB -> Metadata : Confirmation
Metadata -> UI : Restrictions Updated Successfully
UI -> User : Show Success Message

This sequence diagram starts with the user selecting the metadata field they want to configure restrictions for. The system then retrieves and displays the current settings for that field, allowing the user to specify the restrictions they want to enforce, such as data type limitations, value ranges, or specific formats. Once the user defines these restrictions and requests to save them, the system updates the metadata field definitions accordingly and confirms the successful update to the user.

Remember, this diagram is a simplified view to help you conceptualize the process. Depending on the Neurohub platform's technical architecture and the project's detailed requirements, you may need to incorporate additional elements, such as error handling, user authentication, and authorization checks, or interactions with external systems for metadata validation.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram code snippet for the described user story. This code represents the interaction between the user, the OpenSpending platform, and the source file storage (like a cloud storage service) to automatically update datasets as source files change. You can use this code with a PlantUML renderer to generate the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant OpenSpendingPlatform as OSP
participant CloudStorage as CS

User -> OSP : Update Dataset Preference\n(Set to Auto-Update)
OSP -> CS : Monitor Source File for Changes
note right of CS: Monitoring for changes\ncan involve webhooks or\nperiodic checks.
CS -> CS : Detect Change in Source File
CS --> OSP : Notify Change Detected
OSP -> OSP : Fetch Updated Source File
OSP -> OSP : Validate & Process Updated Data
OSP -> OSP : Update Dataset with New Data
OSP --> User : Notify Dataset Updated
note over User,OSP: The dataset now reflects the current\ndata from the source file, ensuring\nOpenSpelling always shows updated information.

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in automatically updating a dataset on the OpenSpending platform when the source file changes. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the steps:

1. **User Updates Dataset Preference:** The data publishing user updates the dataset's preference to enable auto-updates when the source file or files change.
2. **OpenSpending Platform Monitors Source File:** The OpenSpending platform, either through webhooks or periodic checks, monitors the source file for any changes. This source file is located on a cloud storage service (CloudStorage).
3. **Cloud Storage Detects Change:** The cloud storage detects a change in the source file and notifies the OpenSpending platform.
4. **OpenSpending Platform Updates Dataset:** Upon notification, the OpenSpending platform fetches the updated source file, processes the new data (validates and updates any relevant information), and updates the dataset accordingly.
5. **Notification of Dataset Update:** The user is notified that the dataset has been updated with the new data from the source file.

By automating these steps, the OpenSpending platform ensures that the datasets always reflect the most current data available, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the fiscal data presented.

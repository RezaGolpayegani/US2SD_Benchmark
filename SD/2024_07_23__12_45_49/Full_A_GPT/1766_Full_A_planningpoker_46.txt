Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for ensuring application compatibility across older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Firefox 1.5 and 2, and Safari 2 involves understanding how web development processes intersect with software testing methodologies. In this sequence, we'll visualize the interaction between a developer, the application (specifically focusing on the frontend for browser compatibility), and testing tools.

Below is an example PlantUML syntax to illustrate these interactions for enhancing browser compatibility. This sequence diagram focuses on the iterative process of development, testing, and feedback adjustment.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Frontend\nApplication" as Frontend
participant "Browser\nCompatibility\nTesting Tool" as TestingTool
database "Test\nBrowser" as Browser

== Development Process ==
Developer -> Frontend : Develop features
activate Frontend

== Compatibility Testing ==
Frontend -> TestingTool : Initiate testing
activate TestingTool

== Test on Multiple Browsers ==
loop for each Browser
    TestingTool -> Browser : Execute tests
    activate Browser
    Browser --> TestingTool : Test results
    deactivate Browser
end

TestingTool --> Frontend : Overall test results
deactivate TestingTool

== Process Test Results ==
Frontend -> Developer : Send test pass/fail report
deactivate Frontend

Developer -> Developer : Analyze feedback
activate Developer #FFAAAA

== Making Adjustments ==
alt If adjustments needed
    Developer -> Frontend : Apply fixes
    activate Frontend
    Frontend --> Developer : Confirm adjustments
    deactivate Frontend
else All tests passed
    Developer -> Developer : Merge changes
end
deactivate Developer

To use this, ensure you have PlantUML set up to interpret this language. This PlantUML sequence illustrates the critical path from development through testing and adjustments specific to ensuring compatibility with older web browsers:

1. **Development Process**: The developer creates or updates features in the Frontend Application.
2. **Compatibility Testing**: The Frontend Application's compatibility is tested using a Browser Compatibility Testing Tool.
3. **Test on Multiple Browsers**: The Testing Tool runs the application through tests on different browser versions specified (IE 6/7, Firefox 1.5/2, Safari 2).
4. **Process Test Results**: The results (pass/fail) are sent back to the developer.
5. **Making Adjustments**: Based on the feedback, the developer makes necessary adjustments. This could include polyfills, CSS fixes, or JavaScript transpilation for compatibility.
6. **Iteration**: If adjustments are made, the process iterates starting from re-development or fixing through testing until all tests pass.

This diagram assumes the use of automated testing tools capable of simulating application performance across specified browser versions and providing detailed feedback for any issues encountered.

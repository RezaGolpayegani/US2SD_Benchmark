Creating a detailed sequence diagram for managing plan reviewer workload involves considering the interactions between the Plan Review Staff Supervisor, the County Services & Property Information Portal system, and possibly other entities involved in managing workloads and assignments. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines a sequence diagram for this specific user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Plan Review Staff Supervisor" as Supervisor
participant "Portal Backend System" as System
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Plan Reviewer" as Reviewer

== Check Current Workloads ==
Supervisor -> System: Request current workload overview
activate System

System -> DB: Fetch workload data
activate DB
DB --> System: Return workload data
deactivate DB

System --> Supervisor: Display workload overview
deactivate System

== Adjust Plan Reviewer Workload ==
Supervisor -> System: Identify workload adjustments
activate System

System -> Reviewer: Notify of workload change
activate Reviewer
Reviewer --> System: Acknowledge
deactivate Reviewer

Supervisor -> System: Confirm adjustments
System -> DB: Update workload assignments
activate DB
DB --> System: Confirm update
deactivate DB

System --> Supervisor: Display updated workload overview
deactivate System

Let's break down the sequence:

1. **Check Current Workloads**: The Plan Review Staff Supervisor starts by requesting an overview of the current workload from the portal's backend system. The system fetches and returns this data from the database, providing a visual or data-driven overview to the supervisor.

2. **Adjust Plan Reviewer Workload**: Based on the workload overview, the Plan Review Staff Supervisor identifies necessary adjustments to balance the workload more effectively. 
   
   - The supervisor communicates these adjustments to the system. 
   - The system then notifies the affected Plan Reviewer(s) of the workload change. Reviewers acknowledge this change.
   - Once adjustment instructions are confirmed by the supervisor, the system updates the workload assignments in the database. 
   - The database confirms the updates to the system, which in turn shows an updated workload overview to the supervisor, completing the process.

This diagram encapsulates the key interactions required for a Plan Review Staff Supervisor to manage plan reviewer workloads effectively within the context of the County Services & Property Information Portal. You can further tailor this diagram to match specific system capabilities or additional steps in your workload management process.

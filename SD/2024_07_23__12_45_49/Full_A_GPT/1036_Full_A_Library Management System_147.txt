To depict the user story "As a library member, I want to edit my profile so that I can update my profile." in a sequence diagram using PlantUML, let's break down the interactions that likely take place during this process.

1. The library member initiates the process by requesting to edit their profile.
2. The system asks for authentication if the user is not already logged in.
3. Once authenticated, the system retrieves and displays the current profile details.
4. The library member submits the updated profile details.
5. The system validates and saves the updated information.
6. A confirmation message is displayed to the user.

Here's how this can be translated into a PlantUML code snippet to generate the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "User Profile Service" as userService
participant "Database" as db

== Edit Profile Process ==
member -> userService : Request to Edit Profile
alt Not Authenticated
  userService -> auth : Authenticate User
  auth -- userService : Authentication Success
end
userService -> db : Retrieve Current Profile Details
db -- userService : Profile Details
userService -> member : Display Profile Details

member -> userService : Submit Updated Profile Details
userService -> db : Validate and Save Updates
db -- userService : Confirmation of Update
userService -> member : Display Update Confirmation

This PlantUML sequence diagram script outlines a simplified interaction flow for a library member updating their profile on the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Remember, implementation details might vary based on the exact requirements and architecture of your system, such as the inclusion of specific validation rules or additional steps in the process.

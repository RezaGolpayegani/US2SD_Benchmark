Given the project description and the user story focusing on a staff member's desire to manage ordinances for maintaining accurate ordinance information in the system, the following is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the systems and components involved when a staff member manages ordinances.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as Staff
participant "Authentication\nService" as Auth
participant "User Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Ordinance Management\nModule" as OrdinanceModule
participant "Database" as DB

This sequence diagram encapsulates the workflow from authentication to managing ordinances, including adding, updating, and deleting ordinances. This workflow is representative, focusing on interactions through a digital county service and property information portal that involves components like an authentication service, user dashboard, ordinance management module, and database.

To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story, "As a DB/IR administrator, I want to see a. list of all administrators for ease of administering accounts," follow the PlantUML code below. This diagram illustrates the sequence of actions that occur when a database/information repository (DB/IR) administrator requests to view a list of all administrators within the system.

Please note, this is a simplified interpretation focusing on the main steps involved in the interaction. Depending on the backend architecture, actual implementation details may vary.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant DBIR_Administrator as admin
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Admin Management Module" as admin_mgmt
participant "Database" as db

== Administrator List Retrieval ==
admin -> auth: Authenticate
auth --> admin: Authentication Success

admin -> admin_mgmt: Request List of Administrators
admin_mgmt -> db: Retrieve Admin List
db --> admin_mgmt: Admin List
admin_mgmt --> admin: Display Admin List

@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **DBIR_Administrator to Authentication System:** The DB/IR Administrator begins the process by authenticating themselves. This ensures that only authorized administrators can access sensitive information like the list of all administrators.
   
2. **Authentication System to DBIR_Administrator:** The Authentication System responds with a confirmation of the authentication success.

3. **DBIR_Administrator to Admin Management Module:** Post-authentication, the DB/IR Administrator sends a request to the Admin Management Module to retrieve a list of all administrators.

4. **Admin Management Module to Database:** The Admin Management Module then queries the Database to fetch the requested list of administrators.

5. **Database to Admin Management Module:** The Database responds with the data containing the list of administrators.

6. **Admin Management Module to DBIR_Administrator:** Finally, the Admin Management Module sends the list of administrators back to the DB/IR Administrator, who can now see all the administrators for ease of account administration.

This sequence diagram represents a high-level overview of interactions within the system for the provided user story. Depending on the specifics of the implementation and system architecture, additional steps or different security measures might be involved, such as using secure tokens or additional verification steps during the authentication phase.

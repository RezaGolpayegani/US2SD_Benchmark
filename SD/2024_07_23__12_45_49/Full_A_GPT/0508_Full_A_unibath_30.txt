Creating a sequence diagram for the outlined user story involves detailing the interaction between the system components in the process of viewing different versions of a dataset. Please note, sequence diagrams are textual and visual, but I will provide you the PlantUML code to generate the visual representation. 

This scenario assumes the system has a web interface that interacts with a back-end service, which in turn communicates with a database storing dataset versions and metadata.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Reuser" as reuser
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "API Gateway" as api
participant "Dataset Management Service" as service
database "Data Storage" as db

== Viewing Dataset Versions ==
reuser -> web : Request dataset details
web -> api : Fetch details for dataset X
api -> service : Get versions for dataset X
service -> db : Query versions of dataset X
db -> service : Return versions
service -> api : Respond with dataset versions
api -> web : Display dataset versions
web -> reuser : Show dataset versions and metadata
@enduml
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Data Reuser initiates a request:** The process begins when the data reuser requests details (including various versions) of a specific dataset through the web interface.
2. **Web Interface to API Gateway:** The request is forwarded to the API Gateway, which acts as an intermediary that routes the request to the appropriate service backend.
3. **API Gateway to Dataset Management Service:** The request for dataset versions is passed on to the Dataset Management Service, specifying the dataset in question.
4. **Query Data Storage:** The Dataset Management Service queries the Data Storage (a database) for all available versions of the specified dataset.
5. **Data Storage responds with versions:** The Data Storage finds and returns information on all versions of the dataset.
6. **Response back to the Data Reuser:** The service sends this information back through the API Gateway, which then reaches the Web Interface, ultimately displaying the dataset versions to the data reuser.

This sequence allows the data reuser to view all versions of the dataset at a glance, ensuring they can select the most appropriate version for their needs. The details like dataset names, identifiers, or version numbers aren't specified here, as this represents a generic interaction flow applicable to a variety of datasets and configurations within the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform.

To represent the detailed interactions involved in the user story of a procurement manager wanting to view the available ingredient amounts in a Restaurant Management and Operations System, here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This diagram will showcase the sequence of events from the procurement manager initiating the request to the system displaying the desired information.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Procurement Manager" as manager
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Server" as server
database "Database" as db

manager -> web : Accesses inventory section
web -> server : Request to fetch ingredient amounts
activate server
server -> db : Query available ingredient amounts
activate db
db --> server : Return ingredient data
deactivate db
server --> web : Display ingredient amounts
deactivate server
web --> manager : Shows available ingredient amounts
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows these steps:

1. **Access Inventory Section**: The procurement manager accesses the inventory section of the system through the web interface. This action initiates the process.

2. **Request to Fetch Ingredient Amounts**: The web interface sends a request to the backend server to fetch the available ingredient amounts. This involves moving through the architecture from the front end to the backend server.

3. **Query Database**: The backend server queries the database for the required information. This represents the interaction between the server and the database where the ingredient data is stored.

4. **Return Ingredient Data**: The database returns the queried ingredient data to the backend server. This data includes the names of the ingredients, their available amounts, and potentially other relevant information like expiration dates or supplier details.

5. **Display Ingredient Amounts**: The backend server processes this data and sends it back to the web interface, which in turn, displays the available ingredient amounts to the procurement manager. This is the final step where the user's initial request is fulfilled.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions between the procurement manager, web interface, backend server, and database within the context of a restaurant management system.

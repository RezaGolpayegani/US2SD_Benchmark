Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to edit a book list" involves several actors and components interacting with each other within the CLMS. Here's a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library Web Interface" as WebInterface
database "CLMS Database" as Database
participant "Book Management Module" as BookModule

Librarian -> WebInterface: Access Book Management
activate Webinterface

WebInterface -> BookModule: Request Book List
activate BookModule

BookModule -> Database: Query Existing Books
activate Database
Database --> BookModule: Return Book List
deactivate Database

BookModule --> WebInterface: Show Book List

### Explanation:

1. **Librarian initiates the process**: The sequence begins with the librarian accessing the Library Web Interface to edit the book list.
   
2. **Requesting book list**: Through the Library Web Interface, a request is made to the Book Management Module to retrieve the list of books.

3. **Database query**: The Book Management Module queries the CLMS Database for the existing books and retrieves the list of books.

4. **Display book list**: The retrieved book list is displayed to the librarian via the Web Interface.

5. **Selecting a book to edit**: The librarian selects a book from the list to edit. This action is captured by the Library Web Interface.

6. **Sending edit request**: The selected book's details (Book ID) along with the requested edits are sent to the Book Management Module.

7. **Updating book details in the database**: The Book Management Module processes the request and updates the book details in the CLMS Database.

8. **Confirmation**: Upon successful update, a confirmation of the edit is sent back to the librarian through the Book Management Module and the Library Web Interface.

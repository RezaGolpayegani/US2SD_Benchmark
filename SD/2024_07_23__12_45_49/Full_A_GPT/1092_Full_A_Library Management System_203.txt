Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the "Create Paying Subscriptions" user story involves depicting the interactions between different system components and actors in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Given PlantUML's syntax, let's outline a sequence diagram that represents these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "Subscription Management Interface" as SMI
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Payment Module" as PM
participant "Notification Service" as NS

== Creating Paying Subscriptions ==

M -> SMI: Access Subscription Management
activate SMI

SMI -> DB: Retrieve existing subscription plans
activate DB
DB --> SMI: Subscription plans
deactivate DB

SMI --> M: Display subscription plans
M -> SMI: Select to create new subscription
activate SMI
M -> SMI: Provide subscription details
activate SMI

SMI -> DB: Save new subscription plan
activate DB
DB --> SMI: Confirmation
deactivate DB

SMI --> M: Display confirmation message
deactivate SMI

== Integrating Payment for Subscription ==

M -> PM: Configure payment options
activate PM

PM -> DB: Update payment settings for subscription
activate DB
DB --> PM: Confirmation
deactivate DB

PM --> M: Display payment setup confirmation
deactivate PM

== Sending Notification to Librarians ==

M -> NS: Trigger notification to librarians
activate NS

NS -> DB: Retrieve librarian contacts
activate DB
DB --> NS: Contacts
deactivate DB

NS -> NS : Generate subscription notification
NS -> NS : Send notifications
deactivate NS

NS --> M: Confirmation of notification dispatch
deactivate NS

Explanation:
1. **Access Subscription Management:** The manager (M) accesses the Subscription Management Interface (SMI) to view or manage subscriptions.
2. **Retrieve and Display Subscriptions:** SMI retrieves existing subscription plans from the Database (DB) and displays them to the manager.
3. **Provide Subscription Details:** The manager decides to create a new subscription and provides the necessary details (e.g., subscription type, cost, duration) to the SMI.
4. **Save and Confirm New Subscription Plan:** SMI saves the new subscription plan in DB and confirms the action to the manager.
5. **Configure Payment Options:** The manager then configures related payment options through the Payment Module (PM), which updates DB accordingly and provides a confirmation.
6. **Trigger Notification to Librarians:** Lastly, the manager decides to notify librarians about the new subscription, using the Notification Service (NS) to gather librarian contacts from DB, send out notifications, and confirm the dispatch to the manager.

This sequence diagram outlines the major steps and system components involved when a manager initiates the creation of new paying subscriptions within the Comprehensive Library Management System.

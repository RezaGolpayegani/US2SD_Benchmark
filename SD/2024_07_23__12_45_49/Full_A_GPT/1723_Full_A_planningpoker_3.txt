Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interaction between different system components from the moment the moderator initiates a new round of estimation by entering an item, to submitting that item for estimation. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format capturing these interactions.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you'll need to use a PlantUML processor or an online tool that can interpret and draw UML diagrams from PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Moderator
participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Moderator -> WebUI : Enter estimation item\nto start a new round
activate WebUI

WebUI -> Backend : Create new estimation round
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Save new estimation round details
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Confirmation
deactivate DB

Backend --> WebUI : New round created\nwith entered item
deactivate Backend

WebUI --> Moderator : Display new round\nand ready for estimates
deactivate WebUI

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Moderator Action**: The interaction begins with the Moderator entering details for a new estimation item in a multi-line text field provided within the web interface to initiate a new round.

2. **Web Interface Processing**: The web interface (WebUI), upon receiving the input from the Moderator, sends a request to the backend system to create a new estimation round with the details provided by the Moderator.

3. **Backend System Processing**: The backend system receives the request to create a new estimation round and processes it. It then interacts with the database to save the details of the new estimation round.

4. **Database Interaction**: The database stores the details of the new estimation round and sends a confirmation back to the backend system.

5. **Completion and Feedback**: Upon successful creation of the new estimation round and storing its details in the database, the backend system sends a confirmation back to the web interface, which then notifies the Moderator that the new round has been created and is now ready for estimates.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interaction flow for the specified user story within the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT) project. By following these steps, the moderator can efficiently start a new round of estimation for an item with the collaboration of the agile development team.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to find books by a unique ID" involves outlining the interactions between the user (member), the system interfaces, and the backend components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) using PlantUML. The goal is to depict how the system processes a book search by a unique ID.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant WebInterface
participant Controller
participant BookService
database LibraryDB

Member -> WebInterface : Enter unique ID for book search
WebInterface -> Controller : Request book search(unique_id)
Controller -> BookService : Search for book(unique_id)
alt Book Found
    BookService -> LibraryDB : Query book details by unique ID
    LibraryDB -> BookService : Return book details
    BookService -> Controller : Book details
    Controller -> WebInterface : Display book details
    WebInterface -> Member : Show book details
else Book Not Found
    BookService -> Controller : No book found message
    Controller -> WebInterface : Display no book found
    WebInterface -> Member : Show no book found message
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Member interacting with the Web Interface of the CLMS to search for a book using a unique ID. The Web Interface then communicates this request to the system's Controller, which handles the request by invoking the BookService--the component responsible for all book-related operations. The BookService queries the Library Database (LibraryDB) using the provided unique ID.

If the book is found in the LibraryDB, the database returns the book's details to the BookService, which in turn sends the information back to the Controller. The Controller passes these details to the Web Interface, concluding the process with the Web Interface displaying the book's details to the member.

In the scenario where the book is not found, the BookService sends a "No book found" message back through the chain to inform the Member accordingly.

This diagram is a high-level abstraction and may require adjustments based on the specific technical architecture and requirements of the CLMS project.

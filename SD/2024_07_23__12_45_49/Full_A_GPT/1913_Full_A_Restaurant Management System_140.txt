Certainly! To create a detailed sequence diagram that reflects the user story of a manager wanting to edit the menu to delete missing products, we'll use PlantUML notation. This sequence diagram will include key interactions among system components like the User Interface (UI), Backend Services, and Database, to accomplish the task.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you'd need to use a PlantUML environment or online tool like PlantText.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "UI: Management Dashboard" as UI
participant "Backend: Menu Management Service" as Backend
database "DB: Menu Database" as Database

manager -> UI : Selects "Edit Menu"
UI -> Backend : Request to fetch current menu
Backend -> Database : Query existing menu items
Database -> Backend : Return menu items
Backend -> UI : Menu items data
UI -> manager : Display menu items
manager -> UI : Selects products to delete
UI --> Backend : Sends delete request for selected products
Backend -> Database : Deletes specified products from the menu
Database --> Backend : Confirm deletion
Backend --> UI : Confirm successful deletion
UI --> manager : Display success message

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. The manager selects the option to "Edit Menu" from the management dashboard.
2. The management dashboard (UI) requests the current menu from the backend services.
3. The backend services query the database for existing menu items.
4. The database returns the list of current menu items to the backend services.
5. The backend services send the menu items data back to the UI.
6. The UI displays the menu items to the manager.
7. The manager selects the products they wish to delete from the menu.
8. The UI sends a deletion request for the selected products back to the backend services.
9. The backend services delete the specified products from the menu in the database.
10. The database confirms the successful deletion of the products.
11. The backend services confirm the successful deletion to the UI.
12bits. The UI displays a success message to the manager indicating the products have been successfully removed from the menu.

This sequence diagram provides a clear, step-by-step visualization of the process a manager would follow to delete missing products from the restaurant's menu using the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

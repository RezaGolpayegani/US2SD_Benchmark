Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the system components from initiating the copy/paste action of stories from a spreadsheet to integrating them into the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT). This example assumes a web-based application context and an abstracted view of interactions, focusing on the moderator's perspective.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Moderator
participant "Web Interface" as WebInterface
participant "Paste Stories API" as PasteAPI
participant "Session Manager" as SessionManager
participant "Database" as DB

Moderator -> WebInterface : Select 'Import Stories'
Moderator -> WebInterface : Copies stories from spreadsheet
WebInterface -> PasteAPI : Invoke Paste Stories(action: copyPaste, data: stories)
activate PasteAPI

PasteAPI -> SessionManager : Validate Moderator
activate SessionManager

SessionManager --> PasteAPI : Validation Success
PasteAPI -> PasteAPI : Parse and format stories
PasteAPI -> DB : Save formatted stories to session
activate DB

DB --> PasteAPI : Confirmation of Saved Stories
PasteAPI --> WebInterface : Return success message
WebInterface --> Moderator: Display 'Stories Imported Successfully'

deactivate PasteAPI
deactivate SessionManager
deactivate DB

### Explanation:
1. **Moderator initiates action**: The sequence starts with the Moderator selecting the option to 'Import Stories' in the AEPT's Web Interface and copying the stories from a spreadsheet.
2. **Web Interface to Paste Stories API**: The copied stories are sent to the Paste Stories API by invoking the 'Paste Stories' function, passing the action type (copyPaste) and the data (stories).
3. **Validation**: The Paste Stories API requests the Session Manager to validate the Moderator to ensure that only authorized users can import stories.
4. **Parsing and Saving**: Once validated, the Paste Stories API parses and formats the copied stories to match the AEPT's data schema, then saves the formatted stories into the Database under the relevant session.
5. **Confirmation and Feedback**: The Database confirms the successful saving of stories. The Paste Stories API then sends a success message back to the Web Interface, which subsequently notifies the Moderator that the stories have been imported successfully.

This sequence diagram abstracts certain complexities such as error handling, specific data formatting procedures, and the underlying technical implementations of each component to focus on the core flow of the described user story: copying and pasting stories from a spreadsheet for quicker setup of estimation sessions in AEPT.

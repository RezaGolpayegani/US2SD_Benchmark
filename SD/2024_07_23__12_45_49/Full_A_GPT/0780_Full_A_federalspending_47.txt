To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story, let's focus on outlining the interactions between the Broker Team Member and the various system components involved in adding new Program Project (PP) Codes (00***** and 00FORGN) to the derivation logic.

The sequence diagram will demonstrate the steps starting from the Broker Team Member's request to add new PP codes to their inclusion in the derivation logic, encompassing interactions with the Validation Rules Engine and Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Broker Team Member" as member
participant "Broker UI" as ui
participant "Validation Rules API" as rulesApi
database "Validation Rules DB" as rulesDb
participant "Derivation Logic Module" as derivationLogic

== Add New PPoPCode Cases to Derivation Logic ==

member -> ui : Selects option to add PPoPCode cases
ui -> rulesApi : Request to add new PPoPCode cases (00*****, 00FORGN)
activate rulesApi

rulesApi -> rulesDb : Update derivation rules
activate rulesDb
rulesDb -->> rulesApi : Confirmation of rule update
deactivate rulesDb

rulesApi -> derivationLogic : Integrate new PP codes into logic
activate derivationLogic
derivationLogic -> rulesDb : Retrieve updated rules
activate rulesDb
rulesDb -->> derivationLogic : Returns updated rules
deactivate rulesDb

derivationLogic -->> rulesApi : Confirmation of logic update
deactivate derivationLogic
rulesApi -->> ui : Display success message
deactivate rulesApi

ui -->> member : Show confirmation of PPoPCode addition

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the interactions for adding new PPoP Codes (00***** and 00FORGN) into the derivation logic by a Broker Team Member. The process involves the brokerâ€™s user interface (UI), the validation rules API, the rules database (DB), and the derivation logic module. The Broker Team Member initiates the process through the UI, which then communicates with the validation rules API to update the derivation rules in the database. The API then integrates these new PPoP Codes into the derivation logic, updating the system to accommodate these changes efficiently.

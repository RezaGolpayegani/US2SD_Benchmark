Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to delete my borrows" involves illustrating the interactions between different system components and the user in a sequential order. Given the complexity and the numerous back-end processes that might be involved in such a feature, this sequence aims to capture the core steps in this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Authorization Service" as Auth
participant "Borrow Management" as BorrowManage
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> Web: Selects "My Borrows"
Web -> Auth: Validate customer session
Auth --> Web: Session valid
Web -> BorrowManage: Request list of current borrows
BorrowManage -> DB: Query for customer's borrows
DB --> BorrowManage: Return list of borrows
BorrowManage --> Web: Show borrows to customer
Web --> Customer: Displays borrows

Customer -> Web: Selects "Delete" on a borrow
Web -> Auth: Validate customer action
Auth --> Web: Action validated
Web -> BorrowManage: Request borrow deletion
BorrowManage -> DB: Delete borrow record
DB --> BorrowManage: Confirm deletion
BorrowManage --> Web: Deletion successful
Web --> Customer: Confirm borrow has been deleted

In this sequence diagram, the process starts when the customer selects "My Borrows" from the web interface. The system first validates the customer's session through an Authorization Service. Once validated, the Borrow Management component requests the list of the customer's current borrowed items from the Database. After the customer views their borrows, they choose to delete a specific borrow. The system validates this action, and upon confirmation, the Borrow Management component sends a request to delete the specific borrow record from the Database. The Database confirms the deletion, and the customer is informed that the borrow has been successfully deleted.

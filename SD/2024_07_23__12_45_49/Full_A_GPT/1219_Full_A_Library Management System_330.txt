Below is a sample sequence diagram in PlantUML format that illustrates how a library staff member can read book checkouts from the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This example assumes the staff member accesses the system via a web interface, queries the database for recent checkouts, and the system displays the list of checkouts.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as Staff
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "API Controller" as Api
participant "Checkout Service" as CheckoutService
database "Database" as DB

Staff -> Web : Request to view checkout page
activate Web

Web -> Api : Fetch recent checkouts
activate Api

Api -> CheckoutService : Get recent checkouts
activate CheckoutService

CheckoutService -> DB : Query recent book checkouts
activate DB

DB --> CheckoutOptions: CheckoutRecords

DB --> CheckoutService : Return checkout records
deactivate DB

CheckoutService -> Api : Checkout records data
deactivate CheckoutTd

CheckoutService --> Web : Show checkout records
deactivate CheckoutService

Web --> Staff : Checkout InformationDisplayed
deactivate Web

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram represents a simplified view of the interactions involved in reading book checkouts by a staff member. Here is a breakdown of the process:

1. **Staff Member Request**: The library staff member initiates the process by requesting to view the book checkout page on the web interface.

2. **Web Interface to API**: The request is forwarded from the web interface to the backend API controller to fetch the recent checkouts.

3. **API to Checkout Service**: The API controller then requests the checkout service to retrieve the recent checkout records.

4. **Checkout Service Queries Database**: The checkout service queries the library's database to get the recent book checkouts.

5. **Database Returns Checkout Records**: The database processes the query and returns a list of recent checkout records.

6. **Checkout Service to API**: The checkout service sends the checkout records back to the API controller.

7. **API to Web Interface**: The API controller forwards the checkout records to the web interface.

8. **Checkout Information Displayed to Staff**: Finally, the web interface displays the checkout records to the library staff member.

This sequence diagram abstracts many underlying details to focus on the process of reading book checkouts as requested. Depending on the actual complexity of the CLMS, additional elements such as authentication checks, error handling, and data formatting could also be included in a more detailed diagram.

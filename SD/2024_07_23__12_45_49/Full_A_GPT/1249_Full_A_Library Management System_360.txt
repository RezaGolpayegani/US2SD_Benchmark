Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a staff, I want to update the book's availability" involves visualizing the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Hereâ€™s how this interaction can be structured using PlantUML notation:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Staff as S
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Backend System" as B
participant "Database" as D

S->W: Selects book to update
W->B: Request book details
activate B
B->D: Query book details
activate D
D-->B: Return book details
deactivate D
B-->W: Show book details
deactivate B
W-->S: Display book details

S->W: Update availability status
W->B: Submit availability update
activate B
B->D: Update book record
activate D
D-->D: Validate update

alt If update successful
    D-->B: Confirm update
    B-->W: Display success message
    deactivate D
    deactivate B
    W-->S: Show success notification
else If update failed
    D-->B: Error message
    deactivate D
    B-->W: Display error message
    deactivate activated B
    W-->S: Show failure notification
end

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Staff (S)** selects a book to update its availability status through the **Web Interface (W)**. This could involve searching for the book by title, author, or ISBN.

2. **Web Interface (W)** requests the details of the selected book from the **Backend System (B)**, which in turn queries the **Database (D)** to retrieve the book's current details.

3. The **Database (D)** returns the book details to the **Backend System (B)**, which forwards this information to the **Web Interface (W)** for display to the **Staff (S)**.

4. Upon reviewing the book details, **Staff (S)** decides to update the availability status (e.g., from "Checked Out" to "Available") and inputs this change through the **Web Interface (W)**.

5. **Web Interface (W)** submits the availability status update to the **Backend System (B)**. The **Backend System (B)** processes this update and commands the **Database (D)** to modify the book's record accordingly.

6. The **Database (D)** attempts to update the record. If the update is successful, it confirms the update to the **Backend System (B)**, which then instructs the **Web Interface (W)** to display a success message to the **Staff (S)**. Alternatively, if the update operation fails for any reason (e.g., database constraint violations), the **Database (D)** sends an error message back through the chain, culminating in a failure notification being presented to the **Staff (S)** via the **Web Interface (W)**.

This sequence diagram captures the primary interactions and flow of operations when a library staff member updates a book's availability status in the CLMS.

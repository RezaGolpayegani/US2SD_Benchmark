To create a sequence diagram for the user story of a library manager wanting to delete a book record, we will outline the typical interaction flow between the system components and the user. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Manager" as manager
participant "Library Management\nInterface" as interface
participant "Authentication\nService" as auth
participant "Book Management\nService" as bookService
participant "Database" as db

== User Story: Delete a Book Record ==

manager -> interface : Selects option to delete a book
interface -> auth : Validates manager credentials
auth -> interface : Authentication confirmed
interface -> bookService : Request to delete book (bookId)
bookService -> db : Query to delete from book records
db -> bookService : Confirm deletion
bookService -> interface : Show deletion success message
interface -> manager : Display success message

```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process that might occur when a library manager decides to delete a book record from the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

### Key Steps Described:

1. **Library Manager initiates the deletion:** The library manager selects the option to delete a book via the library management interface.
   
2. **Credential Validation:** The library management interface requests the authentication service to validate the manager's credentials to ensure that only authorized personnel can delete book records.
   
3. **Authentication Confirmation:** Once the credentials are validated, the authentication service confirms the authentication to the library management interface.
   
4. **Deletion Request:** The library management interface then sends a request to the book management service to delete a specific book record identified by its bookId.
   
5. **Database Deletion:** The book management service processes this request and forwards a query to the database to delete the record from the book collection.
   
6. **Confirmation:** After the database successfully deletes the record, it confirms the deletion back to the book management service.
   
7. **Success Message:** The book management service then informs the library management interface of the successful deletion.
   
8. **Notification to the Manager:** Finally, the library management interface displays a success message to the library manager, confirming that the book record has been successfully removed from the library.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation. The actual implementation details might vary based on the specifics of how the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) is architected, the database management system employed, and the security measures in place for authentication and authorization.

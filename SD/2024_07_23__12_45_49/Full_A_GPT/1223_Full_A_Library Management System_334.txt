To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a Staff, I want to create a book, so that I can update the library," one must understand the flow of interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This involves the staff member interacting with the user interface, which then communicates with the backend system to add a new book to the database. Here's a PlantUML code snippet that outlines this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant StaffMember as Staff
participant LibraryManagementSystemUI as UI
participant LibraryServer as Server
participant Database as DB

Staff->UI: Access book creation form
activate UI
UI-->Staff: Display book creation form

Staff->UI: Submit new book details (title, author, etc.)
activate UI

UI->Server: Request to create new book with submitted details
activate Server

Server->DB: Insert new book record
activate DB
DB-->Server: Return success message
deactivate DB

Server-->UI: Book creation success
deactivate Server

UI-->Staff: Display book creation success message
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

To use this code:

1. Copy the provided code.
2. Paste it into a PlantUML editor or use an online PlantUML editor.
3. Generate the diagram.

This sequence diagram starts with the staff member accessing the book creation form through the Library Management System's UI. After filling out the form with the new book's details (such as title, author, publication date, etc.), the staff member submits this information. The UI then requests the server to create a new book with these details, and the server interacts with the database to insert the new book record. Finally, a success message is relayed back to the staff member through the chain from the database to the server, from the server to the UI, and finally from the UI to the staff member.

This flow assumes a straightforward process for adding a book to the library's catalog through the Comprehensive Library Management System. Depending on the system's complexity and additional features (like validation checks, categorization, or additional metadata entry), more steps could be added to this diagram.

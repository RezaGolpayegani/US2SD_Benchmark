To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a chef, I want to see the feedbacks" using Plant UML, you should visualize the flow of actions and interactions between the system components, from the moment the chef requests to see feedbacks to the point where the feedbacks are displayed. Here's an illustrative example of how this might look in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant ChefInterface as Chef
participant FeedbackModule as Feedback
participant Database as DB

title Chef Views Feedbacks Sequence Diagram

Chef -> Feedback: Request feedbacks
activate Chef
activate Feedback

Feedback -> DB: Query feedbacks
activate DB

DB --> Feedback: Return feedbacks list
deactivate DB

Feedback --> Chef: Display feedbacks
deactivate Feedback
deactivate Chef

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. **ChefInterface (Chef)**: Represents the user interface or the point of interaction for the chef. This is where the action to view feedbacks is initiated.
2. **FeedbackModule (Feedback)**: Symbolizes the system's feedback management module that processes the request to view feedbacks. This could be part of the backend server-side logic handled by Node.js with Express, as indicated in the technology stack.
3. **Database (DB)**: Depicts the database, whether it's MongoDB or PostgreSQL, where feedback from customers is stored.

The flow begins when the chef initiates a request to see feedbacks via the ChefInterface. The request is then processed by the FeedbackModule, which, in turn, queries the Database for the list of feedbacks. The Database retrieves and returns this list back to the FeedbackModule, which then sends it to the ChefInterface to be displayed to the chef.

Keep in mind, this is a basic representation. Depending on the complexity of the system and the way feedback is managed and stored, additional steps or alternative paths could be included, such as error handling routines, authorization checks to ensure only authorized personnel (like chefs) can access feedbacks, and formatting processes to present the feedback in a user-friendly manner.

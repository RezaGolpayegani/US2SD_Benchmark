Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to attach multiple files at once to a log book page" involves showing the interactions between the user, user interface, and backend systems that enable the bulk uploading of files. Below is a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format, which describes the process.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor User
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "File Upload Service" as UploadService
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Logbook Service" as Logbook
database "File Storage" as Storage

User -> UI: Selects multiple files
UI -> UploadService: Initiates file upload
loop for each file
    UploadService -> Storage: Stores file
    Storage --> UploadService: Confirm file stored
end
UploadService -> Logbook: Attaches files to logbook page
Logbook -> DB: Updates logbook metadata
DB --> Logbook: Confirm update
Logbook --> UploadService: Attachments successful
UploadService --> UI: Display upload success message
UI --> User: Shows success message & updated logbook page
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps from when a user selects multiple files for attachment until the process is completed and a success message is displayed. The interactions include storing the files in a file storage system, updating the database with new logbook metadata, and notifying the user of the status of their action. This view provides a basic outline, and specifics may vary based on the actual implementation details of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project.

Note: To visualize this diagram, you will need access to a PlantUML processor, which can be found in various online tools or integrated development environments (IDEs) that support PlantUML.

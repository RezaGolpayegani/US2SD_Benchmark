To achieve a sequence diagram for this user story using PlantUML syntax, we will focus on key interactions that occur when a faculty member wants to associate files with their scholarly works. The process involves several actors and systems, including the faculty member, the digital repository system interface, the content management system (CMS), and potentially a database where files and metadata are stored.

Below is a basic PlantUML sequence diagram for your user story. This example focuses on the steps involved from the faculty member deciding to associate files with a scholarly work, uploading those files, and the system processing and linking these files to the specific work.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as FM
participant "Repository Interface" as UI
participant "Content Management" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB

FM -> UI : Navigate to "Associate Files"
UI -> FM : Display "Upload Files" option
FM -> UI : Selects files and scholarly work
UI -> CMS : Prepare file metadata and association
CMS -> DB : Check if scholarly work exists
DB -> CMS : Return scholarly work details
CMS --> DB : Store files and association details
DB -> CMS : Confirm storage and association
CMS -> UI : Confirm association to faculty member
UI -> FM : Display success message

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Faculty Member Navigates to "Associate Files":** The faculty member accesses the digital repository system and navigates to the option to associate files with scholarly works.
2. **Display "Upload Files" Option:** The system presents the faculty member with the option to upload files.
3. **Faculty Member Selects Files and Scholarly Work:** The faculty member selects the files to be associated and specifies which scholarly work they should be linked to.
4. **Prepare File Metadata and Association:** The system prepares the metadata for the files and the association details with the selected scholarly work.
5. **Check if Scholarly Work Exists:** The system checks in its database if the specified scholarly work is already registered.
6. **Return Scholarly Work Details:** The database returns details of the scholarly work to ensure correct association.
7. **Store Files and Association Details:** The system stores the files and records their association with the scholarly work in the database.
8. **Confirm Storage and Association:** The database confirms the successful storage of files and their association with the scholarly work.
9. **Confirm Association to Faculty Member:** The system confirms to the faculty member that the files have been successfully associated with the scholarly work.
10. **Display Success Message:** The faculty member is shown a success message, confirming that the operation was successful.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the process involved when a faculty member wants to associate files with their scholarly works in a digital repository system. Depending on the system's specific implementation details, additional steps or systems (such as security checks, file validation, or more complex interactions with the database) might be necessary.

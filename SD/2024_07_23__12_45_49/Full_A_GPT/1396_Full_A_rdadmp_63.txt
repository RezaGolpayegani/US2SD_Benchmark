Sure, a sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax for the specified user story can illustrate the sequence of interactions between the IT staff member and the Comprehensive Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool), as well as other components of the system, to fulfill the requirement of determining technical services and functionalities based on the software or technology used to produce or use the data. Below is a detailed sequence diagram tailored to this scenario.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant IT_Staff as "IT Staff Member"
participant DMPTool_Interface as "DMPTool Interface"
participant DMPTool_Backend as "DMPTool Backend"
participant External_Metadata_Tools as "External Metadata Tools"
participant Institutional_Systems as "Institutional Systems"
participant Repository_DB as "Repository DB"

== Discover Software or Technology Used for Data ==
IT_Staff -> DMPTool_Interface : Access Project Data Management Plan (DMP)
DMPTool_Interface -> DMPTool_Backend : Request DMP Details
DMPTool_Backend -> Repository_DB : Query DMP for Software/Technology\ninfo related to data
Repository_DB -> DMPTool_Backend : Return Software/Technology\nInformation
DMPTool_Backend -> DMPTool_Interface : Display Software/Technology Details

== Determine Required Technical Services ==
DMPTool_Backend -> External_Metadata_Tools : Fetch Additional Metadata\n(if needed)
External_Metadata_Tools -> DMPTool_Backend : Provide Metadata
DMPTool_Backend -> Institutional_Systems : Query for Institutional\nSupported Technologies
Institutional_Systems -> DMPTool_Backend : Provide Supported Technologies List
DMPTool_Backend -> DMPTool_Interface : Suggest Possible Technical\nServices and Functionalities
D&BTool_Interface -> IT_Staff : Display Suggestions and\nRequire Actions

IT_Staff -> DMPTool_Interface : Confirm Technical Services\nSelection
DMPTool_Interface -> DMPTool_Backend : Update Project DMP\nwith Selected Services
DMPTool_Backend -> Repository_DB : Update DMP Record
Repository_DB -> DMPTool_Backfund : Confirmation of Update
DMPTool_Backend -> DMPTool_Interface : Acknowledge Update to IT Staff
DMPTool_Interface -> IT_Staff : Display Acknowledgement of\nTechnical Services Update

This diagram outlines the following sequence of actions initiated by an IT staff member using the DMPTool:
1. The IT staff member accesses a project's DMP through the DMPTool interface to check which software or technology is used for data production or usage.
2. The DMPTool backend retrieves this information from its database (possibly aggregated from submissions via external metadata tools or institutional systems) and displays it to the IT staff via its interface.
3. To determine the necessary technical services and functionalities, the DMPTool may fetch additional details from external metadata tools or query institutional systems for compatible technologies and their supported technical services.
4. Suggestions for possible technical services and functionalities based on the gathered information are then displayed to the IT staff, who can select and confirm their choices.
5. The selected technical services are updated in the project's DMP, and the IT staff is acknowledged about this update.

This sequence ensures that the IT staff can identify appropriate technical services and functionalities efficiently, relying on accurate and comprehensive data and software/technology information managed within the DMPTool.

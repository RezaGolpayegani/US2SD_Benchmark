To fulfill your request for generating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story, we'll focus on the interaction between a user (submitter) and the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS), with specific steps to handle the licensing workflow as part of deposit operations. Here's how the diagram could be structured to represent the process outlined in your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Submitter
participant "EDRMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Collection Management" as Collection
participant "License Management" as License
participant "Repository Database" as Database

Submitter -> Interface: Initiate deposit
Interface -> Collection: Request deposit details
Collection -> Interface: Display collection-specific instructions
Interface -> Submitter: Show instructions & request for files

Submitter -> Interface: Upload files
Interface -> License: Request collection-specific licenses
License -> Interface: Provide licenses options
Interface -> Submitter: Display licenses

Submitter -> Interface: Select & accept license
alt License Accepted
    Interface -> License: Confirm license acceptance
    License -> Database: Log license agreement
    Database -> Interface: Confirmation logged
    Interface -> Collection: Proceed with deposit
    Collection -> Database: Store deposit details
    Database -> Interface: Deposit success
    Interface -> Submitter: Display deposit success message
else License Not Accepted or Not Selected
    Interface -> Submitter: Notify license requirement
    Submitter -> Interface: Abort or restart process
end

This diagram outlines the key interactions following your requirements, starting from a submitter initiating a deposit, through the steps of presenting collection-specific licenses, to either successfully completing the deposit (when a license is accepted) or notifying the submitter of the need to accept a license to proceed. Adjustments can be made based on further details or specific workflows within your project.

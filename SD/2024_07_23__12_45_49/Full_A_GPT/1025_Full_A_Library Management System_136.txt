To generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story, we need to establish the flow of interaction when a library manager updates a book record. The process typically involves the library manager accessing the system, searching for the book, and updating the desired information, such as the status of the book. Below is a simplified version of the sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax for this user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Manager" as manager
participant "CLMS Interface" as interface
database "Database" as db

manager -> interface : Access CLMS Dashboard
activate interface

interface -> db : Fetch book details
activate db
db --> interface : Book details
deactivate db

manager -> interface : Select \"Update Book\"
activate interface

interface -> db : Query specific book record
activate db
db --> interface : Specific book record
deactivate db

manager -> interface : Enter updated status
activate interface

interface -> db : Update book record in Database
activate db
db --> db : Update record
db --> interface : Confirmation of update
deactivate db

interface --> manager : Display update confirmation
deactivate interface

@enduml
```

This PlantUML diagram outlines the primary steps that a library manager would take to update a book's record, focusing on updating the status. Here is a high-level explanation of the flow:

1. **Library Manager Accesses CLMS Dashboard:** The library manager logs into the Comprehensive Library Management System to initiate the process.
2. **Fetch Book Details:** The system fetches and shows the details of all books from the database.
3. **Select "Update Book":** The library manager selects the option to update a book's details.
4. **Query Specific Book Record:** The system queries and displays the specific book record that the manager wishes to update.
5. **Enter Updated Status:** The library manager inputs the new status for the book.
6. **Update Book Record in Database:** The system updates the book record with the new information provided by the library manager.
7. **Display Update Confirmation:** A confirmation of the update is shown to the library manager, completing the process.

This sequence diagram provides a visualization of the interactions involved in updating a book record in the CLMS, focusing on the perspective of the library by using modern web technologies for the frontend and backend.

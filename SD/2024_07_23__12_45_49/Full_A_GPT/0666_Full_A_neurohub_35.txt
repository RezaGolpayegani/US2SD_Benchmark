Given the user story and project description provided, below is an example of how to represent this scenario in a PlantUML format focusing on increased access for a lab administrator to support regular users within the Neurohub platform enhancement context.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LabAdmin as "Lab Administrator"
participant "Access Control System" as ACS
participant "User Management Module" as UMM
participant "Neurohub Platform" as NP
participant "Regular User" as RU

LabAdmin -> ACS : Request increased access level
ACS -> UMM : Validate lab admin privileges
UMM --> ACS : Privileges Confirmed

alt Increased Access Granted
    ACS --> LabAdmin : Grant increased access
    activate LabAdmin
    LabAdmin -> NP : Access advanced user support features
    activate NP
    LabAdmin -> NP : Provide support to regular users
    NP -> RU : Implement support actions
    deactivate NP
    deactivate LabAdmin
else Increased Access Denied
    ACS --> LabAdmin : Deny increased access\nInsufficient privileges
    deactivate LabAdmin
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes the following process:

1. **Lab Administrator Requests Increased Access:** The Lab Administrator requests an increased access level from the Access Control System (ACS) to support regular users better.
2. **Validation of Privileges:** ACS communicates with the User Management Module (UMM) to validate the Lab Administrator's privileges.
3. **Outcome Based on Privileges:**
   - **Increased Access Granted:** If the Lab Administrator's privileges are confirmed, ACS grants them increased access. With this enhanced access, the Lab Administrator uses advanced features within the Neurohub Platform to provide support to regular users. This includes accessing special modules, managing user queries, and performing system adjustments or data management tasks for regular users.
   - **Increased Access Denied:** If the Lab Administrator does not have sufficient privileges, ACS denies the request for increased access, and the Lab Administrator cannot perform advanced support tasks.

This diagram helps in visualizing the interaction between a Lab Administrator and the Neurohub platform's internal systems to facilitate increased access for supporting regular users, aligning with the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project's goals for improved user access and support.

To fulfill the request for a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story described, we need to outline the interactions among different parts of the library system when a library member looks up books and places a reservation. The sequence diagram will focus on the key activities undertaken during this process.

Given the complexity of the full library management system, the sequence diagram below represents a simplified yet comprehensive flow specific to searching for books and placing a reservation from the perspective of a library member.

Please note: The actual code needs to be written within a PlantUML environment or a compatible tool to visualize the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Library Database" as Database
participant "Reservation System" as Reservation

Member -> Search : enter search criteria
activate Search
Search -> Database : query books by criteria
activate Database
Database --> Search : return book results
deactivate Database
Search --> Member : display results
deactivate Search

Member -> Search : select book
activate Search
Search -> Reservation : request reservation details
activate Reservation
Reservation -> Database : check availability
activate Database
Database --> Reservation : book status (available/reserved)
deactivate Database

alt If Book is Available
    Reservation --> Search : show available status
    Member -> Reservation : place reservation
    Reservation -> Database : create reservation entry
    activate Database
    Database --> Reservation : reservation confirmed
    deactivate Database
    Reservation --> Member : reservation confirmation
else If Book is Reserved or on Loan
    Reservation --> Search : show next available date
    Member -> Reservation : reserve for next available date
    Reservation -> Database : create reservation queue entry
    activate Database
    Database --> Reservation : queue confirmation
    deactivate Subscription
    Reservation --> Member : queue confirmation
end

deactivate Reservation
deactivate Search

This sequence diagram starts with the library member entering search criteria in the search interface. The search system then queries the library database for books matching the criteria, and the results are displayed to the member. The member selects a book to see if it's available for reservation. The reservation system checks the book's availability with the database. If available, the member can place a reservation, which is then recorded in the database, and a confirmation is sent back to the member. If the book is already reserved or loan Ilan, the system shows the next available date and allows the member to reserve for that date instead.

This structure provides a high-level overview. In a real-world implementation, the sequence might involve more intricate details, especially concerning error handling, user authentication, and interface dynamics.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described User Story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interaction between the user (Older Person) and ALFRED, focusing on receiving information through speech technology. Below is a simple example of what this could look like:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Older Person" as user
participant "Microphone" as mic
participant "ALFRED Speech Recognition" as asr
participant "ALFRED Core System" as acs
participant "Information Database" as idb
participant "ALFRED Speech Synthesis" as ass
participant "Speaker" as spk

user -> mic : Speaks Request
mic -> asr : Converts Speech to Text
asr -> acs : Sends Text Request
acs -> idb : Fetch Information
idb --> acs : Return Information
acs -> ass : Convert Information to Speech
ass -> spk : Plays Response
spk -> user : Delivers Information by Speech
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Older Person Speaks Request:** The user initiates the interaction by speaking a request into the device's microphone. This could be a query about the weather, the time of their next medication, or asking for a news update.

2. **Microphone Converts Speech to Text:** The microphone captures the audio and forwards it to the ALFRED Speech Recognition system.

3. **ALFRED Speech Recognition Processes Request:** The speech recognition subsystem processes the audio, converting the speech into a text-based request.

4. **Request Sent to ALFRED Core System:** The text request is then sent to the ALFRED Core System for processing. 

5. **Fetch Required Information:** The core system queries the Information Database to retrieve the requested information or executes the necessary command (e.g., checking an agenda, looking up weather data).

6. **Information Retrieved:** The requested information is retrieved from the database and returned to the core system.

7. **Convert Information to Speech:** The ALFRED Core System then sends the information to the Speech Synthesis subsystem to be converted back into speech.

8. **Plays Response Through the Speaker:** Finally, the synthesized speech is played through the device's speaker, providing the user with the requested information audibly.

9. **Older Person Receives Information:** The Older Person receives the spoken information through the device's speaker, completing the interaction loop.

This diagram succinctly illustrates the sequential interaction between an older person and ALFRED when requesting and receiving information using speech technology. Remember, this is a simplified model; actual implementations might involve more complexity, especially dealing with error handling, privacy checks, and user authentication to ensure secure and personalized interactions.

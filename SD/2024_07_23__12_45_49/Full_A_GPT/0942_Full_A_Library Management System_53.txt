To illustrate the sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to edit details about books" using Plant UML format, it's important to outline the major steps involved in this process:

1. **Librarian Authentication**: The librarian logs in to the system.
2. **Search for Book**: The librarian searches for the book that they want to edit.
3. **Select Book**: The system displays search results, and the librarian selects the book to edit.
4. **Fetch Book Details**: The system fetches the details of the selected book for editing.
5. **Edit Book Details**: The librarian edits the details and submits the changes.
6. **Validation & Save**: The system validates the changes and saves the updated book details.
7. **Confirmation**: The system sends a confirmation to the librarian.

Below is the Plant UML code to create a sequence diagram for this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library System" as System
database "Database" as DB

== Authentication ==
Librarian -> System : Log in

== Editing Book Details ==
Librarian -> System : Search for book by title/ID
System -> DB : Fetch book list
DB -> System : Return book list
System --> Librarian : Display search results

Librarian -> System : Select book to edit
System -> DB : Fetch book details for selected book
DB -> System : Return book details
System --> Librarian : Show book details

Librarian -> System : Edit book details and submit
System -> System : Validate edited details
alt Validation Success
    System -> DB : Update book details in database
    DB --> System : Confirm update
    System --> Librarian : Display success message
else Validation Fail
    System --> Librarian : Display error message
end

To use this Plant UML code:
1. Copy the provided Plant UML code.
2. Use a Plant UML editor or an online tool that supports Plant UML, such as the official Plant UML web server, or integrated development environments (IDEs) that have Plant UML plugins.
3. Paste the code into the tool to generate the sequence diagram.

This sequence diagram focuses on the steps a librarian would take to edit book details within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), assuming a straightforward process. Keep in mind, depending on the specific requirements and existing subsystems (e.g., detailed authentication processes or advanced validation logic), the sequence might need further elaboration or adjustment.

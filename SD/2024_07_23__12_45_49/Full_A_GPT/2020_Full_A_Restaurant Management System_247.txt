Given the complexity of creating a detailed sequence diagram in text format for a user story about a restaurant manager wanting to know the number of orders for each day, I'll describe how it might look in PlantUML syntax. This approach assumes familiarity with the basic components of a UML sequence diagram, such as actors, system boundaries, controls, and databases.

For this scenario, let's define the interaction between the restaurant manager and the system starting from the moment the manager requests the daily order report until the system presents the data.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as "Restaurant Manager"
boundary System as "Restaurant Management\nand Operations System"
control Reporting as "Reporting Controller"
database DB as "Database"

Manager -> System : Request daily orders report
activate System

System -> Reporting : Gather orders data
activate Reporting

Reporting -> DB : Query order by date
activate DB
DB --> Reporting : Return orders data
deactivate DB

Reporting --> System : Compile report
deactivate Reporting

System --> Manager : Display orders report
deactivate System
@enduml
```

Explanation of Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Restaurant Manager Requests Daily Orders Report**: The restaurant manager initiates the process by requesting a report on the daily orders from the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **System Processes Request**: The system receives the request and tasks the Reporting Controller with gathering the necessary orders data.

3. **Reporting Controller Queries Database**: The Reporting Controller queries the database for orders by date. This step involves fetching all orders that were placed within the specific day(s) the manager is interested in.

4. **Database Returns Orders Data**: The database processes the query and returns the relevant orders data back to the Reporting Controller.

5. **Reporting Controller Compiles Report**: With the obtained data, the Reporting Controller compiles a report detailing the number of orders for each specified day.

6. **System Displays Orders Report to Manager**: Finally, the system presents the compiled orders report to the restaurant manager.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and can be adjusted or extended based on the system's architecture and the technologies involved. For example, if authentication is required for the manager to access reports, an additional interaction for authentication could be included before the report request is processed.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a cook, I want to specify estimated cook prompt time for items, so that customers are informed before they order" involves illustrating how different components of the system interact to achieve this functionality. This sequence will involve the cook, the system's backend, and possibly the frontend where the customer makes an order.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant CustomerUI
participant SystemAPI
participant BackendServer
participant Database

== Cook Updates Estimated Cook Time ==
Cook -> BackendServer: Login
BackendServer --> Cook: Authentication success

Cook -> BackendServer: Request to update dish with new cook time
BackendServer -> Database: Process update request
Database --> BackendServer: Update confirmed

BackendServer --> Cook: Update successful

== Customer Places Order ==
CustomerUI -> SystemAPI: Request menu
SystemAPI -> BackendServer: Fetch menu with cook times
BackendServer -> Database: Get menu items and cook times
Database --> BackendServer: Return menu data
BackendServer --> SystemAPI: Menu data with cook times
SystemAPI --> CustomerUI: Display menu with estimated times

CustomerUI -> SystemAPI: Place order with selected items
SystemAPI -> BackendServer: Process order
BackendServer -> Database: Record new order
Database --> BackendServer: Order confirmation
BackendServer --> SystemAPI: Order placed successfully
SystemAPI --> CustomerUI: Display order confirmation and wait times

This sequence starts with the cook logging into the system and updating the cook time for an item, which then shows how this updated information is processed and stored in the database. The sequence continues with a customer accessing the menu, which now includes the updated cook times, and placing an order. The communication between each component is aimed to clarify the flow and ensure the customer is informed of the cook time before finalizing their order. This setup assumes a web or app-based platform where cooks have administrative privileges to update menu items and customers interact through a separate UI layer.

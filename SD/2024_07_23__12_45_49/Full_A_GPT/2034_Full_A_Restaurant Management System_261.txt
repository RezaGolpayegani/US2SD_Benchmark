Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story "As a restaurant manager, I want to see weekly reports" involves illustrating how different components of the System interact for generating weekly reports. Below is a simple representation of how this interaction might occur within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This example assumes the manager initiates a request for weekly reports which then involves querying the database, generating the report, and finally presenting it to the manager.

Please note, this is a basic outline. Depending on the complexity and exact features of the system, more actors (like a Reports Generator Service) and interactions may be needed.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant Interface as UI
participant Server as S
participant Database as D
actor System

title Weekly Reports Generation Sequence

M -> UI: Request Weekly Reports
UI -> S: GetWeeklyReports()
activate S
S -> D: Query Reports Data(week)
activate D
D --> S: Return Reports Data
deactivate D
S -> S: Process Reports Data
S --> UI: Show Reports Data
activate UI
UI -> M: Display Weekly Reports
deactivate S
deactivate UI

### Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Manager to Interface**: The sequence begins when the restaurant manager requests weekly reports, possibly by clicking a button or selecting an option in the user interface (UI).

2. **Interface to Server**: The UI forwards this request to the server by calling a function like `GetWeeklyReports()`, indicating the action to generate or retrieve the weekly reports.

3. **Server to Database**: The server processes this request and then queries the database for the required data to generate these reports. This involves passing a query that specifically asks for data relevant to the timeframe of the last week.

4. **Database to Server**: The database processes the query and returns the data for the specified week back to the server.

5. **Server to Server**: Upon receiving the data from the database, the server processes or generates the weekly reports. This could involve aggregating sales data, computing employee performance metrics, summarizing customer feedback, etc., depending on what the weekly reports are meant to include.

6. **Server to Interface**: The server then sends the processed reports data back to the UI, which involves data handling and possibly formatting for display purposes.

7. **Interface to Manager**: Finally, the UI presents the weekly reports to the manager, completing the sequence. This could be in the form of downloadable documents, interactive web pages, or embedded within the application dashboard for immediate review.

This sequence diagram provides a simplified view of the process for generating and displaying weekly reports in the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Depending on the system's architecture and design, additional steps or components might be involved.

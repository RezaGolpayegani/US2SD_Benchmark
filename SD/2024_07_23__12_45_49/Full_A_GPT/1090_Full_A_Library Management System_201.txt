Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: "As a manager, I want to update the employee information" in the context of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This scenario assumes the manager initiates the update process via a web-based interface, interacts with a backend server, which then updates the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Server" as server
database "Database" as database

== Update Employee Information ==

manager -> webInterface : Access employee update form
webInterface -> server : Request current employee data

server -> database : Retrieve employee data
database -> server : Employee data

server -> webInterface : Show employee data
webInterface -> manager : Display employee data

manager -> webInterface : Submit updated data
webInterface -> server : UpdateEmployeeData(employeeID, newData)

alt Validation Success
    server -> server : Validate new data

    server -> database : Update data in Employee table
    database -> server : Confirmation(Updated)

    server -> webInterface : Show success message
    webInterface -> manager : Display update success
else Validation Fail
    server -> webInterface : Show failure message(Error)
    webInterface -> manager : Display update failure
end

### Explanation:

- **Actor (Manager):** This represents the library manager who wishes to update employee information.

- **Web Interface:** The user interface through which the manager interacts with the system. It displays the employee information update form and communicates with the server.

- **Server:** This component handles the logic behind retrieving and updating the employee data. It communicates with both the web interface and the database.

- **Database:** The repository where all employee data is stored. It processes queries to retrieve and update the specified employee's information.

- **Process Flow:**

    1. **Access Employee Update Form:** The manager starts the process by accessing the form designed to update employee information.
    2. **Retrieve Current Employee Data:** The server fetches the current data of the employee from the database to be displayed to the manager.
    3. **Display Employee Data:** The retrieved data is displayed to the manager, allowing them to see what info needs to be updated.
    4. **Submit Updated Data:** After making the necessary changes, the manager submits the updated information.
    5. **Validate New Data:** Before updating, the server validates the new data to ensure it adheres to the systemâ€™s requirements.
    6. **Update Process:** If validation succeeds, the database updates the employee information; if it fails, the system alerts the manager.

This sequence diagram highlights the standard flow of updating employee information in the system, with the server performing validation to ensure data integrity.

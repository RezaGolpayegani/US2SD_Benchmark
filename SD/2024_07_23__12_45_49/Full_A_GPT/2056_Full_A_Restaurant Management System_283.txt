Certainly, to design a sequence diagram for the given user story "As a waiter, I want to display available items, so that I can inform customers", I'll lay out the interaction between different components of the system such as the waiter (User Interface), the application server handling the request (Backend System), and the database where the menu items and their availability are stored. Since this sequence diagram is specific to displaying available items to the waiter, it'll focus mainly around the interactions necessary to check and present this information.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter_UI as Waiter
participant Backend_System as Backend
database MenuDB as DB

Waiter -> Backend: Request available items
activate Waiter
activate Backend

Backend -> DB: Query available menu items
activate DB

DB --> Backend: Return available items
deactivate DB

Backend -> Waiter : Display available items
deactivate Backend
Waiter -> Waiter : Review items to inform customer
deactivate Waiter
@enduml
```

Explanation:

1. **Waiter -> Backend: Request available items**: The waiter, through the user interface (Waiter_UI), initiates a request to the backend system to fetch the list of available menu items.
   
2. **Backend -> DB: Query available menu items**: The backend system then queries the MenuDB (database) to retrieve the current list of available items based on stock levels or chef's updates.

3. **DB --> Backend: Return available items**: The database returns the list of available items to the backend system.

4. **Backend -> Waitor: Display available items**: The backend system processes the information received from the database and sends it back to the waiter's interface to be displayed.

5. **Waiter -> Waiter: Review items to inform customer**: The waiter reviews the displayed list of available items on their interface, gaining the necessary information to inform the customer.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of information and interaction between the waiter, the backend system, and the database for the specific purpose of displaying available menu items, which is a crucial aspect of the waiter's duties in a restaurant management and operations system.

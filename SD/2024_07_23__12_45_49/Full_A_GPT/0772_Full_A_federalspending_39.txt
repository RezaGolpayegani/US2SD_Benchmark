Below is an example of how you might express the given user story in a PlantUML sequence diagram format. This sequence diagram focuses on the interaction between components for implementing the feature where FABS validation rules accept zero and blank for loan records, as requested by an agency user.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Agency User" as AgencyUser
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Validation Service" as ValidationService
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Error Handling" as ErrorHandler

== Update FABS Validation Rules to Accept Zero and Blank ==

AgencyUser -> UI: Request rule update
activate UI

UI -> Validation/controler Service: Validate user permissions
activate ValidationService

ValidationService --> UI: Permissions validated
deactivate ValidationService

UI -> UI: Navigate to rule update section

UI -> ValidationService: Send update request (zero and blank acceptance for loan records)
activate ValidationService

ValidationService -> DB: Check current validation rules
activate DB

DB --> ValidationService: Return current rules
deactivate DB

ValidationService -> DB: Update validation rules to accept zero and blank for loan records
activate DB

DB --> ValidationService: Confirm rules updated
deactivate DB

ValidationService --> UI: Update successful
deactivate ValidationService

UI -> AgencyUser: Display update success message
deactivate UI

== Error Handling ==
alt if any error occurs during rule update
    ValidationService -> ErrorHandler: Log error details
    activate ErrorHandler
    ErrorHandler --> ValidationService: Error logged
    deactivate ErrorHandler

    ValidationService --> UI: Display error to agency user
    UI -> AgencyUser: Show error message
end

This diagram outlines the process from the agency user's request through the user interface (UI), the validation of user permissions, the interaction with the validation service to update the rules, to the final confirmation of the success of the update. Additionally, it includes an error handling path were any step in the process to fail or encounter an error, ensuring that issues are logged and communicated back to the user appropriately. Remember, the actual implementation might require more detailed interactions based on the specific technologies and architecture of the Broker platform.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves depicting the interactions among the system components and the roles involved in tracing the list of revisors for an item in the repository. Given the complexity of the system described in the project description, here's a simplified PlantUML code snippet representing a possible sequence of interactions to achieve this task.

Please note, the specifics of these interactions can vary significantly depending on the actual implementation details of the repository system. This diagram assumes a general web application architecture with a frontend interface, a backend server, and a database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as "Library Staff"
participant Browser as "Web Interface"
participant Server as "Backend Server"
participant Database as "Repository Database"

StaffMember -> Browser : Select item to trace revisors
Browser -> Server : Request item revisors history
Server -> Database : Query revisors for item
Database --> Server : Return revisors list
Server --> Browser : Display revisors list
Browser --> StaffMember : Show list of revisors

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the library staff member selecting an item to trace its revisors through the web interface (e.g., by clicking on an item in the digital repository's catalog). The web interface then requests this information from the backend server, which queries the repository database for the history of revisors associated with the item. The database returns this list to the server, which subsequently forwards it to the web interface for display to the library staff member.

This diagram represents a high-level view of the interaction flow. In an actual implementation, additional steps, such as authentication and authorization checks to ensure that the staff member has the necessary permissions to view the revisors' history, might be required. Additionally, error handling logic would also be included to manage scenarios where the item history cannot be retrieved.

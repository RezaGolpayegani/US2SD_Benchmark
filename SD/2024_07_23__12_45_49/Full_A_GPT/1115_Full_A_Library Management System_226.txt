### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

- **Manager**: The library manager who wants to see what type of books are borrowed the most.
  
- **Rental Management System**: This system component receives the query from the manager and processes requests related to borrowing information.

- **Database**: Stores all data related to books, borrowings, genres, etc., and returns the relevant statistics upon request.

- **Statistics Module**: A part of the system responsible for analyzing the borrowed books data to calculate which genres or types of books are most popular among borrowers.

### Steps:

1. **Manager Request**: The sequence begins with the manager requesting data on the most borrowed books from the Rental Management System.

2. **Query Database**: The Rental Management System then queries the Database for statistics on borrowed books.

3. **Return Statistics**: The Database returns the requested statistics to the Rental Management System.

4. **Calculate Most Borrowed Genres**: The Rental Management System sends the raw data to the Statistics Module to calculate which genres are borrowed the most.

5. **Analyze Data**: The Statistics Module analyzes the data to determine the most popular genres.

6. **Send Analyzed Data**: The analyzed data is sent back to the Rental Management System.

7. **Display Information**: Finally, the Rental Management System displays the information about the most borrowed books to the manager.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions and flow of information required to fulfill the manager's request to see what type of books are borrowed the most in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a stakeholder, I want to have files adequately described, so that I can successfully render them in my contemporary operating environment" involves outlining interactions between the user (Stakeholder), the digital repository system, and possibly external systems or services for file rendering or metadata handling. Given the scope of this project for Cornell University, let's consider the stakeholder initiates a request to access and render a file, focusing on how the system processes this request, fetches the file, ensures its description is sufficient, and communicates with any necessary rendering service.

Below is a basic outline in PlantUML format, which you can expand or modify according to specific project requirements or system complexities.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Stakeholder
participant "Digital Repository System" as DRS
participant "Metadata Service" as Meta
participant "File Storage" as Storage
participant "Rendering Service" as Render

Stakeholder -> DRS : Request file access
activate DRS

DRS -> Meta : Request file metadata
activate Meta
Meta --> DRS : Return metadata
deactivate Meta

DRS -> Storage : Fetch file
activate Storage
Storage --> DRS : File stream
deactivate Storage

DRS -> DRS : Verify metadata adequacy for rendering
DRS -> Render : Send file with metadata
activate Render
Render -> Render : Process file for rendering
Render --> Stakeholder : Display file
deactivate Render

deactivate DRS

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Stakeholder Requests File Access:** The user (Stakeholder) initiates the process by requesting access to a specific file from the Digital Repository System (DRAC).

2. **Request File Metadata:** DRAC asks the Metadata Service for the requested file's metadata to ensure it has enough information for proper file rendering and to assess if the file description is adequate.

3. **Fetch File:** Parallel to fetching metadata, the file is retrieved from File Storage.

4. **Verify Metadata Adequacy:** The digital repository system checks if the metadata is adequate for rendering the file in a contemporary operating environment. This step may involve checking for specific metadata fields that are necessary for successful rendering.

5. **Send File with Metadata to Rendering Service:** The file and its metadata are sent to a Rendering Service, which could be an internal service or an external application designed to render files of various types.

6. **Process File for Rendering:** The Rendering Service processes the file based on the metadata to ensure it can be successfully rendered.

7. **Display File to Stakeholder:** Finally, the rendered file is displayed to the Stakeholder, completing the request.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction and focuses on the key steps involved in ensuring that files are adequately described for successful rendering. Depending on system architecture and requirements, additional steps or services (like authentication, logging, or error handling) might be included in a more detailed design.

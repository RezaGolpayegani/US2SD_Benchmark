Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to edit clock in and out information of employees" involves detailing interactions between different system components from the moment the manager decides to edit an employee's clock-in or clock-out information up to the successful update of this information.

Here is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Server" as S
participant "Employee Database" as DB

M -> MI : Selects Employee timesheet
activate MI

MI -> S : Request Employee Clock In/Out Info
activate S

S -> DB : Query Employee Info
activate DB
DB --> S : Employee Info Retrieved
deactivate DB

S --> MI : Display Employee Info
deactivate S

MI --> M : Show Employee Clock In/Out Info
M -> MI : Edits Clock In/Out Info
activate MI

MI -> S : Update Employee Clock In/Out Info
activate S

S -> DB : Update Employee Info
activate DB
DB --> S : Update Confirmation
deactivate DB

S --> MI : Confirmation Message
deactivate S

MI --> M : Display Update Success Message
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step interaction for a manager to edit an employee's clock-in or clock-out information through the system:
- The **Manager** interacts with the **Management Interface** to select and request the employee's timesheet.
- The **Management Interface** communicates with the **Server** to fetch the requested information.
- The **Server**, in turn, queries the **Employee Database** for the employee's clock-in and clock-out information.
- Upon retrieving the information, the employee's details are sent back to the **Manager** through the **Management Interface**.
- The **Manager** edits the clock-in or clock-out information via the **Management Interface**.
- The updated information is sent back through the **Server** to update the **Employee Database**.
- Upon successful update, a confirmation message is sent to the **Management Interface**, which then informs the **Manager** that the update was successful.

This sequence can be modified or detailed further based on specific project requirements, such as security considerations or additional steps for validation and error handling.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story provided involves illustrating the interactions between various components in the system when a user moves a file to a new location, ensuring metadata is preserved. Below is the PlantUML code that outlines these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "File Management Module" as FMM
participant "Metadata Management Module" as MMM
participant "Database" as DB

User -> Web: Move file request
activate Web

Web -> FMM: Initiate file move
activate FMM

FMM -> MMM: Retrieve metadata for file
activate MMM

MMM -> DB: Get metadata
activate DB
DB --> MMM: Return metadata
deactivate DB

MMM --> FMM: Metadata retrieved
deactivate MMM

FMM -> FMM: Move file to new location
FMM -> DB: Update file path
activate DB
DB --> FMM: Update successful
deactivate DB

FMM -> MMM: Update metadata with new file path
activate MMM
MMM -> DB: Update metadata record
activate DB
DB --> MMM: Metadata updated
deactivate DB
MMM --> FMM: Update successful
deactivate MMM

FMM --> Web: Move successful
deactivate FMM

Web -> User: Confirm move and metadata preservation
deactivate Web

This sequence diagram starts with the user requesting a file move through the web interface. The sequence then covers the actions taken by the File Management Module (FMM) and the Metadata Management Module (MMM), including interactions with the database (DB) to ensure the file's metadata is retrieved, preserved, and updated in its new location.

Note: The above sequence implies atomic transactions where necessary, ensuring consistency between the file's new location and its associated metadata in the database. Error handling mechanisms (not depicted) should also be in place to revert operations in case of any failure, preventing metadata loss or inconsistency.

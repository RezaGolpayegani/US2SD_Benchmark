Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified User Story involves depicting interactions between various entities or objects over time within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Hereâ€™s a PlantUML representation of the sequence diagram for the user story: "As a library manager, I want to know the unique identification number so that I can say to the member whether the book is currently available or not."

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as LMS
participant Database as DB

M->LMS: Request book availability\n[Input: Book ID]
activate M
activate LMS
LMS->DB: Query book status\n[Book ID]
activate DB
DB-->LMS: Book details and\navailability status
deactivate DB
LMS-->M: Show availability status\nand book details
deactivate L details and availability to Manager

@enduml
```

Here is how the sequence works:

1. **Start**: The library manager (Manager) initiates the process by requesting the availability of a book by its unique identification number (Book ID).

2. **Request to Library Management System**: The manager sends a request to the Library Management System (LMS). This request includes the unique identification number of the book whose availability the manager wants to check.

3. **Library Management System Queries Database**: The LMS processes the manager's request and queries the Database (DB) for details and the current availability status of the book identified by the provided Book ID.

4. **Database Responds with Book Details**: The Database returns the book details, including its current availability status (available, reserved, checked out), to the LMS.

5. **Library Management System Responds to Manager**: Finally, the LMS presents the response to the manager, indicating whether the book is available, reserved, or currently checked out, along with any other relevant details.

6. **End**: The sequence ends with the manager now informed about the book's availability, ready to communicate the same to the library member inquiring about it.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction down to core components and steps, focusing on the availability check aspect, which is essential to the user story. Note that in a real-world scenario, there may be additional steps or complexities, such as authentication and authorization checks, handling of unexpected system errors, and more detailed interactions based on the book's status.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specific user story "As a library member, I want to see books that are currently unavailable so that I can wait for them" involves outlining the interactions between the system components from when a library member requests to see unavailable books till the system provides this information. For this purpose, we'll illustrate the sequence of operations in PlantUML. 

While it's not possible to render visual diagrams directly in this format, below is a textual representation that can be used with PlantUML to create the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Search Controller" as controller
participant "Book Service" as service
database "Books Database" as db

== Show Unavailable Books ==
member -> web: Requests unavailable books
web -> controller: GetUnavailableBooks()
controller -> service: fetchUnavailableBooks()
service -> db: queryUnavailableBooks()
db -> service: return unavailableBooks
service -> controller: List<BookDetails>
controller -> web: ShowUnavailableBooks(unavailableBooks)
web -> member: Display Unavailable Books
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Member (Actor):** The library member initiates the process by requesting to see books that are currently unavailable.
2. **Web Interface (Participant):** Acts as the intermediary that the member interacts with. It receives the member's request.
3. **Search Controller (Participant):** Handles incoming requests from the web interface. It asks the Book Service to fetch information about unavailable books.
4. **Book Service (Participant):** Contains the logic to retrieve the details of unavailable books. It communicates with the Books Database to get this information.
5. **Books Database (Database):** Stores data about all books, including availability status. It processes queries from the Book Service and returns information about unavailable books.
6. **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence of actions follows the information flow from the member's request to the display of unavailable books through the system components.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in fetching and displaying unavailable book information to a library member in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story requires a deep understanding of how different components within the Restaurant Management and Operations System interact to fulfill the request of viewing the average customer across a certain period. Here's an illustrative sequence in PlantUML format capturing this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> UI : Request average customer count
UI -> Backend : Get average customer count
Backend -> DB : Query customer data
DB -> Backend : Return customer data
Backend -> Backend : Calculate average count
Backend -> UI : Show average customer count
UI -> Manager : Display average customer count
@enduml
```
Explanation:

1. **Manager initiates the request**: This step represents the manager initiating the request to view the average customer count through the system, usually via a dashboard or a specific report section within the UI.

2. **UI Interface processes the request**: Once the request is received from the manager, the UI Interface forwards it to the Backend Server. The system's frontend is responsible for capturing user actions and translating them into requests that the backend can understand and process.

3. **Backend Server handles logic**: The Backend Server receives the request to fetch the average customer count. Before it can calculate this average, it needs to query the existing customer data from the Database.

4. **Database returns the raw data**: The Database, upon receiving the query, processes it and returns the relevant customer data back to the Backend Server. This data might include timestamps, customer numbers, and possibly identifiers for differentiating between different service times or days.

5. **Calculation of the average count**: With the raw data in hand, the Backend Server performs the necessary calculations to determine the average customer count. This could involve summing up customer numbers and dividing by the number of data points to find the average.

6. **Display the result to the Manager**: After calculating the average customer count, the Backend Server sends this data back to the UI Interface, which then presents the information to the Manager in a comprehensible format.

Remember, this sequence diagram illustrates a simplified view of the interactions. Real-world implementations might involve more detailed steps, including authentication and authorization, error handling, and data validation to ensure security and integrity of the information processed and presented.

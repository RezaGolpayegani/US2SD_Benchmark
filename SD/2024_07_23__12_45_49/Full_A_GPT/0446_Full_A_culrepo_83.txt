Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the interactions between various entities in the system, following a specific sequence to achieve a resolution to tech support issues. Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing the sequence diagram for "As a library staff member, I want to receive a quick response and a reasonable resolution to tech support issues, so that service can proceed with minimal interruption."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryStaff as "Library Staff"
entity "Tech Support System" as TechSupport
entity "Knowledge Base" as KnowledgeBase
database "Support Database" as SupportDB
entity "Support Team" as SupportTeam
actor Administrator

LibraryStaff -> TechSupport : Report Issue
Techsoft -> SupportDB : Log Issue
TechSupport -> KnowledgeBase : Search for Similar Issues
alt issue found in Knowledge Base
    KnowledgeBase --> TechSupport : Provide Suggested Solutions
    TechSupport --> LibraryStaff : Suggest Solutions\nfor Self-Service
    LibraryStaff -> TechSupport : Confirm Issue Resolution
else no solution found
    TechSupport --> SupportTeam : Escalate Issue
    SupportTeam -> SupportDB : Update Issue with Escalation Tag
    loop Each Support Team Member
        SupportTeam -> Administrator : Assign Issue
        Administrator --> SupportTeam : Assigns Most Qualified Support Member
    end
    SupportTeam --> LibraryStaff : Notify about Issue Escalation
    SupportTeam -> LibraryStaff : Provide Regular Updates
    SupportTeam --> LibraryStaff : Implement Solution
    LibraryStaff -> TechSupport : Confirm Issue Resolution
    TechSupport -> SupportDB : Update Issue as Resolved
end

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Library Staff:** Initiates the process by reporting a tech support issue to the Tech Support System.

2. **Tech Support System:** Logs the issue in the Support Database and searches the Knowledge Base for any similar previously resolved issues.

3. **Knowledge Base:** If a similar issue with a resolution is found, it provides suggested solutions back to the Tech Support System.

4. **Choosing the Path:**
   - If a solution is available, the Tech Support System suggests these solutions to the Library Staff for self-service resolution. Upon resolving, the Library Staff confirms the issue resolution back to the Tech Support.
   - If no immediate solution is found, the issue is escalated to the Support Team.

5. **Issue Escalation:**
   - The Support Database is updated with an escalation tag on the issue.
   - The Support Team informs the Library Staff about the escalation and reassures them with regular updates.

6. **Support Team:** Engages in analyzing and solving the issue, which involves assigning the issue to the most qualified support member (through the Administratorâ€™s involvement if applicable).

7. **Resolution and Confirmation:**
   - Once resolved, the Support Team implements the solution and notifies the Library Staff.
   - The Library Staff then confirms the resolution of the tech support issue.

8. **Issue Resolved:** The Tech Support System updates the Support Database, marking the issue as resolved.

This sequence ensures that the library staff member receives a quick response and a reasonable resolution to tech support issues, minimizing service interruption.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a ReadOnly user, I want to view archival descriptions in my repository", you will need to outline the interactions between the user and the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS) components. This would typically involve interactions with a user interface, authentication system, database, and possibly a permissions management system given the ReadOnly user's specific role. 

Below is a basic outline for a sequence diagram in PlantUML format. Note, this is a high-level overview to fit a general use case based on the project description provided. Your specific system's architecture might necessitate modifications.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
actor ReadOnlyUser as User
participant "UI Layer" as UI
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
database "CAMS Database" as DB
participant "Permissions System" as Permissions
participant "Data Handler" as Handler

== Viewing Archival Descriptions ==
User -> UI : Request to view archival descriptions
UI -> Auth : Validate user session
Auth -> UI : Session valid
UI -> Permissions : Check user role
Permissions -> UI : User role is ReadOnly
UI -> Handler : Fetch archival descriptions request
Handler -> DB : Query archival descriptions
DB -> Handler : Return archival descriptions
Handler -> UI : Show archival descriptions
UI -> User : Display archival descriptions

This sequence diagram provides a simplified flow for a ReadOnly user attempting to view archival descriptions in a repository. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. The ReadOnly user requests to view archival descriptions through the system's user interface (UI).
2. The UI then asks the authentication system to validate the user's session to ensure they're logged in.
3. Assuming the session is valid, the UI checks the user's role with the permissions system to confirm they have ReadOnly access.
4. Upon confirming the user's role, the UI requests the archival descriptions from the data handler.
5. The data handler queries the CAMS database for the archival descriptions.
6. The database returns the requested archival descriptions to the data handler.
7. The data handler then passes the archival descriptions back to the UI.
8. Finally, the UI displays the archival descriptions to the ReadOnly user.

Remember, this is a generic example. Depending on your actual system design, data flow, and specific requirements, the interactions and components involved might differ. Adjust the diagram as needed to reflect your project's architecture and the detailed functionalities involved in fetching and displaying archival descriptions.

Given your request, below is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: "As a corporate sponsor, I want to display my logo on a corporate sponsors page, so that others see the company's support of Scrum."

This scenario involves several components â€“ the Corporate Sponsor (who initiates the request), the Sponsorship Management System (where the corporate sponsor submits and manages their sponsorship details, including logos), the Database (where the sponsorship details and logos are stored), and the Community Platform (where the stored logos are displayed to the public).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Corporate Sponsor" as sponsor
participant "Sponsorship Management\nSystem" as system
database "Database" as db
participant "Community Platform\nWeb Page" as web

== Display Logo on Corporate Sponsors Page ==
sponsor -> system : Submit Logo and Sponsorship Details
activate system
system -> db : Save Sponsorship Details and Logo
activate db
db -->> system : Confirmation
deactivate db
system -->> sponsor : Display Confirmation
deactivate system

== Logo and Details are Live ==
system -> db : Retrieve Sponsorship Details and Logo
activate db
db -->> system : Sponsorship Details and Logo
deactivate db
system -> web : Display Logo on Sponsors Page
web -->> "Public Visitors" : View Corporate Logos
@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Submit Logo and Sponsorship Details:** The corporate sponsor, through the Sponsorship Management System, submits their logo along with their sponsorship details.
2. **Save Sponsorship Details and Logo:** The Sponsorship Management System takes this information and stores it in the Database. The Database confirms the action back to the System.
3. **Display Confirmation:** Once the details and logo are securely saved, the Sponsorship Management System sends a confirmation back to the corporate sponsor.
4. **Retrieve and Display Logo:** To display the logo on the corporate sponsors page, the Sponsorship Management System retrieves the sponsorship details and logo from the Database. It then instructs the Community Platform Web Page to display the logo.
5. **Public Visibility:** The logo is now visible on the Community Platform Web Page to public visitors, showcasing the corporate sponsor's support for Scrum.

Remember, the above sequence is a high-level representation. Depending on the specific requirements, data models, access controls, and user interaction flows, more detailed interactions, error handling routines, and security checks might be necessary to fully implement the user story within the Scrum Alliance Community Platform Enhancement project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) project requires outlining the interactions between the system components and actors as they perform the steps necessary to search books by publication date. Below is a PlantUML code snippet representing these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Member
participant "UI/Search Interface" as UI
participant "Search Controller" as Controller
database "Library Database" as Database
participant "Results Processor" as Processor

Member -> UI : Enters search criteria, including publication date
UI -> Controller : Sends search query with publication date
Controller -> Database : Fetches books matching criteria
Database -> Controller : Returns list of books
Controller -> Processor : Processes search results
Processor -> Controller : Organizes books by publication date
Controller -> UI : Displays books sorted by publication date preference
UI -> Member : Shows searched books by publication date

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. The **Member** initiates the search process by entering the desired search criteria, including the publication date, into the **UI/Search Interface**.
2. The **UI/Search Interface** forwards the search query, including the specific publication date details, to the **Search Controller**.
3. The **Search Controller** processes the request and communicates with the **Library Database** to retrieve a list of books that match the given criteria.
4. The **Library Database** responds with the list of matching books, which is then returned to the **Search Controller**.
5. The **Search Controller** sends the fetched list to the **Results Processor** for sorting and further processing based on the publication date.
6. The **Results Processor** organizes the books by their publication date according to the member's preference (newest or oldest first) and sends the processed list back to the **Search Controller**.
7. The **Search Controller** then returns the sorted book list to the **UI/Search Interface**.
8. Finally, the **UI/Search Interface** displays the searched books, sorted by the publication date preference, to the **Member**.

This sequence diagram captures the flow of actions initiated by a library member wanting to search for books based on their publication date within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). It incorporates modern software components and represents a straightforward interaction model for the specified user story.

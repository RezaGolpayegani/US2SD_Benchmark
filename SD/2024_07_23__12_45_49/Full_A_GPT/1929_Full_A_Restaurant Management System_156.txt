To create a detailed sequence diagram for the "As a manager, I want to keep track of store orders so that I can do different calculations" user story, we will focus on the interaction between the Manager, the Restaurant Management System (RMS), and associated components like the Order Tracking module and the Reporting Module within the RMS. This scenario will include steps like querying for store orders, receiving data, and performing different calculations (such as sales totals, average order value, etc.).

Below is an example sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Restaurant Management\nSystem (RMS)" as RMS
participant "Order Tracking\nModule" as OrderTracking
participant "Reporting\nModule" as Reporting

Manager -> RMS : Request store orders
RMS -> OrderTracking : Query orders
OrderTracking -> OrderTracking : Filter by date/store
OrderTracking -> RMS : Return orders list
RMS -> Manager : Display orders
Manager -> RMS : Request calculations on orders
RMS -> Reporting : Perform calculations\n(sales total, avg order value)
Reporting -> Reporting : Calculate figures
Reporting -> RMS : Return calculated data
RMS -> Manager : Display calculations

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Manager requesting store orders from the RMS. The RMS then interacts with the Order Tracking Module to query and return a list of orders based on the Manager's criteria (like specific dates or store locations). Once the Manager receives and reviews the orders, they request further calculations on these orders. The RMS forwards this request to the Reporting Module, which performs the necessary calculations (such as total sales or average order value) and returns this data to the RMS. The RMS finally presents the calculated data to the Manager.

Remember that the actual implementation details (such as the types of calculations or the specific interfaces used to interact with the RMS components) might require further elaboration based on the project's specific requirements and technical architecture.

Given the complexity of creating detailed sequence diagrams in text format, I'll outline a basic sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format. This diagram assumes a simplified flow of an employee entering customer reviews into the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Employee
participant "Employee Interface" as EI
participant "Review Management System" as RMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Entering Customer Reviews ==

Employee -> EI : Selects 'Enter Review'
activate EI

EI -> RMS : Requests review entry form
activate RMS

RMS -> EI : Returns review entry form
EI -> Employee : Displays review entry form

Employee -> EI : Submits filled review form with consent
EI -> RMS : Sends review data with consent
activate DB
RMS -> DB : Stores review information
DB --> RMS : Confirmation

RMS --> EI : Review submission successful
EI --> Employee : Displays success message

deactivate RMS
deactivate EI
@enduml
```
This sequence starts with the employee selecting the option to enter a review via the Employee Interface, which, in turn, requests a form from the Review Management System. Once the form is returned and displayed to the employee, they fill it out and submit it back through the system with the customer's consent. The Review Management System then processes and stores this information in the database, confirming the action by displaying a success message to the employee. 

This sequence diagram is simplified and assumes direct interactions between components. In a real-world scenario, additional steps for authentication, error handling, and data validation might be necessary.

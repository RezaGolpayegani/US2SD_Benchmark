To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a reader, I want to see the number of books associated with a specific genre," follow the outlined sequence below. This sequence diagram demonstrates the interactions between the user (reader), the web interface, the application server, and the database involved in fetching and presenting the number of books available in a specified genre.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Reader
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Application Server" as AppServer
database "Database" as DB

Reader -> Web : Select Genre
Web -> AppForSearch : forward genre selection
AppServer -> DB : Query to count books in selected genre
DB --> AppServer : Return book count
AppServer --> Web : Display book count
Web --> Reader : Show number of books in genre

```

Here's what each step represents in the sequence diagram:

1. **Reader Selects Genre:** The Reader interacts with the Web Interface to select a specific genre they are interested in.
2. **Forward Genre Selection:** The Web Interface forwards this genre selection to the Application Server.
3. **Query to Count Books:** The Application Server sends a query to the Database to count the number of books available within the selected genre.
4. **Return Book Count:** The Database processes this query and returns the count of books in the specified genre back to the Application Server.
5. **Display Book Count:** The Application Server then sends this information back to the Web Interface.
6. **Show Number of Books in Genre:** Finally, the Web Interface displays the number of books available in the chosen genre to the Reader.

This sequence effectively outlines the process from the Reader's initial action of selecting a genre to receiving the book count information. It ensures clarity on how the system components interact and respond to user requests, suitable for development and documentation purposes in outlining system behavior for the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

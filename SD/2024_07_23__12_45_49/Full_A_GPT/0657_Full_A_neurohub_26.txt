Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a user, I want to make uploaded data files to be non-modifiable" involves outlining the interaction between the user, the Neurohub interface, and the underlying data management system. The sequence will cover user actions, system processes, and data validation checks to ensure the files uploaded are set to a non-modifiable state.

Below is a PlantUML description to illustrate this process. Remember, PlantUML diagrams can be rendered using appropriate tools or online services that support the PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Neurohub Interface" as UI
participant "Data Management System" as DMS
participant "File Storage" as FS

### Explanation:

- **User Uploads and Requests File Immutability:** The user begins by uploading a file through the Neurohub Interface. This request is processed by the Data Management System (DMS), which in turn stores the file on the File Storage (FS) system. Once the upload is confirmed, the user can request that the file be made non-modifiable.
  
- **Upload Process:** The user interacts with the Neurohub Interface to upload a file. The interface communicates this action to the Data Management System to handle the storage of the file. Once the file is stored, the DMS notifies the interface of the successful upload.

- **Setting File to Non-Modifiable:** After the file upload, the user requests the file to be set as non-modifiable. This request is processed by the DMS, which instructs the File Storage to apply a non-modifiable flag to the specific file. The FS system acknowledges this, and the DMS confirms the action back to the user through the interface.

This sequence ensures that the uploaded data files are securely stored and set to a non-modifiable state as per the user's request, following the desired outcomes of the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project.

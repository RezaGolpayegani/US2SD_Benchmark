Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for your specific user story involves detailing the interactions between different components and actors of the Advanced Media Identification & Discovery Platform (AMIDP) during the process of automatic animal number detection in Snapshot Serengeti by a Zooniverse admin. The following is a high-level representation in PlantUML code that outlines this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Zooniverse Admin" as admin
participant "AMIDP Platform" as platform
participant "Content Analysis Module" as analysis
participant "AI/ML Recognition Engine" as ai
participant "Database" as db

activate admin
admin -> platform : Log in to AMIDP
activate platform

platform -> analysis : Initiate animal detection
activate analysis

analysis -> ai : Request animal number detection
activate ai

ai -> db : Retrieve Snapshot Serengeti images
activate db

db --> ai : Return images
deactivate db

ai -> ai : Analyze images for animal count

ai --> analysis : Return detection results
deactivate ai

analysis --> platform : Send analyzed data
deactivate analysis

platform -> db : Save analysis results
activate db

db --> platform : Confirmation of saving
deactivate db

platform --> admin : Display animal detection results
deactivate platform

admin -> platform : Log out
deactivate admin

```
This sequence diagram starts with the Zooniverse admin logging into the AMIDP platform, initiating an animal number detection request for Snapshot Serengeti project images. The platform interacts with the content analysis module, which then calls upon the AI/ML Recognition Engine to process and analyze the images (retrieved from the database) for animal count. Once the analysis is complete, the results are sent back through the chain: from the AI engine to the analysis module, then to the platform, and finally displayed to the admin. The sequence concludes with the admin logging out of the platform.

This diagram is a simplistic overview and does not capture all possible intricacies, error handling, or security measures (such as authentication and authorization steps, data encryption, etc.) that a complete system might include. Depending on the specifics of the AMIDP, additional components such as user profiling or recommendation engines might also play a role in this interaction, especially if the platform personalizes the admin's experience or leverages machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of animal detection over time.

To fulfill your request for a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to track the expenses of the restaurant so that I will be able to track my investment," the following is an example of how you could define this in PlantUML format. This diagram focuses on the interactions needed for a manager to view the restaurant's expenses through the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Financial Module" as FinancialMod
participant "Expense Tracker" as ExpTracker
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> Dashboard : Accesses dashboard
Dashboard -> FinancialMod : Request financial overview
FinancialMod -> ExpTracker : Query expenses
ExpTracker -> DB : Retrieve expense data
DB -> ExpTracker : Expense data
ExpTracker -> FinancialMod : Expense report
FinancialMod -> Dashboard : Display financial overview
Dashboard -> Manager : Shows expenses and financial health

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The **Manager** accesses the dashboard interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.
2. The dashboard requests a financial overview from the **Financial Module**.
3. The **Financial Module** queries the **Expense Tracker** for detailed expense information.
4. The **Expense Tracker** requests and retrieves the necessary expense data from the **Database**.
5. The database provides the expense data back to the **Expense Tracker**.
6. The **Expense Tracker** processes the data into an expense report and sends it to the **Financial Module**.
7. The **Financial Module** then sends this processed financial overview, including the expense information, to the dashboard.
8. Finally, the dashboard displays the comprehensive financial health including the expenses to the **Manager**.

This sequence demonstrates the flow of data and the interactions between different components of the system to fulfil the manager's requirement to track the restaurant's expenses. You can elaborate this sequence by adding more details or specific operations based on your system's complexity and requirements.

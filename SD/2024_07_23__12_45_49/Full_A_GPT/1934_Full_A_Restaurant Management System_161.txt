Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to know the total sales and total profit so that I can determine the salaries of all employees" involves illustrating the interaction between different system components and the manager user. Given the description of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, you can imagine several steps in this process, involving accessing sales data, calculating total profit, and using this information to determine salaries.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents a simplified version of these interactions. Note that, for brevity and clarity, some intermediary steps (like authentication or detailed financial calculations) may be glossed over.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Financial Operations System" as FOS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Reporting Tool" as RT

M -> MI: Request total sales and profit info
MI -> FOS: Retrieve sales data
FOS -> DB: Query sales and expenses data
DB --> FOS: Return data
FOS -> RT: Calculate total sales and total profit
RT --> FOS: Total sales and profit calculated
FOS --> MI: Display total sales and total profit
MI --> M: Show total sales and profit results

alt If total sales and profit information is sufficient
    M -> MI: Request to determine salaries based on profit
    MI -> FOS: Calculate salaries based on profit
    FOS -> DB: Fetch employee data
    DB --> FOS: Provide employee data
    FOS -> RT: Determine salaries
    RT --> FOS: Salaries determined
    FOS --> MI: Display salary calculations
    MI --> M: Show salary determination results
else If additional information is required
    M -> MI: Request additional data
    note right: This could involve more detailed\nfinancial reports or adjustments
    MI -> FOS: Process additional request
    FOS --> MI: Provide requested information
    MI --> M: Display information
end

This diagram starts with the manager initiating a request for total sales and profit information through the management interface. The Financial Operations System then retrieves and calculates this data with the help of a Reporting Tool. The manager reviews the information and may decide to use it to determine salaries for employees. This could potentially involve a further step of calculating salaries based on this financial information, which would again entail interaction between the system's components, including database queries for employee information and final salary calculations.

To bring this PlantUML sequence diagram to life, you would need a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML diagrams. Following the sequence outlined in this code will visualize the steps and interactions involved in fulfilling the manager's request within the context of the described Restaurant Management and Operations System.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story, "As an employee, I want to add a store order", involves outlining the interaction between various system components and actors to perform this action. This diagram will represent the processes from the moment an employee decides to add a store order, through the system's handling of this action, up to the confirmation of the order being added.

Given the constraints of text format, below is a simplified representation of how the sequence might be translated into PlantUML code. This illustration will cover the key steps including initiating the order addition process, filling in order details, submitting the order to the system, processing the order, and finally, receiving the confirmation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "Employee Interface" as EI
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
database "Database" as DB

== Add Store Order Sequence ==

Employee -> EI: Selects "Add Order"
EI -> OMS: Request to add a new order
activate OMS

OMS -> OMS: Generate order form
OMS -> EI: Present order form
EI <-- Employee: Fills in order details
EI -> OMS: Submit order details
activate EI

OMS -> DB: Validates and saves order
activate DB
DB --> OMS: Order saved confirmation
deactivate DB

OMS -> EI: Confirmation of order addition
EI -> Employee: Display confirmation message
deactivate OMS
deactivate EI

### Explanation:

1. **Employee Initiates Order Addition**: The sequence starts with the employee deciding to add a new store order and selecting the corresponding option in the employee interface (EI).

2. **Request to Add New Order**: The employee interface sends a request to the Order Management System (OMS) to initiate the process of adding a new order.

3. **Generate and Present Order Form**: The OMS generates an order form appropriate for entering the details of the new store order and sends it back to the employee interface, which then presents it to the employee.

4. **Employee Fills and Submits Order Details**: The employee fills in the necessary details for the new store order through the employee interface, which, in turn, submits these details to the OMS.

5. **Validation and Saving of Order**: The OMS validates the order details and then proceeds to save the order in the database. Upon successful saving, the database sends a confirmation back to the OMS.

6. **Confirmation of Order Addition**: The OMS sends a confirmation of the successful addition of the store order back to the employee interface, which then displays a confirmation message to the employee.

This sequence diagram simplifies the complex interactions into manageable steps, focusing on the main objective of adding a store order through the restaurant management and operations system. By breaking down the process, developers can better understand the systemâ€™s functionality and design the necessary components to successfully implement it.

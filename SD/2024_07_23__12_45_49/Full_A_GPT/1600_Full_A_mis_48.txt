Understood. Based on the project description and requirements, let's create a detailed sequence diagram for a specific user story that embodies the Integration and Interoperability aspect, focusing on bidirectional communication between the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) and an external system (in this case, Symplectic Elements, as mentioned in the project).

The user story might be: "As a repository manager, I want to ensure that updates in Symplectic Elements are reflected in the EDRMS and vice versa, so that the repository maintains accurate and up-to-date records without manual intervention."

This sequence diagram in PlantUML format reflects a high-level view of how objects might interact within this specific scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as manager
boundary "EDRMS API" as EDRMS
boundary "Symplectic Elements API" as Symplectic
entity "Data Mapping Service" as Mapper
database "EDRMS Database" as DB
database "Symplectic Database" as SDB

== Bidirectional Update Flow ==

manager -> EDRMS: Request Data Sync
EDRMS -> Mapper: Initiate Sync Process
Mapper -> Symplectic: Fetch Changes
Symplectic -> SDB: Query Changed Data
SDB -> Symplectic: Return Changed Data
Symplectic -> Mapper: Provide Updates
Mapper -> EDRMS: Send Updates to EDRMS
EDRMS -> DB: Update Records
DB -> EDRMS: Confirm Update Success
EDRMS -> manager: Sync Complete

== Reverse Sync Flow ==

manager -> EDRMS: Request Reverse Data Sync
EDRMS -> Mapper: Initiate Reverse Sync
Mapper -> DB: Fetch EDRMS Changes
DB -> Mapper: Return Changed Data from EDRMS
Mapper -> Symplectic: Send Updates to Symplectic
Symplectic -> SDB: Update Records
SDB -> Symplectic: Confirm Update Success
Symplectic -> Mapper: Acknowledge Update
Mapper -> EDRMS: Reverse Sync Complete
EDRMS -> manager: Reverse Sync Success Notification

This diagram presumes that a "Data Mapping Service" exists as a part of or alongside the EDRMS to handle the specifics of translating and coordinating data between the EDRMS and Symplectic Elements systems. It simplifies the process to primary interactions for clarity, focusing on synchronization requests initiated by a repository manager, processing by the systems involved, and confirmation of success.

Remember, this is a high-level overview intended for diagrammatic representation. Actual implementation details would require comprehensive knowledge of the APIs of both EDRDS and Symplectic Elements, the types of data being synchronized, authentication and authorization mechanisms, error handling, and any data transformation requirements.

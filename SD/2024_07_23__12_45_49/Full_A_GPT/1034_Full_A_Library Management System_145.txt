To fulfill your request for generating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a library member, I want to display my previous reservations so that I can keep track of my reservations," I will outline the sequence of events starting from the library member's action to view their past reservations up until the system's response displaying the required information.

Please note, this is a simplified overview emphasizing the sequence flow. Depending on the complexity of the CLMS, there might be additional sequences or steps involved, especially concerning authentication and error handling.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Display Previous Reservations Sequence

actor Member as M
control "UI Interface" as UI
entity "Reservation System" as RS
database "Database" as DB

== Member Requests to View Previous Reservations ==
M -> UI: Clicks on 'My Reservations'
activate M
activate UI

UI -> RS: Request to fetch Member's Previous Reservations
activate RS

RS -> DB: Query for Member's Previous Reservations
activate DB

DB --> RS: Return Reservation Data
deactivate DB

RS --> UI: Display Previous Reservations
deactivate RS

UI --> M: Shows Previous Reservations List
deactivate UI
deactivate M

@enduml

```

Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Member Requests to View Previous Reservations**: This step initiates the process where the library member (M) clicks on a 'My Reservations' section or similar on the UI Interface. This is often found in the user's profile or dashboard page.

2. **UI Interface**: The UI Interface (UI) captures this request and sends it to the Reservation System (RS). The UI is the front-end component through which the member interacts with the Comprehensive Library Management System.

3. **Reservation System**: The Reservation System (RS) handles the logic and processes of managing book reservations. Once it receives a request to fetch a member's previous reservations, it queries the Database (DB) for this information.

4. **Database Query**: The Database (DB) stores all data related to books, reservations, and members. It processes the query from the Reservation System for the member's previous reservations.

5. **Display Previous Reservations**: The Database returns the queried reservation data back to the Reservation System, which then sends this information to the UI. Finally, the UI presents the list of previous reservations to the member.

The sequence ends with the member viewing their previous reservations. This PlantUML diagram outlines a straightforward sequence without accounting for possible errors or the need for member authentication before viewing their reservations. In a fully implemented system, additional steps such as authentication checks would precede this process to ensure security and privacy.

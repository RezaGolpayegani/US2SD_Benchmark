To create a sequence diagram for the user story provided, we need to outline the interactions between the faculty member, the digital repository system, and any other involved components or systems throughout the process of uploading scholarly work.

Given the complexity of the system described, the sequence diagram will be simplified to focus on the key steps a faculty member would take to upload their work, and how the system processes and responds to these actions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as Faculty
participant "Upload Interface" as Upload
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Content Management" as Content
participant "Metadata Input Form" as Metadata
participant "Repository Database" as Database
participant "Notification System" as Notification

== Authentication ==
Faculty -> Auth: Request access to upload
Auth -> Faculty: Provide authentication interface
Faculty -> Auth: Submit credentials
Auth -> Faculty: Authentication successful

== Upload Process ==
Faculty -> Upload: Access upload page
Upload -> Faculty: Display upload form

Faculty -> Metadata: Fill in metadata form  
Metadata -> Content: Validate metadata
Content -> Faculty: Metadata validated

Faculty -> Content: Upload scholarly work
Content -> Database: Store file and metadata
Database --> Content: Confirm storage

Content -> Notification: Trigger content added notification
Notification -> Faculty: Confirm upload successful

== Completion ==
Content -> Faculty: Display success message and options
Faculty -> Content: Choose to share with non-academic audience

This sequence diagram outlines the essential interactions for a faculty member to upload their scholarly work:

1. **Authentication**: The faculty member must authenticate themselves to access the upload system. This includes requesting access, submitting credentials, and receiving confirmation of successful authentication.
   
2. **Upload Process**: Once authenticated, the faculty member accesses the upload interface, fills in necessary metadata (which is validated), and uploads their scholarly work. The system confirms the storage of the file and metadata in the database.

3. **Notification**: After the upload, the system triggers a notification confirming the successful upload.

4. **Completion**: Finally, the faculty member receives a success message along with options for further actions, such as sharing the work with a non-academic audience.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and can be expanded with more details or variations depending on specific requirements or system complexity.

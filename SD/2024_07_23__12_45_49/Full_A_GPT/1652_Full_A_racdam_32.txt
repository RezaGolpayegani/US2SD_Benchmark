Below is a PlantUML code sketching out a sequence diagram to illustrate the process described in the user story. This scenario involves an archivist managing scans of archival material created for educational visits, with the goal of easily finding and referring to them for future visits. This process could include uploading scans, tagging them with metadata (such as keywords related to the educational visit), and retrieving them later.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist
participant "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as DMS
database "Archive Repository" as Archive

== Uploading and Tagging Process ==
Archivist->DMS : Log in
activate DMS
DMS->Archive : Authenticate Archivist
activate Archive
Archive->DMS : Authentication Success
deactivate Archive
DMS->Archivist : Display Upload Interface
Archivist->DMS : Upload Scans of Archival Material\n(Set of files)
activate DMS
DMS->Archive : Store Files
activate Archive
Archive->DMS : Confirm Files Stored
DMS->Archivist : Request Metadata (e.g., educational visit details)
Archivist->DMS : Provide Metadata & Tags (e.g., Date, Topic)
DMS->Archive : Apply Metadata & Tags to Files
deactivate DMS
Archive-->DMS : Confirmation of Tagging
DMS-->Archivist : Confirm Successful Upload & Tagging
deactivate Archive

== Retrieval Process ==
Archivist->DMS : Search for Archival Material\n(by tags or metadata)
activate DMS
DMS->Archive : Retrieve Matching Files
activate Archive
Archive->DMS : Return Results
deactivate Archive
DMS->Archivist : Display Results
Archivist->DMS : Select Desired Files
DMS->Archive : Fetch Selected Files
activate Archive
Archive->DMS : Provide Files
DMS->Archivist : Download/View Files
deactivate DMS
deactivate Archive

This diagram represents the action sequences an archivist might follow when working with the Digital Archive Management System to manage and utilize scans of archival materials for educational purposes. The process involves two main activities: the uploading and tagging of scanned archival material and the retrieval of these materials at a later date based on the metadata or tags applied.

**Key Points:**
- The archivist authenticates with the system and uploads new scans, tagging them with custom metadata pertinent to educational visits (e.g., date, visit theme, school name).
- When the need arises to find these materials for another visit, the archivist uses the search functionality within the system, specifying criteria that match the tags or metadata previously input.
- The sequence diagram assumes an underlying database or repository ("Archive Repository") where the scanned files along with their metadata are stored and from which they can be retrieved as needed.

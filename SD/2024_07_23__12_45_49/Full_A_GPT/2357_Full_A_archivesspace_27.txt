Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves a few actors, including the `Archivist` (the user initiating the action), the `Frontend System` (the user interface where the archivist interacts with the application), and the `Backend System` (the server-side application handling the business logic and database transactions). The following is a PlantUML script that represents the sequence of interactions between these actors for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant "Frontend System" as Frontend
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database DB

== Assign Level of Description to Resource or Component ==

Archivist -> Frontend : Select Resource/Component
activate Frontend

Frontend -> Backend : Request existing Levels of Description
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Fetch ENUM values for Level of Description
activate DB
DB --> Backend : ENUM values
deactivate DB

Backend --> Frontend : Display ENUM values
deactivate Backend

Frontend --> Archivist : Show Levels of Description
deactivate Frontend

Archivist -> Frontend : Assign Level of Description
activate Frontend
Archivist -> Frontend : Optionally specify custom value
activate Frontend

Frontend -> Backend : Submit Level of Description and any custom value
activate Backend

Backend -> Backend : Validate Level/Custom Value
alt If custom value is specified
    Backend -> DB : Store custom value in ENUM list (if not exists)
    activate DB
    DB --> Backend : Confirmation/Error
    deactivate DB
end

Backend -> DB : Update Resource/Component with Level
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Update Confirmation
deactivate DB

Backend --> Frontend : Operation Status (Success/Failure)
deactivate Backend

Frontend --> Archivist : Display Status Message
deactivate Frontend

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the following steps for assigning a level of description to a resource or resource component by an Archivist:

1. The Archivist selects a resource or resource component to assign a level of description.
2. The Frontend System requests existing levels of description from the Backend System.
3. The Backend System fetches the ENUM values for levels of description from the database and returns them.
4. The Frontend System displays the levels of description to the Archivist.
5. The Archivist assigns a level of description and optionally specifies a custom value if the level is not in the predefined list.
6. The Frontend System submits the assigned level and any custom value to the Backend System.
7. The Backend System validates the level/custom value and, if a custom value is specified and not already existing, stores the custom value in the ENUM list.
8. The Backend System updates the resource or component with the specified level of description.
9. The Backend System sends an operation status (success or failure) back to the Frontend System.
10. The Frontend System displays a status message to the Archivist.

This diagram abstractly covers the process described in the user story, highlighting the interactions between different components of the system.

To illustrate the user story "As a staff member, I want to our search for Property information, so that I can obtain all associated current and historic owners, permits, and applications" with a sequence diagram using PlantUML syntax, follow the structure below. This sequence diagram will represent the interactions between the Staff Member (user) and the County Services & Property Information Portal, focusing on the property search functionality to obtain current and historic owner data, permits, and application information.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Staff Member" as staff
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "Property Information System" as pInfo
participant "Database" as db

staff -> web : Search for Property by criteria
web -> auth : Validate Staff Member Session
auth -> web : Session Valid
web -> pInfo : Request Property Information
pInfo -> db : Query Property Details
db -> db : Retrieve Owner History
db -> db : Retrieve Permits
db -> db : Retrieve Applications
db -> pInfo : Return Comprehensive Data
pInfo -> web : Display Property Information
web -> staff : Show Property Owners, Permits, Applications

### Explanation of the PlantUML Sequence Diagram:

- **Staff Member**: Initiates the process by searching for a property using specific criteria through the web interface. This could involve searching by address, owner name, parcel number, etc.
- **Web Interface**: Acts as the front-end platform through which the staff member interacts with the portal.
- **Authentication Service**: Verifies the session of the staff member to ensure that they are authorized to access the requested information. This demonstrates the system's concern for security and data privacy.
- **Property Information System**: The backend service that processes the search request and interacts with the database to fetch the required property information.
- **Database**: The central repository where all property-related data is stored, including current and historic owner details, permits issued, and applications related to the property.
- **Search for Property by Criteria**: The staff member's initial action, which kicks off the sequence of interactions.
- **Request Property Information** and **Query Property Details**: The web interface and Property Information System components communicate to process and execute the search.
- **Retrieve Owner History, Permits, Applications**: These are database actions to collect all pertinent information about the property as requested.
- **Return Comprehensive Data**: Property Information System compiles the retrieved data into a coherent format to be displayed.
- **Show Property Owners, Permits, Applications**: The final step where the staff member is presented with the requested property information through the web interface.

This sequence diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions involved in searching for and retrieving property information within the County Services & Property Info Portal as desired by a staff member.

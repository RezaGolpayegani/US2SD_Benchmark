Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format encompasses illustrating how system components interact to fulfill the waiter's objective to clear the list of waiting times for tables. This example assumes the process involves the waiter updating the system after attending to a table, thereby removing or updating the waiting time associated with that table.

Below is a simplified PlantUML code that demonstrates this sequence of events. This diagram includes interactions between the Waiter (as the actor), the Restaurant Management System's frontend, and the backend, concluding with a database update.

Please note: To generate a visual representation from this PlantUML code, use a PlantUML editor or compatible tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Frontend UI" as Frontend
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Restaurant DB" as Database

Waiter -> Frontend : Selects 'Update Table Status'
activate Waiter
activate Frontend
Frontend -> Backend : Request to update waiting time for table
activate Backend
Backend -> Database : Update table status to 'Available'
activate Database
Database --> Backend : Confirmation of status update
deactivate Database
Backend --> Frontend : Confirm waiting time cleared
deactivate Backend
Frontend --> Waiter : Display confirmation message
deactivate Frontend
deactivate Waiter

### Explanation of the Diagram Steps:
1. **Waiter Selects 'Update Table Status'**: The waiter interacts with the system via a frontend UI to initiate an update of a table's status after attending to it.
2. **Frontend to Backend Request**: The frontend sends a request to the backend server to clear or update the waiting time associated with the specific table.
3. **Backend Updates Database**: The backend processes the request and interacts with the restaurant's database to update the table's status to 'Available' or similar, effectively clearing the waiting time.
4. **Database Confirmation**: The database acknowledges the update and sends a confirmation back to the backend.
5. **Confirmation to Waiter**: The backend server sends a confirmation to the frontend UI, which then notifies the waiter that the waiting time for the table has been successfully cleared.

This sequence ensures that the waiting time list is kept accurate, allowing the waiter to better focus on other tables and tasks, thus improving efficiency and customer service.

Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to delete books in the library" in PlantUML involves depicting the interactions among different objects or components in the system to perform the action of deleting a book from the library management system. Here's a basic sequence diagram expressed in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian as L
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as LS
participant Database as DB

L -> LS: Request to delete a book
activate LS
LS -> DB: Retrieve book details
activate DB
DB --> LS: Book details
deactivate DB

LS -> L: Display book details
activate L
L -> LS: Confirm deletion
deactivate L

LS -> DB: Delete book record
activate DB
DB --> LS: Deletion confirmation
deactivate DB

LS --> L: Display deletion success message
deactivate LS
@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates the basic steps involved when a librarian wants to delete a book from the library:

1. **Librarian Requests to Delete a Book**: The librarian initiates the process by requesting to delete a specific book from the library system.
2. **Retrieve Book Details**: The library management system retrieves the details of the specified book from the database to ensure that the correct book is identified for deletion.
3. **Display Book Details**: The details of the book are displayed to the librarian for verification, ensuring that they have selected the correct book to delete.
4. **Confirm Deletion**: The librarian confirms the deletion of the book. This step may include a confirmation action, such as clicking a "Confirm" button.
5. **Delete Book Record**: Upon confirmation, the library management system proceeds to delete the book's record from the database.
6. **Deletion Confirmation**: The system confirms that the book record has been successfully deleted.

Please note, for actual implementation, security measures like authentication and authorization checks should be included to ensure only authorized personnel can delete book records. Additionally, consider implementing a "soft delete" where records are marked as deleted but not permanently removed, allowing for data recovery in case of accidental deletions.

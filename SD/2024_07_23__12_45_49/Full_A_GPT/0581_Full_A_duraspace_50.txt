Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves depicting the interaction between different system components and actors to achieve the goal of associating a content file with an object or an object component. Below is a simplified representation of this process in PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as rm
participant "User Interface" as ui
participant "Object Management Module" as omm
participant "Database" as db
database "Digital Asset Repository" as dar

rm -> ui : Select object/component
ui -> omm : Retrieve object/component details
omm -> db : Query object/component details
db -> omm : Return details
omm -> ui : Display details to Repository Manager
rm -> ui : Initiates file association
ui -> omm : Associate file with object/component
omm -> db : Update association in database
db -> omm : Confirm update
omm -> ui : Show success message
ui -> rm : Display association confirmation

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Elements:
1. **Repository Manager:** Initiates the process by selecting an object or component and requests to associate a content file with it.
2. **User Interface (UI):** Serves as the interaction layer where the repository manager can make selections and initiate file association.
3. **Object Management Module (OMM):** Handles the logic for retrieving object/component details and managing the association between the content file and the selected object/component.
4. **Database (DB):** Performs the storage and retrieval of data related to objects/components and their associated files.
5. **Digital Asset Repository (DAR):** Represents the underlying datastore that contains all digital assets, their metadata, and associations.

### Process Flow:
1. **Select Object/Component:** The repository manager initiates the process by selecting an object or component through the UI.
2. **Retrieve Details:** The UI requests the details of the selected object/component from the OMM, which in turn retrieves the information from the database.
3. **Display Details:** The OMM returns the details to the UI, which displays them to the repository manager.
4. **Initiate File Association:** The repository manager requests to associate a file with the chosen object/component through the UI.
5. **Associate File:** The UI sends the association request to the OMM, which updates the database to link the content file with the selected object/component.
6. **Confirm Association:** The database confirms the successful update back to the OMM, which notifies the UI to show a success message to the repository our manager, confirming the association.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in associating a content file with an object or an object component from the perspective of a repository manager using the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS).

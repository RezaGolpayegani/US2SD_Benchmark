Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to create pages for book information" involves illustrating the interactions between different system components in creating a book record. Here's a PlantUML code snippet that demonstrates these interactions.

Please note, for the sake of this sequence, it's assumed that the librarian is already authenticated and authorized to add books to the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Database" as db

librarian -> ui : Select "Add Book"
ui -> backend : Request book info form
backend -> ui : Display book info form
librarian -> ui : Fill book info and submit
ui -> backend : Validate data\nand create book record
activate backend
backend -> db : Insert book data
activate db
db --> backend : Confirm insertion
deactivate db
backend --> ui : Confirm book creation
deactivate backend
ui --> librarian : Display confirmation message
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Librarian selects "Add Book"**: The sequence starts with the librarian deciding to add a new book to the system, which initiates an interaction with the UI Interface.

2. **Request book info form**: The UI Interface requests the backend system to provide a form for entering the book information.

3. **Display book info form**: The backend system processes the request and returns the necessary form to the UI Interface, which then displays it to the librarian.

4. **Fill book info and submit**: The librarian fills in the book details in the provided form fields and submits it for processing.

5. **Validate data and create book record**: The UI Interface sends the filled form to the backend system, where the data is validated. If the data passes validation, the backend system proceeds to create a new book record.

6. **Insert book data into the database**: The backend system interacts with the database to insert the new book's data. Upon successful insertion, the database confirms back to the backend system.

7. **Confirm book creation**: The backend system, after receiving confirmation from the database, sends a success message to the UI Interface.

8, **Display confirmation message**: Finally, the UI Interface displays a confirmation message to the librarian, indicating that the book has been successfully added to the library's collection.

This sequence diagram outlines the process of a librarian adding a book to the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), showing the interaction between the librarian, UI Interface, backend system, and database.

To fulfill your request, I'll provide you with a PlantUML code sketch that represents a typical sequence diagram for obtaining a list of deposited assets and their current status by an asset manager in the described digital repository system. This example assumes the interaction involves the asset manager initiating a request, the system querying the database, and then returning the results to the asset manager.

Since your request is centered around the functionality for an asset manager to interact with the system, this sequence diagram focuses on those interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Asset Manager" as manager
participant "Repository Interface" as interface
database "Repository Database" as database

manager -> interface : Request list of deposited assets
activate manager
activate interface

interface -> database : Query all assets and statuses
activate database

database --> interface : Return result set
deactivate database

interface --> manager : Display assets and statuses
deactivate interface
deactivate manager

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Asset Manager Initiates Request**: The asset manager (you) requests a listing of all deposited assets and their current status. This is the starting point of the interaction.

2. **Repository Interface Receives Request**: The system's repository interface receives the request. This interface is responsible for handling requests and interactions from users, including asset managers.

3. **Query Repository Database**: The repository interface, in turn, queries the repository database to retrieve information about all deposited assets, including their current status. The repository database is where all information about assets, including metadata, status, and other relevant details, is stored.

4. **Database Returns Results**: The repository database processes the query and returns the result set to the repository interface. This result set includes information about each asset, such as title, identifier, status, and any other relevant metadata.

5. **Display Assets and Statuses**: Finally, the repository interface presents the list of assets and their current statuses to the asset manager. This can be in the form of a web page, a report, or other user-friendly formats designed for easy review and analysis by the asset manager.

This sequence diagram simplifies complex interactions and focuses on the primary steps involved in fulfilling the asset manager's request within the digital repository system at Cornell University. Depending on the actual implementation details, additional steps or interactions might be necessary, especially concerning authentication, authorization, and error handling.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the total number of members that visit the library day by day" using PlantUML, you need to consider various components and interactions that occur when the library manager requests daily visitation statistics. This sequence will involve several steps, starting from the manager's request to view the statistics, querying the database, and finally displaying the results.

Below is the PlantUML code that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Manager

participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Library Database" as DB

Manager -> UI : Request daily visitation stats
UI -> Backend : GetVisitationStats()
Backend -> DB : Query daily visit statistics
DB -> Backend : Return statistics data
Backend -> UI : Display stats
UI -> Manager : Show visitation statistics

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram demonstrates the following process:

1. **Manager Requests Visitations Stats**: The sequence starts with the manager requesting the daily visitation statistics from the UI Interface of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

2. **UI Requests Backend for Data**: The UI Interface forwards this request to the Backend Server by calling a method/function like `GetVisitation​​Stats()` to fetch the required data.

3. **Backend Queries the Database**: The Backend Server processes this request and queries the "Library Database" to retrieve the daily visitation statistics. This involves executing a database query to fetch the number of member visits day by day.

4. **Database Returns Data**: Upon executing the query, the Library Database returns the visitation statistics data to the Backend Server.

5. **Backend Sends Data to UI**: With the data received from the Database, the Backend Server then processes this data if necessary (e.g., formatting the data for better UI display), and sends it to the UI Interface.

6. **UI Displays the Stats to Manager**: Finally, the UI Interface displays the visitation statistics to the manager, completing the process.

Remember, this sequence assumes a straightforward interaction flow. Depending on specific requirements or additional features of the CLMS, there might be more steps involved (e.g., authentication of the manager's role, caching strategies for frequent requests, additional processing of raw data into insightful metrics, etc.).

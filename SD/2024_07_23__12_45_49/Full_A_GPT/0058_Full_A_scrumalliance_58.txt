Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided involves outlining the interactions between the site visitor and various components of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform system when a link in an article teaser is clicked. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Visitor as V
participant "Article Teaser" as AT
participant "Web Server" as WS
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Article Page" as AP

V -> AT: Clicks article teaser link
activate AT

AT -> WS: Request full article
activate WS

WS -> CMS : Fetch article data
activate CMS

CMS -> CMS: Retrieve full article content
CMS --> WS: Return article content
deactivate CMS

WS -> AP: Generate article page with full content
activate AP
AP --> V: Display full article
deactivate AP

deactivate WS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the site visitor (`Visitor`) clicking on an article teaser link (`Article Teaser`). The web server (`Web Server`) receives the request to access the full article, which then communicates with the Content Management System (`CMS`) to fetch the necessary article data. The CMS retrieves the full content of the article and sends this data back to the web server. Finally, the web server generates the full article page (`Article Page`) and presents it to the site visitor, allowing them to read the complete article without encountering another teaser.

This simplified sequence captures the essence of the interaction based on the specific user story you've outlined. Keep in mind that actual implementations may involve additional steps or components depending on the specific architecture and technologies used in the Scrum Alliance Community Platform.

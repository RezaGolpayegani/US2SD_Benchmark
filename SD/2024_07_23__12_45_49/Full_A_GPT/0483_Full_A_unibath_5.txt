To illustrate the process described in your user story through a sequence diagram with PlantUML, we'll detail the interactions between the depositor and the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. This diagram assumes some key interactions, such as selecting the datasets to deposit, the system's handling of file versions and formats, and the final confirmation of the dataset deposit.

Below is the PlantUML code which depicts these steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "File Version\nManagement" as Version
participant "Format Conversion\nService" as Format
participant "Metadata\nGenerator" as Meta
participant "Data Repository" as Repo

Depositor -> Web : Navigate to deposit section
Web -> Depositor : Request dataset files
Depositor -> Web : Selects and uploads dataset files

alt If files need version handling
    Web -> Version : Check/Select version
    Version -> Web : Version approved
else If files need format conversion
    Web -> Format : Convert to acceptable format
    Format -> Web : Conversion complete
end

Web -> Meta : Generate metadata for dataset
Meta -> Web : Metadata attached

Web -> Repo : Deposit dataset with metadata
Repo -> Web : Confirm dataset deposit
Web -> Depositor : Display confirmation message
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the **Depositor** navigating to the deposit section on the web interface of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform. It moves through the process of uploading the dataset files, wherein the system may need to handle file versioning or format conversion.

1. **File Version Management**: This conditional step checks and selects the right version of the dataset files if needed, ensuring that the depositor does not have to spend time finding the right version.
2. **Format Conversion Service**: Another conditional path where the dataset files are converted to an acceptable format for deposit if necessary, sidestepping the depositor's need to manually convert files.
3. **Metadata Generation and Attachment**: The system generates and attaches metadata to the dataset to enhance discoverability and manageability.
4. **Dataset Deposit Confirmation**: Finally, the dataset, along with its metadata, is deposited in the data repository, and the depositor receives a confirmation message.

This diagram captures the simplified, efficient process desired for depositing files into the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, focusing on ease of use and minimizing depositor workload regarding version selection and file format conversion.

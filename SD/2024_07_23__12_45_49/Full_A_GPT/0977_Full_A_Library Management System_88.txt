To create a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see member information," we need to illustrate the interaction between several system components such as the User Interface (UI), the Controller, the Model (dealing with member information), and the Database.

Below is a basic illustration of how these interactions could be represented in Plant UML. This example focuses on the sequence of actions that occur when a librarian wants to view information about a member.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "UI: Web Interface" as UI
participant "Controller: MemberController" as Controller
participant "Model: MemberService" as Service
participant "Database" as DB

Librarian -> UI : Request to View Member Information
UI -> Controller : getMemberDetails(memberID)
Controller -> Service : fetchMemberInformation(memberID)
Service -> DB : queryMemberByID(memberID)
DB -> Service : returnMemberData
Service -> Controller : memberInfo
Controller -> UI : displayMemberInformation
UI -> Librarian : Show Member Information

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Librarian (actor):** Initiates the action by requesting to view member information. This could be through a web interface where the librarian enters a member ID or selects a member from a list.

2. **UI: Web Interface (participant):** Represents the front-end user interface through which the librarian interacts with the system. It receives the librarian's request and forwards it to the controller.

3. **Controller: MemberController (participant):** Acts as an intermediary that processes requests from the UI. It interprets the librarian's request to view member information, calling the appropriate service function with the member ID.

4. **Model: MemberService (participant):** Represents the service layer responsible for the business logic related to members. It communicates with the database to fetch the requested member information using the member ID.

5. **Database (participant):** Holds member data and processes queries from the model. It looks up the member by their ID and returns the data found to the MemberService.

6. **Information Flow:** The sequence diagram shows the flow of information from the librarian's initial request, through the system, and back to the librarian with the member information displayed.

Make sure to adapt and expand this basic example to fit the specifics of your Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), including any additional steps or components relevant to your project's architecture and requirements.

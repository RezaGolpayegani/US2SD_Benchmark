Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story, "As a Staff member, I want to Send a Formal Response to Applicant, so that I can satisfy communication and records responsibilities," involves illustrating the interactions between the staff member, the County Services & Property Information Portal system, possibly an email service, and the database for storing records.

Below is a PlantUML code sketching out these interactions. This sequence diagram assumes that after reviewing an application or at any point necessitating communication with the applicant, a staff member uses the portal to send a formal response. The system then records this action in the database and sends an email to the applicant.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as "Staff Member"
participant "Portal" as Portal
participant "EmailService" as Email
database "Database" as DB

== Send Formal Response to Applicant ==

StaffMember -> Portal: Access application response form
activate Portal

Portal -> DB: Retrieve Applicant Details
activate DB
DB --> Portal: Applicant Email & Application Info
deactivate DB

Portal --> StaffMember: Show form with Applicant Info\n(Pre-filled)

StaffMember -> Portal: Submit Formal Response\n(Includes response text and attachments)
activate Portal

Portal -> DB: Save Response Details
activate DB
DB --> Portal: Confirmation
deactivate DB

Portal -> Email: Send Formal Response to Applicant\n(Email with response & attachments)
activate Email
Email --> Portal: Email Sent Confirmation
deactivate Email

Portal --> StaffMember: Display Confirmation Message\n(Response Sent)
deactivate Portal

This sequence starts with the staff member initiating the process by accessing the application response form on the portal. The system retrieves the applicantâ€™s details from the database, pre-fills the form where applicable, and presents it to the staff member. Once the staff submits their formal response, the portal records the details in the database and sends an email to the applicant using an email service. The interaction concludes with the staff member receiving a confirmation message that the formal response has been sent.

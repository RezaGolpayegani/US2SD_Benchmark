Given the user story provided, a sequence diagram in PlantUML format outlines the interactions between the Planning Staff member and various components of the County Services & Property Information Portal during the process of evaluating the consistency of a plan set/application with the Comprehensive Plan. The diagram assumes a number of basic steps and interactions based on the project overview provided. 

Please note, due to the nature of text responses, we will design the sequence in a descriptive manner. To execute and visualize this, you'll need to paste the following PlantUML code into a PlantUML editor or a compatible tool that supports PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml

actor PlanningStaff as "Planning Staff"
participant UserAuthentication as "User Auth"
participant Dashboard as "Staff Dashboard"
participant ApplicationDB as "Application Database"
participant ComplianceTool as "Compliance Checking Tool"
participant ComprehensivePlanDB as "Comprehensive Plan Database"
participant ReviewNotes as "Review Notes Interface"
participant NotificationService as "Notification Service"

This sequence diagram aims to illustrate the process flow when a Planning Staff member evaluates the consistency of a plan set or application with the Comprehensive Plan. The diagram begins with the staff member logging into the system, accessing their dashboard, and selecting an application to review. The application details are then loaded into a compliance checking tool, which checks for consistency against the Comprehensive Plan stored in a separate database. The staff member reviews the consistency results, documents their review in the system, and an automatic notification is sent to the applicant about the update.

Remember, this is a high-level and simplified view. The actual implementation can include more steps or different interactions based on specific system requirements, business rules, and user needs.

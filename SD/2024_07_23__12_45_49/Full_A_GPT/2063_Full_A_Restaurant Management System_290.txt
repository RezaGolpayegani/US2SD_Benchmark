Given the complexity of the described system, a sequence diagram for the described user story "As a waiter, I want to enter order details to the system so that I can keep track of what has been ordered" would involve interactions among several components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines a possible sequence diagram for this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Order Management Module" as OrderModule
participant "Inventory Module" as Inventory
participant "Database" as DB

Waiter -> UI : Select 'New Order'
UI -> OrderModule : Initiate 'Create Order'
Waiter -> UI : Enter Customer Order Details
UI -> OrderModule : Capture Order Details
OrderModule -> Inventory : Check Ingredient Availability
Inventory --> OrderModule : Confirm Availability
OrderModule -> DB : Store New Order
DB --> OrderModule : Confirm Order Stored
OrderModule -> UI : Display Order Confirmation
UI --> Waiter : Show Order Confirmation ID

This sequence diagram outlines the process of a waiter entering order details into the system, from initiating a new order in the user interface to receiving a confirmation that the order has been successfully stored in the database. Here's a quick breakdown of the steps:

1. **Waiter selects 'New Order'**: The process begins with the waiter choosing to create a new order via the UI.

2. **UI interfaces with Order Management Module**: The UI sends a request to the Order Management Module to initiate order creation.

3. **Waiter enters customer order details**: Through the UI, the waiter inputs all the necessary details about the customer's order.

4. **Order Management Module captures and checks details**: The Order Management Module processes the input details, then queries the Inventory Module to check ingredient availability.

5. **Inventory Module confirms ingredient availability**: The Inventory Module checks stock levels and sends confirmation back to the Order Management Module.

6. **Order details are stored in the Database**: The Order Management Module sends the order to be stored in the database, ensuring that all details are accurately recorded.

7. **Database confirms order storage**: After storing the order, the database sends a confirmation back to the Order Management Module.

8. **UI displays order confirmation**: Finally, the UI presents a confirmation to the waiter, including an order confirmation ID for tracking.

This diagram is a simplistic view meant to provide a high-level overview of the process. Depending on the system's architecture and specific requirements, additional steps or systems (like notification services for kitchen staff or payment processing modules) might also be involved in the complete order handling process.

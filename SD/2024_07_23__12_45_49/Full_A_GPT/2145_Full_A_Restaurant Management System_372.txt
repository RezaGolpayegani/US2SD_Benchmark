To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given User Story ("As an employee, I want to see the inventory list, so that I can prepare today's menu."), using PlantUML, you would need to outline all the steps involved in this process, including the interactions between the employee, the system's UI, backend services, and the database.

Here's a PlantUML code block that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as E
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

E -> UI : Selects "View Inventory"
UI -> Server : Request to fetch inventory list
Server -> DB : Query inventory data
DB -> Server : Return inventory data
Server -> UI : Display inventory list
UI -> E : Shows inventory list

note right of E : Employee reviews \ninventory to plan menu

@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the Employee initiating the process by selecting the option to view the inventory on the UI Dashboard. The UI then requests the Backend Server to fetch the inventory list. The Backend Server queries the Database for the inventory data, which then sends the requested data back to the Server. The Server processes this data and sends it back to the UI Dashboard, which finally displays the inventory list to the Employee.

To translate this code into a visual sequence diagram, you'd need to run it through a PlantUML processor, which can be found in various development tools or online editors that support PlantUML syntax.

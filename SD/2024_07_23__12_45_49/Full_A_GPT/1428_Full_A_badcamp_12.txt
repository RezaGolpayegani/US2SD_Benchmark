Creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story you provided involves outlining the interactions between various components of the system from the viewpoint of a trainee looking to view their signed-up trainings. Below is an example of how you could structure this sequence diagram in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Trainee
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "User Database" as UserDB
participant "Training Service" as Training
participant "Training Database" as TrainingDB

Trainee -> Auth: Request to login
Auth -> UserDB: Validate user credentials
UserDB -> Auth: Return user validation
Auth -> Trainee: Authentication Success

Trainee -> Training: Request signed up trainings
Training -> TrainingDB: Fetch trainings for user
TrainingDB -> Training: Return list of trainings
Training -> Trainee: Display signed up trainings

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Trainee interaction**: The diagram starts with the trainee requesting to log in to the platform.
2. **Authentication Service**: This component handles the authentication part, ensuring the user is who they claim to be. It interacts with the User Database to validate the trainee's credentials.
3. **User Database**: Stores and manages user data, including login credentials and user profiles. It responds to the Authentication Service with a confirmation if the trainee's credentials match.
4. **Successful Authentication**: Once the trainee is authenticated successfully, the diagram moves forward to fetching the trainings the trainee has signed up for.
5. **Training Service**: This part of the system handles requests related to training sessions, including fetching a specific user's registered trainings. It interacts with the Training Database to retrieve this information.
6. **Training Database**: Contains detailed information about all the training sessions, including which users have signed up for which sessions. It sends the relevant data back to the Training Service, which then forwards it to the trainee.

This sequence ensures the trainee can successfully view the list of training sessions they've signed up for, enabling better scheduling and planning for their event experience. The diagram focuses on the login process and the retrieval of the trainee's registered training sessions, highlighting the flow of interactions in the system for this specific use case.

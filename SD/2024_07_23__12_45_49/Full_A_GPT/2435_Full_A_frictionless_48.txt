Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interaction between a developer, an online data validation service, and a data repository in a series of sequential steps. Below is a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this interaction. This example assumes the use of a generic online data validation service connected to a developer's data repository.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant "Data Repository"
participant "Online Validation Service" as OVS

Developer -> "Data Repository" : Push data update
activate "Data Repository"

"Data Repository" -> OVS : Notify of data update
activate OVS

OVS -> "Data Repository" : Retrieve updated data
activate "Data Repository"
deactivate "Data Repository"

OVS -> OVS : Validate data
OVS -> "Data Repository" : Send validation results
deactivate OVS

"Data Repository" -> Developer : Display validation results
deactivate "Data Repository"
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the flow starts when the developer pushes an update to the data repository. The data repository, upon receiving the update, notifies the online validation service (OVS) about this change. The OVS then retrieves the updated data from the repository for validation. After validating the data, the OVS sends the validation results back to the data repository, which in turn displays or forwards these results to the developer.

This PlantUML code demonstrates a basic interaction pattern for the proposed user story, focusing on the data validation process. The actual implementation might require more steps or interactions, depending on the specifics of the data repository, the online validation service capabilities, and the requirements for data validation feedback to the developer.

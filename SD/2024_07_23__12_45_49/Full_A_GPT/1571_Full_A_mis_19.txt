Creating a detailed UML sequence diagram for the specified user story involves depicting the flow between different system components as they interact to fulfill the requirement of making item metadata discoverable while the item is itself under embargo. Given the technical specificity and the context required to accurately represent this process, I'll outline a basic PlantUML sequence diagram that corresponds to the user story. 

This diagram will include actors and components like the Collection Curator, the EDRMS system (including its Embargo Management module and Search module), and potentially an external system or user trying to access metadata. Please note that in a real-world scenario, additional details and components could be involved based on system architecture and design specifics which aren't detailed in the project description. 

**PlantUML Code:**

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Curator as "Collection Curator"
participant "EDRMS System" as EDRMS
database "Repository" as Repo
participant "Embargo Management" as Embargo
participant "Search Module" as Search

Curator -> EDRMS : Requests to set embargo on an item
EDRMS -> Repo : Verifies item exists
EDRMS -> Embargo : Sets embargo on the item
Embargo -> Repo : Updates item status to "Under Embargo"
EDRMS --> Curator : Confirms embargo set

activate Embargo
Curator -> EDRMS : Requests to make metadata discoverable
EDRMS -> Embargo : Verifies item is under embargo
Embargo -> Search : Updates to allow metadata visibility
deactivate Embargo

Search -> Repo : Ensures metadata is indexed & Searchable
EDRMS --> Curator : Confirms metadata is discoverable while item is embargoed

actor User as "External User/System"
User -> Search : Searches for item
Search -> Repo : Retrieves item metadata
alt item under embargo
    Search -> User : Returns item metadata without access to the item
else item not under embargo
    Search -> User : Returns item metadata and access
end

**Explanation of the Diagram Steps:**

1. *Set Embargo:* The Collection Curator requests the EDRMS system to set an embargo on an specific item. The system verifies the item exists within the repository and then sets the embargo, confirming this action back to the curator.

2. *Make Metadata Discoverable:* Subsequently, the Curator requests to make the item's metadata discoverable even while it remains under embargo. The system checks the embargo status and updates the system to allow for the metadata's visibility, confirming this to the curator once done.

3. *External Access:* An external user or system searches for the item. The Search module of the EDRMS checks the repository, and if the item is still under embargo, it returns only the metadata to the external requestor, not the item itself.

This sequence diagram outlines a simplified interaction flow based on the provided user story and project description. Depending on project specifics, additional steps or components (like authentication and authorization checks, detailed interaction with external systems for indexing metadata, or logging actions for auditing) might be necessitated.

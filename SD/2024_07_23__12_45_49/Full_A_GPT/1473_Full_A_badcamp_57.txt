To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an administrator, I want to bulk approve sessions as accepted, so that I can save time," using PlantUML syntax, follow the structure outlined below. This diagram outlines the interactions between the Administrator, the Web Application interface, and the Database for the bulk approval process of sessions.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Administrator as admin
participant "Web Application\nInterface" as webApp
database "Platform Database" as db

== Bulk Approval of Sessions ==

admin -> webApp : Selects sessions for bulk approval
activate webApp

webApp -> db : Fetch selected session details
activate db
db --> webApp : Returns session details
deactivate db

webApp -> webApp : Validate session selection\nand admin privileges
webApp -> db : Update session status to 'Accepted'
activate db
db --> webApp : Confirmation of update
deactivate db

webApp --> admin : Display success message\n(Sessions approved)
deactivate webApp

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the administrator selecting the sessions they wish to bulk approve. The web application then communicates with the database to fetch the details of these sessions and validates both the selection and the administrator's privileges to perform this action. Upon validation, the status of the selected sessions is updated to 'Accepted' in the database. Finally, a success message is displayed to the administrator, indicating that the sessions have been approved.

This diagram can be further customized based on more specific requirements or additional steps in the process, such as sending notifications to session submitters or logging the bulk approval action for auditing purposes.

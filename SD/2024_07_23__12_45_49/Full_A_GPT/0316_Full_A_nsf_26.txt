To visualize the described user story in the context of the project—focusing on a CMS Subject Matter Expert (SME) who wants to see the webmaster workflow report to understand potential impacts on current direction—a detailed sequence diagram is outlined below. This sequence captures interactions from the CMS SME's request through to the generation and review of the webmaster workflow report within the environment of the NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative.

This PlantUML sequence diagram captures the key steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CMS_SME as "CMS SME"
participant CMS as "Content Management System"
participant DB as "Database"
participant Server as "Web Server"
participant ReportGen as "Report Generator"
participant Webmaster as "Webmaster"

CMS_SME -> CMS: Request webmaster workflow report
CMS -> DB: Query webmaster workflow data
DB -> CMS: Return workflow data
CMS -> Server: Process request for report
Server -> ReportGen: Generate report with workflow data
ReportGen -> Server: Report generated
Server -> Webmaster: Send report for review
Webmaster -> CMS_SME: Present workflow report
CMS_SME -> CMS_SME: Assess impact on current direction

This sequence diagram outlines the key interactions starting from the CMS SME requesting the webmaster workflow report, continuing with querying and receiving workflow data from the database, generating the report, and concluding with the CMS SME assessing the potential impact based on the presented report.

### Key Points in the Sequence:

1. **Request for Report**: The CMS SME initiates the process by requesting access to the webmaster workflow report from the CMS.
   
2. **Data Query and Collection**: The CMS communicates with the project's database to query necessary workflow data associated with the webmaster's activities.
   
3. **Report Generation**: This data is then processed, and a report is generated through the server's interaction with a report generator tool, specifically designed to collate and present workflow data.
   
4. **Review and Presentation**: Upon generation, the report is sent to the Webmaster (or another designated personnel) for a preliminary review. Following this, it is presented to the CMS SME.
   
5. **Assessment of Impact**: The CMS SME closely reviews the provided report to understand the webmaster's workflow and assess any potential impacts on the current direction of CMS strategy or implementation.

Please note, specific implementations, tool selections (e.g., the CMS or report generation software), and the flow of interactions can vary based on project details not specified in the description.

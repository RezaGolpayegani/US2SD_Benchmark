Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story involves illustrating how different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) interact when a librarian wants to reserve shelves for incoming books. Let's break down the process into steps and represent it in PlantUML format.

1. **Librarian initiates the process**: The librarian starts the procedure by accessing the book management feature within the CLMS.
2. **Book management system receives request**: The system checks the incoming book details.
3. **Inventory updates**: The Inventory Management component is queried to find available shelf space.
4. **Shelf selection**: The system suggests available shelves based on the size and category of the incoming books.
5. **Reservation confirmation**: The librarian selects the appropriate shelf, and the reservation is confirmed.
6. **Update shelf status**: The Shelf Management component updates the status of the shelf to reserved.
7. **Notification sent**: A confirmation is sent to the librarian, and possibly notifications to other relevant staff about the reservation for preparation and book placement upon arrival.

Here is how you could represent this sequence in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
entity "Book Management System" as BookSystem
entity "Inventory Management" as Inventory
entity "Shelf Management" as Shelf

Librarian -> BookSystem : Initiate Reserve Shelf for Incoming Books
BookSystem -> Inventory : Check Available Shelf Space
Inventory -> Shelf : Query Available Shelves for Book Size and Category
Shelf --> BookSystem : Suggest Available Shelves
BookSystem -> Librarian : Display Available Shelves
Librarian -> BookSystem : Select Shelf for Reservation
BookSystem -> Shelf : Reserve Shelf
Shelf -> BookSystem : Update Shelf Status to Reserved
BookSystem -> Librarian : Confirm Shelf Reservation

This script utilizes PlantUML to visualize the sequence of interactions for reserving shelves for incoming books by a librarian within the library management system. It highlights the simplicity and efficiency of task execution facilitated by the system, providing a clear and manageable overview of the operational flow.

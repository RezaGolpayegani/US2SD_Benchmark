Given the complexity and richness of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) and focusing on the specific user story where a librarian wants to keep track of member subscription information, below is a sequence diagram outlined using PlantUML syntax. This diagram maps out the interactions between different entities in the system to fulfill this task.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as lib
participant "Subscription Management\nInterface" as smi
participant "Database" as db

== Update Subscription Information ==

lib -> smi: Access Subscription Management
alt Subscription Details Found
    smi -> db: Query Member Subscription
    db -> smi: Return Subscription Details
    smi -> lib: Show Subscription Details
    
    lib -> smi: Request Update Subscription
    smi -> db: Update Subscription Details
    db -> smi: Confirmation Update
    smi -> lib: Show Update Confirmation
else No Subscription Details
    smi -> db: Query Member Subscription
    db -> smi: Error: No Details Found
    smi -> lib: Show No Subscription Message
end

== Subscription Renewal Process ==

lib -> smi: Access Subscription Management
smi -> db: Check Subscription Status
db -> smi: Subscription Status Returned

alt Subscription Active
    smi -> lib: Show Active Status
    lib -> smi: Request Renewal (if needed)
    smi -> db: Process Renewal Request
    db -> smi: Renewal Confirmation
    smi -> lib: Show Renewal Success
else Subscription Expired
    smi -> lib: Show Expired Status
    lib -> lib: Inform Member About Renewal
    lib -> smi: Process Renewal
    smi -> db: Update Subscription Status
    db -> smi: Confirmation Status Updated
    smi -> lib: Show Update Confirmation
end

### Explanation:

- **Librarian (Actor):** Initiates the process by trying to access or update the subscription information of a library member.
- **Subscription Management Interface:** This is where the librarian interacts with the system to manage subscription data. It represents both the front-end interface and the backend logic handling these requests.
- **Database:** The backend storage that holds all member subscription information, including status (active, expired), renewal dates, and subscription types.

### Steps Illustrated:

1. **Accessing Subscription Management:** The librarian accesses the subscription management section to either view or update a member's subscription.
2. **Query for Subscription Details:** The subscription management system queries the database for the member's subscription details.
   - If details are found, they are displayed to the librarian.
   - If no details are found, an error message is shown.
3. **Updating Subscription Information:** If the subscription details need to be updated (e.g., renewing a subscription, changing a subscription type), the librarian makes the request through the subscription management interface.
   - The request to update the database is processed, and confirmation of the update is shown.
4. **Subscription Renewal Process:** Similarly, for renewal, the system checks the current subscription status.
   - If the subscription is active, its details are shown. Optionally, if a renewal is requested ahead of time, the process to renew is initiated.
   - If the subscription is expired, the librarian is informed (and presumably communicates this to the member), following which the renewal process can be initiated upon member's confirmation.

This sequence diagram is a simplified overview focusing on the particular user story; the actual implementation might involve more detailed checks, error handling, and additional steps based on the system's requirements and design specifics.

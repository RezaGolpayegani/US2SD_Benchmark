Creating a sequence diagram for the specific user story, "As a repository manager, I want to view available versions of an object and restore a version from the staff interface," involves visualizing the interactions between the user and the system components within the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS).

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Repository Manager" as Manager
participant "Staff Interface" as Interface
participant "Version Control" as VersionControl
database "EDRMS Database" as Database

Manager -> Interface : Request object versions
Interface -> VersionControl : Retrieve versions list
VersionControl -> Database : Query available versions
Database --> VersionControl : Return versions data
VersionControl --> Interface : Show versions to manager
Interface --> Manager : Display versions

Manager -> Interface : Select version to restore
Interface -> VersionControl : Initiate version restore
VersionControl -> Database : Restore selected version
Database --> VersionControl : Confirm restoration
VersionControl --> Interface : Notify restoration success
Interface --> Manager : Display success message

In this sequence diagram:

1. **The Repository Manager** initiates the process by requesting to view the available versions of an object through the **Staff Interface**.
2. The **Staff Interface** then communicates with the **Version Control** system to retrieve a list of available versions for the requested object.
3. **Version Control** queries the **EDRMS Database** to get the data on available versions.
4. The **Database** returns the version information back to the **Version Control** system.
5. **Version Control** sends this information back to the **Staff Interface**, which then displays the versions to the **Repository Manager**.
6. The **Repository Manager** selects a version of the object to restore and communicates this choice through the **Staff Interface**.
7. The **Staff Interface** sends a request to **Version Control** to restore the selected version.
8. **Version Control** executes the restoration command on the **EDRMS Database**.
9. Once the restoration is confirmed by the **Database**, a success message is routed back through **Version Control** and the **Staff Interface** to the **Repository Manager**.

This sequence diagram assumes a simplified interaction flow and may need adjustments to fit the specific implementation details and technologies used in the EDRMS project.

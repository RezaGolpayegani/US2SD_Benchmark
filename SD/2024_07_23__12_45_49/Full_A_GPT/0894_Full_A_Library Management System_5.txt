To address the specific user story of allowing a customer to identify which book has been read the most in a given month within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), we need a sequence diagram detailing the process from the perspective of the system component interactions. We'll assume that the system keeps track of book borrowing and returns, and employs a method to tally readings per book over time. Hereâ€™s how the process might be outlined in a PlantUML sequence diagram format:

```plaintext
@startuml
actor Customer

participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Recommendation System" as RecSys
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> Web: Request most read book this month
Web -> RecSys: Fetch data on most read book
RecSys -> DB: Query book borrowings & returns this month
DB --> RecSys: List of books with borrowing counts
RecSys -> RecSys: Calculate most read book
RecSys --> Web: Return most read book details
Web --> Customer: Display most read book information

@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the Customer making a request through the web interface. The web interface, in turn, communicates with the Recommendation System to fetch data concerning the most read book of the month. The Recommendation System queries the database to obtain book borrowing and returning data for the current month. The database returns a list of books and their respective borrowing counts to the Recommendation System, which calculates the most read book based on this data. Finally, the details of the most read book are passed back up the chain to the Customer through the Web Interface.

Note that this diagram simplifies complex interactions and omits potential error handling and security checks for brevity. Depending on system design requirements, additional steps like authentication and authorization checks before allowing access to the data might be necessary and can be incorporated into an extended version of this sequence diagram.

Given your requirements for a sequence diagram detailing the process a moderator goes through to select an estimation strategy (modified Fibonacci sequence or powers of 2) in the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT), below is a PlantUML sequence diagram representation. This assumes the presence of a web interface for the moderator and backend services to handle the logic and data storage:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Moderator as mod
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Estimation Game Service" as gameService
participant "Database" as db

mod -> web: Accesses AEPT
activate mod
activate web

web -> gameService: Request existing game settings
activate gameEnterprise
gameService -> db: Query game settings
activate db

db --> gameService: Return game settings
deactivate db
gameService --> web: Show game settings with estimation options
deactivate gameEnterprise

web --> mod: Display estimation options\n(modified Fibonacci or powers of 2)
deactivate web
mod -> web: Selects estimation strategy
activate web

web -> gameService: Update game with selected strategy
activate gameEnterprise
gameService -> db: Save selected strategy
activate db

db --> gameService: Confirm strategy update
deactivate db
gameService --> web: Update confirmation
deactivate gameEnterprise
web --> mod: Display confirmation message
deactivate web

deactivate mod
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the moderator accessing the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool via its web interface. The web interface requests the current game's settings from the Estimation Game Service, which then retrieves any existing settings from the database. Once the current settings are returned and displayed, the moderator is able to select their preferred estimation strategy (modified Fibonacci sequence or powers of 2) through the web interface. The web interface then sends this update to the Estimation Game Service, which saves the selected strategy to the database. The database confirms the update, and the Estimation Game Service sends this confirmation back to the web interface, which finally informs the moderator of the updateâ€™s success.

Remember, the actual implementation details could vary based on the specific architectures, libraries, and frameworks you decide to use. This diagram assumes a straightforward, ideal interaction without considering possible errors or alternative paths for brevity and clarity.

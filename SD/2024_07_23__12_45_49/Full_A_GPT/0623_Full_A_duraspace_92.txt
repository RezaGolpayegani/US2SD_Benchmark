Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between the DAMS (Digital Asset Management System) manager, DIMS (DAMS Integration and Management System), and possibly other system components involved in managing and notifying about policy expiration on an object or its components. Below is the PlantUML code that outlines the process from the perspective of a DAMS manager wanting to know the expiration date of a library policy applied to an object or its component.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DAMSManager as "DAMS Manager"
participant DIMS as "DIMS System"
database PolicyDB as "Policy Database"
participant NotificationService as "Notification Service"

== Check Policy Expiration for an Object or Component ==

DAMSManager -> DIMS : Request policy details for object/component
activate DIMS

DIMS -> PolicyDB : Query policy expiration for given object/component
activate PolicyDB

PolicyDB --> DIMS : Return policy details
deactivate PolicyDB

DIMS -> NotificationService: Determine if near expiration
activate NotificationService

NotificationService --> DIMS : Expiration status and details
deactivate NotificationService

DIMS --> DAMSManager : Provide expiration details
deactivate DIMS

== End ==

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

- **DAMS Manager:** Initiates the request to know the policy expiration details for a specific object or component.
- **DIMS System:** Acts as the intermediary, processing requests from the DAMS manager. It fetches the policy details from the "Policy Database" and checks the expiration status through the "Notification Service."
- **Policy Database:** Stores details of policies applied to objects or components, including their expiration dates.
- **Notification Service:** A system component that determines if a policy is nearing expiration based on the current date and the policy's expiration date. It can also handle sending out notifications if set up for that purpose.

This sequence diagram simplifies the interaction and omits some potential additional steps for clarity, such as authentication processes and error handling mechanisms. Depending on the actual implementation specifics of DIMS and its components, there might be more or fewer steps involved.

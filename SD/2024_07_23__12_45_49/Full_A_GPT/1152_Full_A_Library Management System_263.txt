Given the scope of your project description, a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to look up books by subject category" can be illustrated in PlantUML format as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Library Database" as Database
participant "Results Processor" as Processor

Member -> Search : Enter subject category
activate Search
Search -> Database : Query books by category
activate Database
Database -> Processor : Return query results
deactivate Database
Processor -> Search : Process & Sort results
deactivate Processor
Search -> Member : Display book results
deactivate Search
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The **Member** initiates the action by entering a subject category into the **Search Interface**. This reflects a web form or search box within the Comprehensive Library Management System where users can input their search criteria.

2. The **Search Interface** constructs a query based on the input subject category and forwards this query to the **Library Database**. The interface acts as the middleman between the user and the database, encapsulating the complexity of database querying.

3. The **Library Database** receives the query, executes it by searching within its records for books that match the specified subject category, and gathers the results. The database's role is crucial as it holds all the information about books, including categories.

4. The **Library Database** then sends the list of books found (query results) back to the **Results Processor**. This component is responsible for taking raw query results and processing them â€“ potentially sorting, filtering further, or enriching the data for presentation.

5. The **Results Processor** processes the data as needed and sends the formatted results back to the **Search Interface**. This step ensures that the results are user-friendly and relevant to the member's search.

6. Finally, the **Search Interface** displays the results to the **Member**. This could be in the form of a list or grid, with options to view more details about each book.

This sequence diagram depicts a straightforward process for a member to look up books by subject category within the Comprehensive Library Management System, focusing on the interaction between the user interface, database, and intermediate processing.

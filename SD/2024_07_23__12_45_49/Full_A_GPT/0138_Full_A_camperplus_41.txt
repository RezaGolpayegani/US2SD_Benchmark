To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a parent, I want to be able to message my child's counselor so that I can voice my concerns or check on my child's progress" using PlantUML, we need to outline the interaction process. This includes the steps the parent goes through, from logging in to the Camp Management & Communication Platform, finding the counselor's contact, sending a message, and receiving a confirmation of the message being sent.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Parent as p
participant "Parent Portal" as pp
participant "Database" as db
participant "Counselor Profile" as cp
participant "Messaging System" as ms
participant Counselor as c

p -> pp : Login to Platform
pp -> db : Retrieve Parent Profile
db -> pp : Display Parent Dashboard
p -> pp : Select Message Counselor Option
pp -> db : Retrieve Counselor List
db -> pp : Display Counselors
p -> pp : Select Counselor
pp -> cp : View Counselor Profile
p -> ms : Compose Message
ms -> db : Log Message
db -> ms : Confirm Message Saved
ms -> cp : Notify Counselor of New Message
cp -> c : Counselor Receives Notification
ms -> p : Display Confirmation to Parent

```

Explanation of the Sequence:

1. **Parent (Actor)**: The user who initiates the process by logging into the platform.
2. **Parent Portal (Participant)**: The interface through which the parent interacts, including logging in, selecting messaging options, and viewing counselor profiles.
3. **Database (Participant)**: Stores and manages all data, including parent profiles, counselor lists, and messages.
4. **Counselor Profile (Participant)**: The section where information related to the counselor is displayed to the parent.
5. **Messaging System (Participant)**: The system that facilitates the sending, storing, and receiving of messages between parents and counselors.
6. **Counselor (Actor)**: The recipient of the message sent by the parent, who is also notified of new messages.

Steps in the Process:

- The parent logs into the Parent Portal where their profile is retrieved from the Database.
- The Parent Portal displays the parent dashboard.
- The parent selects the option to message a counselor, leading to the retrieval and display of a list of counselors.
- The parent selects a counselor, views their profile, and then proceeds to compose a message in the Messaging System.
- The Messaging System logs the message in the Database and confirms the message is saved.
- The Messaging System notifies the Counselor of the new message.
- The Counselor receives a notification, and the Messaging System displays a confirmation to the parent that the message has been sent.

This sequence diagram outlines the high-level process flow and interactions involved in allowing a parent to message their child's counselor through the Camp Management & Communication Platform.

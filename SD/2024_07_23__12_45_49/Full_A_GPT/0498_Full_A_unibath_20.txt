Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a depositor, I want to manage and share “live” research data, so that the whole project workflow is linked together" involves visualizing the interaction between various system components and the depositor. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format which outlines this interaction considering the key features and objectives mentioned in the project description.

The scenario depicted involves a depositor managing and sharing live research data through the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, including depositing data, setting embargoes, and sharing data with collaborators.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Depositor
participant WebClient as "Web Client"
participant WebInterface as "Web Interface"
participant DataManager as "Data Manager"
participant ArchiveSystem as "Archive System"
participant VRE as "Virtual Research Environment"
participant ExternalSystems as "External Systems\n(Pure/Opus)"
participant DOIService as "DOI Service"
participant MetadataService as "Metadata Service"
participant AccessControl as "Access Control"
participant CollaborationTools as "Collaboration Tools"

Depositor -> WebClient : Access platform
WebClient -> WebInterface : Request data management page
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> DataManager : Verify depositor access
activate DataManager
DataManager -> AccessControl : Check access rights
activate AccessControl
AccessControl --> DataManager : Access Granted
deactivate AccessControl
DataManager --> WebInterface : Access confirmed

WebInterface --> WebClient : Display data management options
deactivate WebInterface

WebClient -> WebInterface : Upload "live" data
activate WebInterface

WebInterface -> DataManager : Initiate data upload
DataManager -> ArchiveSystem : Deposit data
activate ArchiveSystem
ArchiveSystem -> VRE : Link data to project
activate VRE
VRE --> ArchiveSystem : Data linked
deactivate VRE

ArchiveSystem -> DOIService : Request DOI
activate DOIService
DOIService --> ArchiveSystem : DOI minted
deactivate DOIService

ArchiveSystem -> MetadataService : Generate metadata
activate MetadataService
MetadataService --> ArchiveSystem : Metadata attached
deactivate MetadataService

ArchiveSystem -> ExternalSystems : Sync with University systems
activate ExternalSystems
ExternalSystems --> ArchiveSystem : Data synced
deactivate ExternalSystems

ArchiveSystem --> DataManager : Data deposit successful
DataManager -> AccessControl : Set embargoes and permissions
AccessControl --> DataManager : Embargoes and permissions set

DataManager -> CollaborationTools : Share data with collaborators
activate CollaborationTools
CollaborationTools --> DataManager : Data shared
deactivate CollaborationTools

DataManager --> WebInterface : Confirm "live" data shared
WebInterface --> WebClient : Display confirmation message
deactivate WebInterface

This diagram illustrates a sequence where:
- The depositor accesses the platform and requests to manage their data.
- The web client communicates with the platform's web interface, which in turn verifies the depositor's access through the Data Manager.
- The Data Manager, upon confirming access rights, allows the depositor to upload "live" research data.
- The data is deposited in the archive system, linked to the project in the Virtual Research Environment, and synced with external University systems like Pure and Opus.
- A DOI is minted for the data, and metadata is generated for enhanced discoverability.
- Access controls, such as embargoes and collaborator permissions, are set.
- Finally, the data is shared with collaborators through integration with collaboration tools, and the depositor is notified of the successful management and sharing of their "live" research data.

This sequence diagram is a conceptual representation and might be adjusted or extended based on the specific technical and functional requirements during the actual implementation phase of the platform.

Below is a detailed PlantUML code snippet for a sequence diagram that represents the described user story process. This diagram captures the sequence of interactions between the platform administrator, the OpenSpending platform, and the Viewer when translating the data types hierarchies in embed mode.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as Admin
participant "OpenSpending Platform" as Platform
participant "Viewer (Embed Mode)" as Viewer

Admin -> Platform: Log in
activate Platform
Platform --> Admin: Authentication Success

Admin -> Platform: Navigate to Viewer Settings in Embed Mode
activate Viewer
Platform --> Admin: Load Viewer Settings

Admin -> Viewer: Select "Translate Data Types"
Viewer -> Viewer: Display Translation Options

Admin -> Viewer: Choose Target Language
Viewer -> Viewer: Apply Language Selection
Viewer --> Admin: Display Translated Data Types

Admin -> Viewer: Confirm Translations
Viewer -> Platform: Save Translation Settings
Platform --> Admin: Confirm Translation Success

deactivate Platform
deactivate Viewer

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram follows the interactions starting from the platform administrator logging into the OpenSpending platform, navigating to the viewer settings while in embed mode, selecting to translate the data types, choosing the target language, applying the language selection, saving the settings, and receiving confirmation of the successful translation.

Remember, this is a simplified version focusing on the main steps involved in the user story from the OpenSpending Enhancement Project. Depending on the platform's existing architecture and the specific implementation details, there might be additional steps or systems involved (like a localization management system or direct integrations with automatic translation services).

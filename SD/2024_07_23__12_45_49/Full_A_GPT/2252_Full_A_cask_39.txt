Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this specific user story involves outlining the flow of actions from the initiation of a custom administrative operation like "compaction" or "rebalance" by a dataset developer to the completion of that operation within the advanced dataset management and version control system. Here's how you can represent this in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DatasetDeveloper as developer
participant "Dataset Management \nSystem" as DMS
participant "Dataset Type Interface" as DTI
participant "Specific Dataset \nImplementation" as SDI
database DataSetDB as DB

== Custom Administrative Operation Execution ==

developer -> DMS : Request Custom Operation (Compaction/Rebalance)
activate DMS

DMS -> DTI : Determine Operation Support
activate DTI

DTI -> SDI : Invoke Custom Operation
activate SDI

SDI -> SDI : Validate Operation
SDI -> DB : Execute Operation on Dataset
activate DB

DB --> SDI : Operation Success/Failure
deactivate DB

SDI --> DTI : Return Status
deactivate SDI

DTI --> DMS : Confirm Execution & Status
deactivate DTI

DMS --> developer : Operation Completion Notification
deactivate DMS

This PlantUML sequence diagram script visually breaks down the sequence of interactions involved in a dataset developer initiating a custom administrative operation like "compaction" or "rebalance" on a dataset. 

- **DatasetDeveloper** is the actor initiating the request.
- **Dataset Management System (DMS)** receives the request and handles the main coordination.
- **Dataset Type Interface (DTI)** represents the generalized interface for dataset operations, determining if the requested operation is supported.
- **Specific Dataset Implementation (SDI)** is a particular implementation of a dataset that includes specific administrative operations.
- **DataSetDB** symbolizes the database where the datasets are stored, and where the operation has its direct effect.

This diagram illustrates a direct, linear process flow illustrating command initiation, operation validation and execution, and feedback provision to the dataset developer upon completion or failure of the requested operation. Each participant (actor and systems) plays a crucial role in ensuring that the administrative tasks are accurately and efficiently performed on the dataset.

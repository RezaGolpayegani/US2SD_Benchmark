To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story, we'll outline the interaction between different components involved in the process where an app developer attempts to redeploy an application, and the redeployment process checks for dataset reconfigurability before proceeding. If any of the datasets cannot be reconfigured, the redeployment fails.

Please note that this sequence diagram assumes a generic platform where these interactions occur and simplifies some interactions for clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant AppDeveloper as developer
participant DeploymentService as deployment
participant DatasetManagement as datasetMgmt
participant AppConfigService as appConfig
participant DatasetService as dataset

developer -> deployment: initiateRedeployment(appID)
deployment -> appConfig: checkDeploymentConfig(appID)
activate appConfig
appConfig --> deployment: configOK
deactivate appConfig
deployment -> datasetMgmt: listDatasets(appID)
activate datasetMgmt
datasetMgmt --> deployment: datasetIDs[]
deactivate datasetMgmt

loop for each datasetID in datasetIDs
    deployment -> dataset: checkReconfigurability(datasetID)
    activate dataset
    alt if dataset is reconfigurable
        dataset --> deployment: reconfigurable
        deactivate dataset
    else dataset not reconfigurable
        dataset --> deployment: error
        deactivate dataset
        deployment -> developer: redeploymentFailed(datasetID)
        deactivate deployment
        return
    end
end

deployment -> deployment: redeployApplication(appID)
deployment -> developer: redeploymentSuccess()
deactivate deployment

This diagram illustrates the following interactions for the user story:

1. **App Developer Initiates Redeployment**: The app developer initiates the redeployment of an application by sending a request to the Deployment Service.
2. **Check Deployment Configuration**: The Deployment Service checks the application's deployment configuration with the AppConfigService.
3. **List Associated Datasets**: If the configuration is OK, the Deployment Service then asks the Dataset Management service to list all datasets associated with the application.
4. **Check Dataset Reconfigurability**: For each dataset associated with the application, the Deployment Service checks if the dataset can be reconfigured (showing an interaction with a generic Dataset Service).
   - If all datasets are reconfigurable, the process continues.
   - If any dataset cannot be reconfigured, the Deployment Service informs the app developer that the redeployment failed due to dataset reconfiguration issues and stops the redeployment process.
5. **Redeploy Application**: If all checks pass, the Deployment Service proceeds with the application redeployment.
6. **Inform App Developer**: Finally, the Deployment Service informs the app developer that the redeployment has been successful.

This sequence diagram is based on the user story and the functionality described in the project description. It visualizes the interactions required to ensure application redeployment fails if any of its datasets cannot be reconfigured, highlighting the check for dataset reconfigurability as a crucial step in the process.

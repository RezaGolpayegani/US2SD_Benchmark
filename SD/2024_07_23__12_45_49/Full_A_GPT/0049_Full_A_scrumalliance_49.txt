To create a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story using PlantUML, we'll outline the sequence of interactions between the recruiter (user), the web interface of the Scrum Alliance Community Platform, and the backend systems involved in extending a job advertisement for an additional 30 days. This will cover the process from the recruiter logging in, finding their ad, and updating the posting's duration.

Here's how the PlantUML code could look:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Recruiter
participant "Web Interface" as Web
database "Job Listings Database" as DB

== Extend Job Ad Duration ==
Recruiter -> Web : Access Site & Login
Web -> DB : Validate Recruiter Credentials
DB -> Web : Credentials Validated

Web -> Web : Show Dashboard
Recruiter -> Web : Navigate to My Job Ads
Web -> DB : Retrieve Recruiter's Job Ads
DB -> Web : Job Ads List

Recruiter -> Web : Select Ad to Extend
Web -> Web : Display Ad Details
Recruiter -> Web : Click Extend Ad for 30 Days
Web -> DB : Update Ad Expiry Date +30 Days
DB -> Web : Confirmation of Extension

Web -> Recruiter : Show Confirmation Message

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Recruiter Accesses Site & Logs In:** The recruiter accesses the platform and logs in. The web interface then validates the recruiterâ€™s credentials against the Job Listings Database.
2. **Navigate to My Job Ads:** Once logged in, the recruiter navigates to their dashboard and selects "My Job Ads" to view a list of their ads.
3. **Select Ad to Extend:** The recruiter picks the job advertisement they wish to extend.
4. **Extend Ad Duration:** A detailed view of the selected ad is shown, and the recruiter can choose to extend the ad for another 30 days by clicking the appropriate option.
5. **Update in Database:** The web interface sends a request to the database to update the expiry date of the ad by an additional 30 days.
6. **Confirmation:** Once the database updates the ad's expiry date, a confirmation message is displayed to the recruiter through the web interface.

This sequence diagram is focused on the specific interactions required to extend the duration of a job ad. It simplifies the recruitment ad management feature into a series of steps for clarity and understanding.

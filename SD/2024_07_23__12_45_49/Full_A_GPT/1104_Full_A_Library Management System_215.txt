Creating a sequence diagram for a complex system in text format can be quite extensive, but I'll provide a simplified version focusing on the specific user story: "As a manager, I want to see all interactions." Assuming this refers to interactions within the system, such as generating reports on book borrowing, the popularity of books, and so forth, here's a basic PlantUML code to visualize these interactions. Note that this example is highly simplified and focuses on the request flow from a system manager to generate a report on library interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager

participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Web : Request interactions report
Web -> Backend : Get report data (interactions)
Backend -> DB : Query interaction records
DB -> Backend : Return records
Backend -> Web : Process & compile report
Web -> Manager : Display interactions report

@enduml
```

Explanation of Steps:

1. **Manager** initiates the process by requesting a report of all interactions from the Web Interface.
2. The **Web Interface** forwards this request to the **Backend System** to obtain the necessary data for the report.
3. The **Backend System** queries the **Database** for interaction records, which might include information on book borrowings, reservations, book recommendations, and other user actions within the library system.
4. The **Database** returns the requested records back to the Backend System.
5. The **Backend System** then processes and compiles these records into a comprehensive report format, which might involve aggregating data, performing some analytics, or formatting the data for presentation.
6. Finally, the **Web Interface** presents this compiled report back to the **Manager**, allowing them to view all interactions within the library system as requested.

This sequence diagram is kept broad on purpose to accommodate various interpretations of "seeing all interactions." Depending on the specific requirements and technical architecture of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the details and components involved could vary considerably.

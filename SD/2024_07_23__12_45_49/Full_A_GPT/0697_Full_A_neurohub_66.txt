Given the scope of your request, I'll outline a basic sequence diagram for the user story: *"As a user, I want to sync events created in Neurohub with a web-based Calendar such as Google Calendar."* Note that this assumes there's a process in place within Neurohub to create events and an API or service that facilitates the synchronization with external calendars like Google Calendar. 

Please, see the following PlantUML code snippet which you can refine based on the specific technologies or protocols you are using (OAuth for authentication, specific APIs for the calendar services, etc.).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Neurohub Interface" as Neurohub
participant "API Gateway" as API
participant "Google Calendar API" as GoogleAPI
participant "Google Calendar" as GoogleCal

User -> Neurohub : Create/Update Event
Neurohub -> API : Request sync with Google Calendar
API -> GoogleAPI : Authenticate as User
alt Authentication Success
    GoogleAPI -> API : Auth token
    API -> GoogleAPI : Send Event Details\n(Auth Token)
    GoogleAPI -> GoogleCal : Create/Update Event
    GoogleCal -> GoogleAPI : Confirmation
    GoogleAPI -> API : Sync Confirmation
    API -> Neurohub : Confirmation Message
    Neurohub -> User : Display Sync Success
else Authentication Failure
    GoogleAPI -> API : Auth Error
    API -> Neurohub : Display Auth Error
    Neurohub -> User : Display Sync Failure/Retry Option
end

This sequence diagram begins with the user interacting with Neurohub's interface to create or update an event. Then, Neurohub communicates with an API gateway, abstracting the direct interaction with Google's Calendar API. This gateway takes care of authenticating against the Google Calendar API, which, if successful, results in an authentication token that's used for subsequent operations.

If the authentication is successful, the event details are sent to Google's API for the actual calendar entry creation or update. Once the operation is confirmed by Google Calendar, the confirmation is propagated back to the user through Neurobus's interface.

In the case of authentication failure, an error path is shown where the error message travels back to the user, offering a chance to retry the operation, perhaps with renewed authentication.

This outline provides a foundational view of the interactions involved in syncing events from Neurohub to a Google Calendar. Depending on your requirements and existing infrastructure, additional details like error handling, concurrent event syncing, and specific API rate limits might need to be considered and incorporated into the design.

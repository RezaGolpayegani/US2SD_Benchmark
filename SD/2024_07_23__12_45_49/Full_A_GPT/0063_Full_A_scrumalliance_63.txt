Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you provided involves illustrating the interactions between the site visitor, the community platform (including its various components), and the RSS feed system. Below is an example of how this could be represented in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram assumes that the community platform has a front-end interface that communicates with a back-end system capable of handling RSS feed subscriptions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Visitor as "Site Visitor"
participant "Front-end Interface" as Frontend
participant "Subscription Service" as Subscription
participant "RSS Feed Generator" as RSSGen
participant "Database" as DB

Visitor -> Frontend : Request RSS Feed Subscription page
Frontend -> Visitor : Display RSS Feed Subscription options

Visitor -> Frontend : Submit RSS Subscription request
Frontend -> Subscription : Validate request
alt Valid Request
    Subscription -> DB : Check if email exists
    alt Email not Registered
        DB -> Subscription : Email not found
        Subscription -> RSSGen : Generate new RSS subscription
        RSSGen -> DB : Store new RSS subscription details
        DB -> RSSGen : Confirmation of subscription details storage
        RSSGen -> Subscription : RSS Subscription link generated
        Subscription -> Frontend : RSS Subscription link
        Frontend -> Visitor : Display RSS Subscription successful + Link
    else Email Registered
        DB -> Subscription : Email found
        Subscription -> Frontend : Error - Email already subscribed
        Frontend -> Visitor : Display Error message
    end
else Invalid Request
    Subscription -> Frontend : Error - Invalid subscription request
    Frontend -> Visitor : Display Error message
end

This sequence diagram walks through the process:

1. The site visitor requests the RSS Feed Subscription page through the front-end interface.
2. The front-end interface presents the subscription options to the visitor.
3. The visitor submits their subscription request.
4. The subscription request is validated by the Subscription Service.
   - If the request is valid, the service checks with the database to see if the email is already registered for an RSS subscription.
     - If the email is not found in the database (meaning it's a new subscription), the RSS Feed Generator generates a new subscription, and the details are stored in the database. The visitor is then given a confirmation that their subscription was successful, along with the RSS subscription link.
     - If the email is found (meaning it's already subscribed), an error message is displayed to the visitor indicating that the email is already subscribed.
   - If the request is invalid, an error message is displayed to the visitor.

Keep in mind, this representation is relatively abstract. The actual implementation details might require adjustments based on the specific technologies used for the community platform, the database schema, and the business rules for handling RSS subscriptions.

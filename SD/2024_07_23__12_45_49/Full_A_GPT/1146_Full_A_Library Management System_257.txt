To create a Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to know shelf numbers of the books so that I can find them easily," we need to model the interactions among the system components like the User Interface (UI), Backend Server, and Database. This will help illustrate the process from the moment a library member searches for a book until the system displays the requested shelf information.

Below is a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format, demonstrating the steps involved in this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "UI: Library Web App" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Member -> UI : Enter search query\n(Title, Author, or Category)
activate UI
UI -> Backend : Request book information\nincluding shelf number
activate Backend
Backend -> DB : Query book details by search parameters
activate DB
DB -> Backend : Return book details\n(including shelf number)
deactivate DB
Backend -> UI : Display book details\nincluding shelf location
deactivate Backend
UI -> Member : Show search results with\nshelf numbers
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Member Interaction:** The diagram starts with the library member (or user) entering a search query through the library's web application UI. This query could be based on the book's title, author, or category.

2. **UI to Backend Communication:** The UI captures this query and forwards it to the Backend Server, requesting detailed information for the books that match the search criteria, including their shelf numbers.

3. **Backend to Database Query:** The Backend Server processes this request and makes a query to the Database to retrieve the book details based on the provided search parameters.

4. **Database Response:** The Database executes the query and returns the requested book details (including shelf numbers) to the Backend Server.

5. **Displaying Results:** The Backend Server sends this information back to the UI, where it's formatted and displayed to the member. The displayed results include the shelf numbers to help the member locate the books easily in the library.

6. **Member Receives Information:** Finally, the library member views the search results on the UI with the books' locations, completing the process.

This sequence diagram outlines the typical flow of actions triggered by a library member's request to find the shelf numbers of books, depicting how various system components interact to fulfill this request within the Comprehensive Library Management Just ask  if you need further explanations or additional diagrams!

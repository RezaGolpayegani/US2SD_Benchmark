Below is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML format focusing on the user story: "As a customer, I want to make a book recommendation." This sequence diagram assumes the process involves a customer logging into the CLMS, searching for a book, and then submitting a recommendation for that book. Note that actual implementations can vary based on specific requirements and system designs.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Login Page" as LoginPage
participant "Search Page" as SearchPage
participant "Book Details Page" as BookDetails
participant "Recommendation System" as RecSystem
database "CLMS Database" as Database

Customer -> LoginPage : Enter credentials
LoginPage -> Database : Validate user
Database -> LoginPage : Authentication result
LoginPage --> Customer : Authentication success

Customer -> SearchPage : Search for book
SearchPage -> Database : Query book details
Database -> SearchPage : Return book result
SearchPage --> Customer : Display search result

Customer -> BookDetails : Select book
BookDetails -> Database : Fetch book details
Database -> BookDetails : Display selected book info
BookDetails --> Customer : Show book details

Customer -> RecSystem : Access recommendation form
RecSystem --> Customer: Display recommendation form

Customer -> RecSystem : Submit book recommendation
RecSystem -> Database : Save recommendation
Database -> RecSystem : Confirmation
RecSystem --> Customer : Show submission success

This diagram outlines the basic steps a customer would take to make a book recommendation through the CLMS:

1. **Login**: The customer first logs in to the system. The authentication process is handled by the login page interacting with the system database.
2. **Search for Book**: The customer uses the search functionality to find a book they want to recommend. The search query is processed, with results fetched from the database.
3. **Select Book**: Upon selecting a book from the search results, the book's details are presented to the customer.
4. **Access Recommendation Form**: The customer accesses the form to submit a recommendation for the book.
5. **Submit Recommendation**: The customer submits their recommendation. This action is processed by the recommendation system, which then saves the recommendation to the database and confirms the action to the customer.

This diagram is kept reasonably high-level and focuses on the interactions related to making a book recommendation. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to detail each component's internal processes or include additional elements such as error handling procedures, database schema details, or more precise interactions between system components.

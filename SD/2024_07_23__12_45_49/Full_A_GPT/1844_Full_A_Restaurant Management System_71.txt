Creating detailed sequence diagrams for specific user stories can provide a clear understanding of the interactions between system components and users. For the user story "As a customer, I want to see available foods and drinks through a screen so that I can select the ones that I prefer," the sequence diagram in PlantUML format might look something like the following. This representation will cover the steps from when the customer initiates a request to view the menu until the items are displayed to them.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Customer Views Available Foods and Drinks

actor Customer
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> UI : Selects 'View Menu'
UI -> Server : Request to fetch menu items
Server -> DB : Query available items
DB --> Server : Return list of items
Server --> UI : Display available items
UI --> Customer : Show foods & drinks menu
@enduml
```

### Explanation of Steps:
1. **Customer Selects 'View Menu':** The interaction begins with the customer selecting the option to view the menu on the user interface (UI), e.g., tapping on a menu icon in a mobile app or web page.

2. **Request to Fetch Menu Items:** The UI sends a request to the backend server to retrieve the list of available menu items. This includes foods, drinks, and possibly other categories based on availability and restaurant offerings.

3. **Query Available Items:** The backend server processes this request and queries the database to obtain the list of currently available menu items. This step involves checking for which items are available for order at the time of the request.

4. **Return List of Items:** The database returns the requested information back to the server. This data includes details such as item names, descriptions, prices, and potentially images.

5. **Display Available Items:** The server then processes this data and sends it back to the UI, which formats and displays the available menu items to the customer.

6. **Show Foods & Drinks Menu:** Finally, the customer is presented with the foods and drinks menu on their screen, enabling them to browse through the options and make their selections based on preferences.

This sequence diagram outlines the basic processes involved in fetching and displaying a list of available menu items to a customer in a restaurant management and operations system. The actual implementation can include additional complexities, such as handling dietary restrictions and preferences, offering customization options, and integrating real-time updates from the kitchen about item availability.

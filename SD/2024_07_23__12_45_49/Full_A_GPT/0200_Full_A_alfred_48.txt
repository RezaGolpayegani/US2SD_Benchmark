To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story where an Older Person wants to use ALFRED to hear about the news, we will outline the interaction between the user, ALFRED, and the components involved in fetching and delivering the news. This interaction assumes that ALFRED has a module or capability to integrate with news services (whether it be an API-driven service or another mechanism to fetch news content).

Please note that for simplicity, this diagram focuses on the core interactions and might abstract some complex system and network interactions involved in such a system.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED Device" as alfred
participant "Speech Recognition" as speech
database "News Service" as news
participant "Text-to-Speech\nEngine" as tts

user -> alfred : "I want to hear today's news"
alfred -> speech : interpretVoiceCommand()
speech -> alfred : commandRecognized("hear news")

alt command is "hear news"
    alfred -> news : fetchNews()
    news --> alfred : returnNewsContent("news data")
    alfred -> tts : convertTextToSpeech("news data")
    tts --> alfred : audioStream("news audio")
    alfred -> user : playAudio("news audio")
else unrecognized command
    alfred -> tts : convertTextToSpeech("Sorry, I didn't catch that.")
    tts --> alfred : audioStream("error message audio")
    alfred -> user : playAudio("error message audio")
end

This sequence diagram starts with the Older Person (user) initiating a request to hear about today's news via a voice command to the ALFRED device. ALFRED interprets this voice command through its Speech Recognition component, understanding that the user wants to hear the news. Assuming the command is recognized correctly as "hear news", ALFRED then fetches the news content through a News Service â€“ which could represent an API call to a third-party news provider.

Once the news content is returned to ALFRED, it is sent to a Text-to-Speech Engine to be converted into an audio stream. Finally, this audio is played back to the user. If the command isn't recognized correctly, the diagram shows an alternative flow where an error message is converted to speech and played back to the user.

This diagram outlines a simple interaction flow that adheres to the user story requirements while showcasing the potential of ALFRED's underlying technology stack.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a corporate sponsor, I want to make my logo randomly appear on the home page, so that others see the company's support of Scrum." entails illustrating the interactions between the actors (such as the corporate sponsor and the system or platform administrator) and the system itself. Here is how you could represent this in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Corporate Sponsor" as sponsor
participant "Sponsorship Management System" as system
participant "Database" as db
participant "Home Page" as home

sponsor -> system : Submit logo and sponsorship details
activate system

system -> db : Validate sponsorship status
activate db
db --> system : Status: Valid
deactivate db

system -> db : Save logo details
activate db
db --> system : Confirmation: Logo Saved
deactivate db

system --> sponsor : Confirmation: Logo submission successful
deactivate system

... time passes ...

home -> system : Request random logos for display
activate system

system -> db : Retrieve random logos
activate db
db --> system : Return selected logos
deactivate db

system --> home : Display selected logos
deactivate system

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the process from the perspective of a corporate sponsor submitting their company's logo to be displayed randomly on the home page, highlighting the interactions with the Sponsorship Management System, database operations for validating sponsor status and saving logo details, and the eventual display of logos on the home page. 

Keep in mind, sequence diagrams can be tailored with more or fewer details based on the requirements of your project documentation, and different scenarios may require adjustments to the sequence illustrated above.

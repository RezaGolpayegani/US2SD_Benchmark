Generating a detailed PlantUML code for a Sequence Diagram that illustrates the process of tracking employee data to determine earnings based on working hours involves various components of the system interacting with each other. The following PlantUML code represents this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Employee Management System" as EMS
participant Database as DB

M -> EMS : Request employee work data
activate EMS
EMS -> DB : Query employee hours
activate DB
DB --> EMS : Return hours data
deactivate DB
EMS -> EMS : Calculate earnings based on hours
EMS --> M : Display earnings information
deactivate EMS

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the process:

1. The **Manager** initiates a request to the **Employee Management System** (EMS) to retrieve data on employee working hours.
2. The EMS then queries the **Database** for the specified employee's work hours.
3. Upon receiving the data from the Database, the EMS calculates the earnings for each employee based on their logged working hours.
4. Finally, the EMS presents the earnings information back to the Manager.

Please note that the earnings calculation logic is simplified here. In reality, this step might involve more complex logic, including hourly rates, overtime, bonuses, etc., which can be incorporated depending on the system's requirements.

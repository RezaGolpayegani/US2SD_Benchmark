Given your requirement, the following is a basic example of a PlantUML sequence diagram that represents the user story of a librarian wanting to store member information in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Librarian
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Librarian -> UI: Access member registration form
UI -> Backend: Request member registration page
Backend -> UI: Return member registration page
UI -> Librarian: Display member registration form

Librarian -> UI: Submit member information
UI -> Backend: Validate and process member information
activate Backend
Backend -> DB: Store member information
activate DB
DB --> Backend: Confirm member stored
deactivate DB
Backend -> UI: Confirm member registration
deactivate Backend
UI -> Librarian: Display confirmation message

@enduml
```

To run this, you would need a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor. This diagram simplifies the process into key interactions:

1. **Librarian accesses the member registration form**: This initiates the process where the librarian interacts with the UI to access the system's member registration functionality.

2. **UI requests and displays form**: The UI Interface requests the member registration page from the Backend System, which then returns the relevant page for display to the Librarian.

3. **Librarian submits member information**: After filling out the form with the new member's information, the librarian submits this data through the UI Interface.

4. **Backend validates and processes information**: The submitted information is validated and processed by the Backend System. This step might include checks for existing member information to avoid duplicates and validation of data formats.

5. **Database storage**: The Backend System sends the member information to be stored in the Database. Upon successful storage, the Database confirms back to the Backend System.

6. **Confirmation displayed to librarian**: Finally, the Backend System sends a success message to the UI Interface, which then displays a confirmation message to the librarian indicating that the member has been successfully registered.

This sequence diagram assumes a simplified view of the process that could be part of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), focusing on the involvement of the librarian, UI Interface, Backend System, and Database in storing new member information.

To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see all the reserved books" in PlantUML format, you would need to establish the interactions between the librarian, the library management system interface, and the database. Here is a simplified version of how these interactions might be laid out in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Library\nManagement\nSystem" as system
database "Database" as database

librarian -> system : Request to view all reserved books
activate system

system -> database : Query for all reserved books
activate database

database --> system : Return list of reserved books
deactivate database

system --> librarian : Display all reserved books
deactivate system

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Librarian initiating a request to view all reserved books through the Library Management System. The system then queries the Database for all reserved books. Once the Database returns the list of reserved books, the system displays this information back to the librarian.

This is a basic flow and does not include potential error handling or additional steps such as authentication or accessing specific details of a reservation. Depending on the complexity and requirements of the CLMS, additional steps and participants (like a security system for authentication) might be necessary to fully capture all interactions for this user story.

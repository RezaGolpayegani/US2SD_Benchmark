Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a user story where an employee wants to log their work times involves depicting the interaction between the user (employee), the front-end interface of your Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), and the back-end server handling data transactions to the database. Since the original project description doesn’t specify a feature directly related to time tracking for employees, this addition implies an enhancement to cater to internal library management functionalities. 

Given this scenario, we’ll assume the existence of an “Employee Work Log” module within the CLMS that supports time entry, editing, and review. The sequence diagram in Plant UML format below illustrates the series of interactions for an employee logging their work times:

```plaintext
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant "CLMS Frontend" as CF
participant "Authentication Server" as AS
participant "Work Log Server" as WLS
participant Database as DB

E -> CF : Clicks on "Log Work Time"
CF -> AS : Validates Employee session
AS --> CF : Session Valid
CF -> E : Displays Work Log Form

E -> CF : Submits Work Time Entry
note right of E: Work Time Details: \n- Date \n- Start Time \n- End Time

CF -> WLS : Request to Log Work Time
activate WPA

alt Work Time Validations Pass
    WLS -> DB : Save Work Time Entry
    DB --> WLS : Acknowledge Save
    WLS --> CF : Work Time Logged Successfully
    CF -> E : Display Success Message
else Validation Fails
    WLS --> CF : Error Message (Validation Failed)
    CF -> E : Display Error Message
end

alt Edit Work Time
    E -> CF : Requests to Edit Work Time
    CF -> WLS : Request to Retrieve Work Time Data
    WLS -> DB : Fetch Work Time Entry
    DB --> WLS : Work Time Data
    WLS --> CF : Display Work Time Data
    CF -> E : Shows Editable Form with Data
    E -> CF : Submits Updated Work Time
    CF -> WLS : Update Work Time Entry in DB
    DB --> WLS : Acknowledge Update
    WLS --> CF : Work Time Updated Successfully
    CF -> E : Display Success Message for Update
end

### Explanation:
- **Employee (E)**: Initiates interactions by trying to log or edit work times.
- **CLMS Frontend (CF)**: Serves as the interface where the employee interacts. It captures work time entries and commands initiated by the employee and communicates with the backend servers.
- **Authentication Server (AS)**: Handles user session validation to ensure that the user attempting to log or edit work time is authenticated, ensuring security.
- **Work Log Server (WLS)**: Acts as a middleman between the frontend and the database, managing business logic, validations, and data transactions related to work time logging.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores and retrieves work time entries and related data.

This diagram lays out a foundational approach to integrating a work time logging feature into a library management system, illustrating how various system components might interact to support it.

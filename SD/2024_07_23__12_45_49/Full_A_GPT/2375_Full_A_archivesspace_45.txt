Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the development of a custom importer by a developer within the context of the Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement project can illustrate the step-by-step interactions between the developer, the system, and other components. However, keep in  mind that the following PlantUML code is a simplified representation and real-world scenarios might require addressing additional complexity.

Below is the PlantUML code necessary to create a sequence diagram for the developer's user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Custom Importer API" as ImporterAPI
participant "Authentication Module" as Auth
participant "Data Import Module" as DataImport
participant "Database" as DB

Developer -> ImporterAPI: Request development documentation
ImporterAPI -> Developer: Provide documentation

Developer -> ImporterAPI: Initialize custom importer development
activate ImporterAPI

ImporterAPI -> Auth: Request API access
activate Auth
Auth --> ImporterAPI: Validate and provide access
deactivate Auth

Developer -> ImporterAPI: Develop custom import logic
ImporterAPI -> DataImport: Integrate import logic
activate DataImport

DataImport -> DB: Create import schema
activate DB
DB --> DataImport: Confirm schema creation
deactivate DB

DataImport -> Auth: Request user data access permission
Auth --> DataImport: Grant permission

DataImport -> DB: Execute data import
DB --> DataImport: Confirm import success
deactivate DataImport

ImporterAPI -> Developer: Notify development success
deactivate ImporterAPI

Developer -> ImporterAPI: Deploy custom importer
ImporterAPI -> DataImport: Request deployment
DataImport -> DB: Update system with new importer
DB --> DataImport: Confirm update
DataImport -> Developer: Deployment successful

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the developer requesting development documentation from the Custom Importer API. After receiving the documentation, the developer initiates the custom importer development and requests API access through the Authentication Module. Upon getting access, the developer develops the custom import logic and integrates it with the Data Import Module. The Data Import Module, in turn, handles the creation of an import schema in the database, requests user data access permission, and executes the data import process after obtaining permission.

After successfully developing the custom importer, the developer notifies the Custom Importer API about the success, and proceeds to deploy the custom importer. The deployment process includes the Data Import Module updating the system with the new importer and confirming update success to the developer.

This diagram is an abstraction and the actual sequence might involve more steps or interactions, depending on specific project requirements and the system architecture.

To create a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a library member, I want to display my previous checkouts so that I can keep track of the books that I borrowed", we'll outline the steps taken by the library system from when a user requests to view their previous book checkouts until the system displays those checkouts. This involves interactions between the user (library member), the library's frontend interface, the controller handling the request, the service layer processing the logic, and the database where checkout data is stored.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Controller" as Controller
participant "Checkout Service" as Service
database "Library Database" as Database

Member -> Frontend : Request to view previous checkouts
Frontend -> Controller : GET /member/checkouts
Controller -> Service : fetchMemberCheckouts(memberId)
Service -> Database : Query previous checkouts
Database --> Service : Return checkout data
Service --> Controller : Checkout data
Controller --> Frontend : Display checkouts
Frontend --> Member : Show previous checkouts

### Explanation of Each Step in the Diagram:

1. **Member Requests to View Previous Checkouts**: The library member initiates the process by requesting to see their previous book checkouts through the library's user interface (UI), typically by clicking on a section or link designed for this purpose.

2. **Frontend Interface to Controller**: The frontend interface sends this request to the backend, calling the appropriate API endpoint (e.g., `GET /member/checkouts`) to retrieve the user's previous checkout history.

3. **Controller Fetches Data**: The controller, acting as the intermediary between the request from the frontend and the service layer, calls the checkout service, passing along the necessary identifier for the member (e.g., `memberId`) to fetch the required data.

4. **Checkout Service Queries Database**: The checkout service processes the logic for the request. It constructs and executes a query against the library database to retrieve the previous checkout records associated with the specified member ID.

5. **Database Returns Checkout Data**: The library database, which stores all the data related to book checkouts, returns the list of previous checkouts for the member to the checkout service.

6. **Checkout Data Processed and Returned**: The checkout service receives the checkout data and may perform any necessary logic (e.g., formatting the data) before sending it back to the controller.

7. **Controller to Frontend Interface**: The controller, now with the processed data, sends it back to the frontend interface with the details of the member's previous checkouts.

8. **Display Previous Checkouts to Member**: Finally, the frontend interface displays the list of previous checkouts to the member, allowing them to review their borrowing history.

This diagram outlines a typical flow but can be extended or modified based on additional requirements or implementation details, such as error handling, member authentication, and more nuanced frontend behavior.

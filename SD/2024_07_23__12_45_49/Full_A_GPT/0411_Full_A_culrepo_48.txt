To design a sequence diagram for the user story provided, considering the complexities and features listed in the Comprehensive Digital Repository System project for Cornell University, I'll outline a simplified PlantUML code sequence. This will illustrate the process an external user might follow to find and access research and educational materials related to a particular topic.

Please note, the sequence diagram will focus on the interactions between the system components such as the user interface, search system, access control, and data storage. Given the project description's emphasis on user-friendliness and comprehensive access, the diagram will reflect an intuitive and secure process for accessing materials.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor ExternalUser as User
participant "Search Interface" as Search
participant "Authentication System\n(Shibboleth)" as Auth
participant "Content Management\nSystem" as Content
participant "Data Storage" as Storage

User -> Search : Enter search query\nfor specific topic
Search -> Content : Request relevant\nmaterials
Content -> Storage : Fetch metadata\nof materials
Storage --> Content : Metadata of\nrelated materials
Content --> Search : Display search\nresults with metadata
User -> Search : Select desired material
Search -> Auth : Request access\nfor external user
Auth --> User : Prompt login/create account
User -> Auth : Login/Signup
Auth --> User : Authentication successful
User -> Search : Request selected material
Search -> Content : Check access permissions
Content -> Storage : Fetch full material
Storage --> Content : Return requested material
Content --> Search : Deliver material to user
Search --> User : Display/download\nmaterial

This diagram represents a sequence where an external user searches for academic resources on a particular topic, undergoes an authentication process (assuming the system requires this for external users, which might depend on the material's access rights), and subsequently accesses the desired materials.

**Key Points:**
- **Search Interface:** Represents the system's user interface where the external user inputs their query.
- **Authentication System (Shibboleth):** This tool is used for managing secure remote access, highlighting the integration with Shibboleth for authentication.
- **Content Management System & Data Storage:** These components work together to manage and retrieve the academic materials requested, handling metadata and actual content delivery.

This diagram simplifies complex backend processes such as metadata handling, access rights management, and the actual content delivery into more manageable interactions. Depending on the project's phase and detail level required, further breaking down components or adding additional steps (like error handling or feedback loops) might be necessary for a full implementation plan.

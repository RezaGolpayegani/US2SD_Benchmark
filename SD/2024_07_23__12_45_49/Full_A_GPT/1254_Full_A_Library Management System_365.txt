Given the user story's requirements, I'll illustrate how to create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that depicts the process of a student viewing page information for specific books in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Remember, sequence diagrams help in visualizing how different system parts (objects, actors, components) interact over time for a given scenario.

### User Story:
As a student, I want to be able to see page information of books.

### PlantUML Sequence Diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Student as student
participant "Search Interface" as searchInterface
participant "System API" as systemAPI
participant "Database" as database
participant "Book Information" as bookInfo

student -> searchInterface : search(query)
searchInterface -> systemAPI : requestBookSearch(query)
systemAPI -> database : fetchBookData(query)
database --> systemAPI : bookDataResults
systemAPI -> bookInfo : extractPageInfo(bookDataResults)
bookInfo --> student : displayPageInfo

@enduml
```

### Components Explanation:

- **Student:** This is the actor who initiates the process, in this scenario, by searching for a book to view its page information.

- **Search Interface:** This represents the user interface that the student interacts with to input their search query (e.g., title, author).

- **System API:** This component acts as a middleman that processes the search request from the interface, queries the database, and then handles the response.

- **Database:** This is where all book data is stored. It receives a query from the System API, retrieves the corresponding book data, and sends it back.

- **Book Information:** Once the System API retrieves the book data, this component is responsible for extracting specifically the page information of the book(s) from the query results and preparing it for display.

- **displayPageInfo:** This is the final step where the page information of the books fetched from the database is presented to the student.

The sequence diagram clearly outlines the interactions and flow from the student's initial action to the display of the book page information. This visual representation can be adjusted or expanded to incorporate additional functionalities or details pertinent to the Comprehensive Library Management System.

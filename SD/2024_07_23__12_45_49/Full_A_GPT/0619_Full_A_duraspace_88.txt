Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interaction between different system components and actors within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS) to achieve the objective of notifying a DAMS manager about the expiration of a statute's pertinence to an object or component. Below is a representation of how these interactions could be modeled using PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant DAMSManager as manager
participant "DIMS System" as DIMS
database "Copyright Database" as DB
participant "Notification Service" as Notify
participant "Calendar/Scheduler" as Scheduler

== Check Statute Expiration for Object/Component ==

manager -> DIMS : Check statute expiration
DIMS -> DB : Retrieve statute details\n(for object/component)
DB --> DIMS : Statute details and expiration date
DIMS -> Scheduler : Schedule expiration check
Scheduler --> DIMS : Expiration date confirmed

== On Expiration Date ==
Scheduler -> DIMS : Notify of statute expiration
DIMS -> Notify : Trigger notification
Notify -> manager : Send statute expiration alert

```

### Breakdown of the Sequence Diagram Elements:

1. **DAMSManager (manager):** The DAMS manager initiates the process by requesting to check when the pertinence of a statute to an object or component is due to expire.

2. **DIMS System (DIMS):** Acts as the central system that manages requests, performs operations related to digital asset management, and interfaces with the copyright database and other subsystems.

3. **Copyright Database (DB):** Contains details about copyrights, statutes, licenses, policies, and their applicable terms, including expiration dates related to objects or components.

4. **Notification Service (Notify):** A subsystem responsible for sending out notifications to users, such as the DAMS manager, to alert them about various events, including statute expirations.

5. **Calendar/Scheduler (Scheduler):** Manages scheduling and timing events, such as reminding the system or a user when a specific statute's pertinence to an object or component is about to expire.

The sequence starts with the DAMS manager requesting information on statute expiration. The DIMS system retrieves this information from the copyright database, schedules a check for the statute's expiration date, and upon the date's arrival, triggers a notification to be sent to the DAMS manager.

This diagram is a high-level representation. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the DIMS, additional details and steps may be necessary.

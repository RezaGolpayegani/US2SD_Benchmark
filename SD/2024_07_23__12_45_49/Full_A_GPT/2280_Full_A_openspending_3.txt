Creating a sequence diagram for the specified user story involves detailing the step-by-step process a Data Publishing User will go through to delete a published dataset on the OpenSpending platform. Below is a sequence diagram written in PlantUML format to depict this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Publishing User" as User
participant "OpenSpending Platform Interface" as Interface
participant "Dataset Management Service" as ManagementService
participant "Database" as DB

User -> Interface : Select "My Published Datasets"
Interface -> ManagementService : Request user's published datasets
ManagementService -> DB : Query published datasets by user
DB -> ManagementService : Return list of datasets
ManagementService -> Interface : Display datasets to user
User -> Interface : Choose dataset to delete
Interface -> ManagementService : Request dataset deletion (dataset ID)
alt If dataset can be deleted
    ManagementService -> DB : Delete dataset record (dataset ID)
    DB -> ManagementService : Confirm deletion
    ManagementService -> Interface : Display success message
    Interface -> User : Show dataset successfully deleted
else If dataset cannot be deleted
    ManagementService -> Interface : Display error message (reason)
    Interface -> User : Show failure to delete dataset
end

This diagram starts with the user selecting "My Published Datasets" from the OpenSpending platform interface. The platform then requests the list of published datasets from the Dataset Management Service, which queries the database for datasets published by the user. Once the datasets are returned, the user selects one for deletion. The request for deletion is then sent to the management service, which attempts to delete the record from the database. If successful, a confirmation message is displayed; if not, an error message is shown explaining why the deletion could not be processed.

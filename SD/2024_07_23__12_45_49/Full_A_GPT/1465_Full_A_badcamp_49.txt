To illustrate how an authenticated user can utilize a WYSIWYG editor for updating long-form content without having to know HTML, we'll create a sequence diagram in PlantUML format. The sequence diagram will describe interactions between the user, the platform's frontend interface, the backend server, and potentially a content management system (CMS) that's part of the infrastructure to process and store the updated content.

Please note, the specific implementation details can vary based on the technology stack used for developing the BADCamp Experience and Administration Enhancement Platform. Here, we'll keep the process relatively generic to be adaptable for most web development environments.

```
@startuml
title User updates content using WYSIWYG editor

actor AuthenticatedUser as User
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Content Management System" as CMS

User -> Frontend : Navigate to content update page
activate Frontend
Frontend -> User : Display content in WYSIWYG editor
deactivate Frontend
User -> Frontend : Edit content using editor
activate Frontend
Frontend -> User : Show preview of updated content
User -> Frontend : Submit updated content
Frontend -> Backend : Send updated content with user session info
activate Backend
note right of Backend: Validate user session\nand permissions
Backend -> CMS : Update content in database
activate CMS
CMS -> Backend : Confirm content update
deactivate CMS
Backend -> Frontend : Response with update success
deactivate Backend
Frontend -> User : Display success message
deactivate Frontent

```

This sequence diagram begins with the user navigating to the content update page on the platform's frontend interface. The frontend then displays the content that needs to be edited in a WYSIWYG editor, allowing the user to make changes without requiring knowledge of HTML. After editing, the user can preview the updated content within the same interface and submit it once satisfied.

Upon submission, the frontend sends the updated content along with the user's session information to the backend server. The backend server validates the user's session and permissions before proceeding to update the content in the database through interactions with the Content Management System (CMS). Upon successful update, the CMS confirms back to the backend server, which in turn sends a success response to the frontend. Finally, the frontend displays a success message to the user, confirming that the content has been updated.

Adjustments may be necessary based on specific technologies or additional security measures implemented in the project.

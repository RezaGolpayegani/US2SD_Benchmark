Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've given requires capturing interactions among several system components - specifically focusing on tracking downloads by a user from a digital archive management system. Here's a PlantUML code snippet that outlines a possible sequence of interactions for this scenario.

Please note, in reality, the implementation details can vary based on the specific technologies and architectural decisions made during the development of the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "User Management" as UserMan
participant "Download Tracking" as Track
participant "Database" as DB

Archivist -> UI: Select View User Downloads
UI -> Auth: Validate Archivist Credentials
Auth --> UI: Credentials Valid
UI -> UserMan: Request User List
UserMan -> DB: Fetch Users
DB --> UserMan: User List
UserMan --> UI: Display Users
UI --> Archivist: Select User
Archivist -> UI: Request Downloads for Selected User
UI -> Track: Fetch Downloads by User ID
Track -> DB: Query Downloads
DB --> Track: User Download Data
Track --> UI: Display Download Data
UI --> Archivist: Show Downloaded Items

This diagram illustrates the following steps:

1. **Validation**: The archivist selects the option to view user downloads and validates their credentials through the web interface.
2. **User List Display**: The system fetches and displays a list of users, powered by communication between the User Management service and the database.
3. **Selection**: The archivist selects a user from the list to check their download activities.
4. **Fetch and Display Downloads**: The system queries and retrieves download data for the selected user, showcasing the specific items downloaded.

Remember, this is a simplified interpretation aimed to fit the context provided by your user story. Depending on the project's complexities, other components like Analytics Services, Notification Services for alerting, or even more intricate details in interaction between components might be necessary.

To illustrate updating the book list in the Comprehensive Library Management's System (CLMS) as described in your project, here's a detailed sequence diagram described in PlantUML syntax. This sequence encompasses various components like the Librarian Interface, Library Management System (Backend), and Database that interact to facilitate the updating of a book list by a librarian. 

```
@startuml
participant Librarian as librarian
participant "Librarian Interface" as webUI
participant "Library Management System\n(Backend)" as backend
participant Database as db

librarian -> webUI : Select "Update Book List"
webUI -> backend : Request Update Form
activate backend
backend -> db : Validate librarian session
activate db
db --> backend : Session Valid
deactivate db
backend --> webUI : Provide Update Form
deactivate backend
webUI --> librarian : Display Update Form
librarian -> webUI : Submit updated book details\n(ID, Title, Author, etc.)
webUI -> backend : Process updated book details
activate backend
backend -> db : Update Book Record
activate db
db --> backend : Confirm Update Success
deactivate db
backend --> webUI : Update Confirmation
deactivate backend
webUI --> librarian : Display Update Success Message
@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Librarian Interaction**: The sequence begins with the librarian choosing to update a book list through the Librarian Interface.
2. **Request Update Form**: The Librarian Interface then requests an update form from the backend system.
3. **Session Validation**: The backend system checks with the Database to ensure the session is valid (i.e., the librarian is authenticated to make changes).
4. **Display Update Form**: Upon validating the session, the backend sends the update form back to the Librarian Interface, which then displays it to the librarian.
5. **Submits Updated Book Details**: The librarian fills out the form with updated book details and submits it through the web interface.
6. **Process Book Update**: The backend receives the updated details and processes them by updating the book record in the Database.
7. **Update Confirmation**: Once the Database confirms the update success, the backend system sends a confirmation message to the Librarian Interface.
8. **Success Message**: Finally, the Librarian Interface displays an update success message to the librarian.

This sequence diagram accounts for the basic flow involved in updating a book's details by a librarian within the CLMS. Additional error handling and security checks can be added to this diagram for a more comprehensive overview.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to create a working schedule of all waiters," involves illustrating the interactions between the manager, the restaurant management and operations system, and the database where the schedule data will be stored. This scenario assumes the manager utilizes a web interface that communicates with a server-side application to manage waiter schedules.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Server Application" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> UI: Access schedule creation page
UI -> Server: Request current waiter list
Server -> DB: Query waiter data
DB -> Server: Return waiter data
Server -> UI: Show waiter list
UI -> Manager: Display waiter list

Manager -> UI: Input new schedule details
UI -> Server: Submit new schedule data
Server -> DB: Save schedule information
DB -> Server: Confirm save operation
Server -> UI: Show save confirmation
UI -> Manager: Display confirmation message

alt Email Notification
  Server -> Server: Generate notification
  Server -> Manager: Send schedule creation confirmation email
end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in creating a working schedule for all waiters, from the manager accessing the scheduling feature to receiving a confirmation message once the schedule is successfully saved in the system. Note, the diagram includes an optional step where a confirmation email is generated and sent to the manager, acknowledging that the new schedule has been created. This reflects an additional layer of communication and confirmation, enhancing the user experience within the system.

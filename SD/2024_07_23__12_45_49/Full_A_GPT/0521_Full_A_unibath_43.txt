To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the User Story you've provided using PlantUML, follow the syntax and steps outlined below. This sequence diagram will illustrate the process of a Research Information Manager seeking to track citation counts for published datasets.

Please note, for bremsstrahlung visualization or to generate an actual diagram, you'll need to run this code in a PlantUML environment or a compatible tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant ResearchInformationManager as manager
participant WebInterface as web
participant DataManager as dataManager
participant Database as database
participant CitationTrackingSystem as citationSystem
participant ExternalCitationDB as externalDB

== Track Citation Counts for Published Datasets ==

manager -> web : Access data management platform
web -> dataManager : Request dataset list
activate dataManager

dataManager -> database : Query published datasets
activate database
database --> dataManager : Return dataset list
deactivate database

dataManager --> web : Display datasets with metadata
deactivate dataManager
web -> manager : Show datasets

manager -> web : Select dataset for citation tracking
web -> citationSystem : Request citation count
activate citationSystem

citationSystem -> externalDB : Query citations by DOI
activate externalDB
externalDB --> citationSystem : Return citation count
deactivate externalDB

citationSystem --> web : Display citation count
deactivate citationSystem
web -> manager : Show citation count for selected dataset

This sequence diagram starts with the Research Information Manager accessing the data management platform through a web interface. It then goes through querying the published datasets from the database, selecting a dataset to track, and fetching the citation count from an external citation database through the citation tracking system. Then, the citation count is displayed back to the Research Information Manager.

Key Points Covered:
- Accessing the data management platform.
- Requesting and displaying a list of published datasets.
- Selecting a dataset for tracking citations.
- Querying an external database for citation counts using dataset DOIs.
- Displaying the citation count to the Research Information Manager.

The real-world implementation might involve additional steps or details, especially concerning authentication and error handling, which are not fleshed out in this general diagram. For a more detailed representation specific to your infrastructure and processes, you might need to adapt and elaborate on this template.

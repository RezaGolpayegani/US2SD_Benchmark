Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML requires identifying the processes and interactions involved in the user story of a cook wanting to see new orders to start preparing food. In this scenario, several system components interact: the User Interface (UI) where the cook can see the orders, the Backend Server that processes order information, and the Database where orders are stored.

Given the textual nature of our interaction, below is a representation of the sequence diagram in PlantUML format. Please note, for viewing or editing this diagram, you will need access to a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "UI: Cook's Dashboard" as CookUI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

CookUI -> Backend : requestNewOrders()
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : fetchNewOrders()
activate DB
DB --> Backend : newOrdersData
deactivate DB

Backend --> CookUI : displayNewOrders(newOrdersData)
activate CookUI
CookUI -> CookUI : visualizeOrders()
deactivate CookUI

deactivate Backend
@enduml
```

This PlantUML script describes the following process:
1. The cook interacts with the UI, specifically the Cook's Dashboard part of the system, to request new orders.
2. The Cook's Dashboard sends a request to the Backend Server to fetch new orders.
3. The Backend Server, upon receiving this request, queries the Database for new orders.
4. The Database returns the data for new orders to the Backend Server.
5. The Backend Server then sends this data back to the Cook's Dashboard.
6. Finally, the Cook's Dashboard visualizes the new orders for the cook, allowing them to see and start preparing the food.

For a graphical representation and to work with this script effectively, you should use a tool or platform that supports PlantUML.

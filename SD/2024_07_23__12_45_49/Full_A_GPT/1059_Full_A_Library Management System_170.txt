To fulfill the request, I'll provide a PlantUML sequence diagram detailing the process for sending a due date notification to a library member. This sequence involves interactions between the library member (user), the library management system (CLMS), and possibly a notification service that sends out the email or SMS. 

Given the broad description of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the diagram will reflect a simplified view focusing on the key components relevant to sending a due date notification.

Please note: PlantUML syntax is straightforward, but interpreting the diagram requires basic knowledge of sequence diagrams.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryMember as member
participant "CLMS" as system
participant "Notification Service" as notifyService
participant "Database" as database

member -> system : Logs in to the Library System
activate system

system -> database : Verifies member login
activate database
database --> system : Login Success
deactivate database

system -> system : Checks if any borrowed books are due soon
activate system

system -> database : Fetch member's borrowed books with due dates
activate database
database --> system : Returns list of books and due dates
deactivate database

loop for each book with due date approaching
    system -> notifyService : Prepare due date notification
    activate notifyService
    notifyService -> system : Notification prepared
    system -> notifyService : Send due date notification to member
    notify.



    notifyService -> member : Sends due date Email/SMS
    deactivate notifyService
end

member --> system : Acknowledges notification
deactivate system

This diagram focuses on the critical steps from the member's perspective when they're set to receive a due notification for borrowed books. The sequence illustrates interactions primarily between the user, the CLMS backend system, a notification service subsystem (which could be an internal module or an integrated third-party service), and the system's database.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Member Login:** A library member logs into the CLMS, and their login is verified against the system's database.
2. **Check Due Dates:** The system checks if the member has any borrowed books with approaching due dates.
3. **Fetch Borrowed Books:** The system fetches details on the member's borrowed books and their due dates from the database.
4. **Prepare Notification:** For each book with a due date approaching, the system instructs the notification service to prepare a due date notification.
5. **Send Notification:** The notification service sends an email or SMS notification to the library member about the due date.
6. **Acknowledgment:** The member acknowledges the receipt of the notification, completing the interaction.

**Assumptions:**
- The library system automatically checks for approaching due dates at regular intervals or upon user login.

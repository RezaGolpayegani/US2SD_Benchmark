To translate the user story into a PlantUML sequence diagram format, we will map the interactions between the trainer and the system components involved in notifying and presenting the survey results about the classes.

Since the question implies a broad scenario without specific implementation details, the following representaion will capture a generic workflow for notifying a trainer about the survey results of their classes.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Trainer
participant "Notification Service" as NS
participant "Survey System" as SS
participant "Database" as DB

== Notification of Survey Results ==
Trainer -> NS : Request Notification Settings
NS -> DB : Fetch Notification Preferences
DB -> NS : Response with Preferences
note right of NS : Preferences include\nnotify on new survey results
NS --> Trainer : Notification Settings Confirmed

== New Survey Submitted ==
SS -> DB : New Survey Results Submitted
DB --> SS : Confirmation

== Check for Notification Preference ==
SS -> NS : Check if Trainer Opted for Notification
NS -> DB : Retrieve Trainer Notification Preference
DB --> NS : Notification Preference

== Notify Trainer ==
alt If Trainer opted for notification
  NS -> Trainer : Notify about New Survey Results
  Trainer -> SS : Access Survey Results
  SS -> DB : Fetch Survey Results for Trainer's Class
  DB --> SS : Survey Results Data
  SS --> Trainer : Display Survey Results
else Trainer did not opt for notifications
  NS --> [Trainer] : No Action Taken
end

### Explanation:
- **Trainer**: The user or actor who interacts with the notification service and survey system.
- **Notification Service (NS)**: The component that manages notification settings and sends notifications to trainers based on their preferences.
- **Survey System (SS)**: The system that handles surveys related to the trainer's classes and submits results.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores information like notification preferences, survey results, and other relevant data.

1. The sequence starts with the `Trainer` requesting their notification settings from the `Notification Service`.
2. The `Notification Service` fetches these preferences from the `Database`.
3. If new survey results are submitted, the `Survey System` records this in the `Database`.
4. The `Survey System` checks with the `Notification Service` if the trainer opted to receive notifications about new survey results.
5. Depending on the trainer's preferences, the `Notification Service` may notify the trainer about the new survey results.
6. The trainer can then access these results through the `Survey System`, which fetches the relevant data from the `Database`.

The sequence diagram above provides a simplified overview of the process. Depending on the project requirements, additional details and steps might be necessary.

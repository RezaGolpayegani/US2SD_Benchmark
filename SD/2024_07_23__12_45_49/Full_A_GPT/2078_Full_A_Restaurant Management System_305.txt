Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format requires breaking down the user interaction into a series of steps involving the waiter, the system's backend, and potentially the kitchen's modules (like a Chef/Cook interface). Let's outline how this process could work in a Restaurant Management and Operations System.

1. **Actor:** Waiter
2. **Goal:** To see the prepared food list so they can serve it to the customers.

Here's how the sequence diagram could be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as WInterface
participant "Backend System" as Backend
participant "Kitchen Module" as Kitchen

Waiter -> WInterface: Select "View Prepared Orders"
activate WInterface

WInterface -> Backend: Request list of prepared orders
activate Backend

Backend -> Kitchen: Fetch prepared orders
activate Kitchen

Kitchen --> Backend: Prepared orders list
deactivate Kitchen

Backend --> WInterface: Return prepared orders list
deactivate Backend

WInterface --> Waiter: Display prepared orders
deactivate WInterface

@enduml
```

Explanation of Steps:
- **Step 1:** The waiter selects the option to view prepared orders on their interface (this could be a tablet, smartphone, or computer depending on the system's setup).
- **Step 2:** The waiter's interface sends a request to the backend system to fetch the list of prepared orders.
- **Step 3:** The backend system communicates with the kitchen module, which is responsible for keeping track of order statuses.
- **Step 4:** The kitchen module sends the list of prepared orders back to the backend system. This step could involve checking a database or an in-memory list managed by the kitchen's system.
- **Step 5:** The backend system then forwards this list to the waiter's interface.
- **Step 6:** Finally, the waiter's interface displays the prepared orders, allowing the waiter to see which dishes are ready to be served to customers.

This diagram and explanation assume a basic flow where the waiter interacts with a software interface that in turn communicates with a backend system. The backend system then retrieves the necessary information from the kitchen module, which is likely part of the comprehensive Restaurant Management and Operations System described. Note that actual implementations can vary based on specific software architectures, technologies used, and additional features such as real-time updates via web sockets or other push notification mechanisms.

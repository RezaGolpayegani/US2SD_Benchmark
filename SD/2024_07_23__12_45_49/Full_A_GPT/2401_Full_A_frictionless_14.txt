Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story involves depicting the interaction between a Developer and various components of the DPIE system to accomplish the goal of getting a Data Package into Python for data analysis and visualization. Below is a simplified version that outlines this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant "DPIE Integration Module" as DIM
participant "Core Data Package API" as CDP
participant "Python Integration" as PI
database "Data Package Repository" as DPR

== Get Data Package into Python ==
Developer -> DIM : request data package for Python
DIM -> CDP : query available data packages
CDP -> DPR : fetch package details
DPR --> CDP : return package details
CDP --> DIM : package options
DIM --> Developer : display package options
Developer -> DIM : select package
DIM -> DPR : request selected Data Package
DPR --> DIM : return Data Package
DIM -> PI : integrate Data Package into Python
PI -> Developer : send confirmation & access instructions

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps in the process:

1. **Developer requests a Data Package for Python**: The Developer initiates the process by requesting a Data Package suitable for use in Python from the DPIE Integration Module.

2. **DPIE Integration Module queries available Data Packages**: The Integration Module communicates with the Core Data Package API to query available data packages.

3. **Core Data Package API fetches package details from the Repository**: The API then fetches details of available packages from the Data Package Repository.

4. **Package options displayed to Developer**: The Integration Module presents the fetched package options to the Developer for selection.

5. **Developer selects a Data Package**: The Developer selects the desired Data Package.

6. **Integration Module requests selected Data Package**: Following the selection, the DPIE Integration Module requests the specific Data Package from the Repository.

7. **Data Package returned to Integration Module**: The Repository returns the requested Data Package to the Integration Module.

8. **Integrate Data Package into Python**: The Integration Module sends the Data Package to Python Integration, which integrates it into the Python environment.

9. **Confirmation and access instructions sent to Developer**: Finally, the Developer is sent confirmation along with instructions on how to access and use the Data Package in Python for analysis and visualizations.

Remember, this is a simplified representation and might not cover all the details of the actual integration process, including error handling, authentication, and other essential interactions that might occur in a real-world scenario.

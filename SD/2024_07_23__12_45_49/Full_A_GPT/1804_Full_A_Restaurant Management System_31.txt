Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story "As a chef, I want to update the status of ordered items as 'can be served'" involves depicting the interactions between the components and actors described in the project description, specifically focusing on the Menu and Order Management aspect of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. 

Given the complexity of generating visual diagrams in a text-based format, below is a PlantUML code example that represents the intended sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Chef Interface" as Chef
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Kitchen Display System" as KDS
participant "Waiter Notification System" as WNS

Chef -> OMS : Selects order to update
OMS -> DB : Request current order status
DB -> OMS : Return current order status
OMS -> Chef : Display current order status

Chef -> OMS : Update status to 'Can be served'
OMS -> DB : Update order status in DB
DB -> OMS : Confirm status update
OMS -> KDS : Update display to 'Can be served'
OMS -> WNS : Send notification to Waiter
WNS -> OMS : Confirm notification sent

OMS -> Chef : Display update confirmation
Chef -> Chef : Confirm update visually

### Explanation:
- **Chef Interface**: This is the front-end UI through which the chef interacts with the system.
- **Order Management System (OMS)**: This backend component processes requests from the chef and communicates with other system parts.
- **Database (DB)**: Here, order statuses, among other data, are stored and retrieved.
- **Kitchen Display System (KDS)**: This system displays the current orders and their statuses for the kitchen staff.
- **Waiter Notification System (WNS)**: Notifies waiters when a dish's status is updated to 'Can be served'.

### Sequence Flow:
1. **Select and Display Order Status**: The chef selects an order to update. The OMS fetches and displays the current status from the database.
2. **Update Order Status**: The chef updates the order status to 'Can be served'. The OMS processes this change, updates the database, and confirms the update.
3. **Notify Kitchen and Waitstaff**: The KDS updates its display to reflect the new status, while the WNS sends a notification to the appropriate waiter, indicating the dish is ready to be served.
4. **Confirmation**: The chef receives a confirmation of the status update and visually verifies it.

This sequence diagram outlines the critical steps involved in updating the status of ordered items as 'can be served' from the chef's perspective, illustrating the flow and interactions with the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

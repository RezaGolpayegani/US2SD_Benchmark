To illustrate the user story "As a customer, I want to see ingredients of a dish" with a sequence diagram in PlantUML, we need to showcase the interactions between the customer, the system (front-end UI and back-end server), and the database where dish information and ingredients are stored. Below is a sequence diagram that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Front-End UI" as UI
participant "Back-End Server" as Server
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> UI : Selects dish to view details
UI -> Server : Request dish ingredients (dishID)
Server -> DB : Query dish information and ingredients (dishID)
DB --> Server : Return dish details and ingredients
Server --> UI : Display dish details and ingredients
UI --> Customer : Show dish details and ingredients list

@enduml
```

This PlantUML script demonstrates the process flow from the moment the customer selects a dish to view its details, through the system's front-end UI, making a request to the back-end server, which then queries the database for the dish's information and ingredients. The database responds with the requested data, which is passed back through the server to the UI, and finally displayed to the customer.

To run this script, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment (there are many available online or tools that can be installed locally). The script visually sequences the steps involved in fulfilling the customer's request to see the ingredients of a dish, which can help in understanding the system interactions and designing the software accordingly.

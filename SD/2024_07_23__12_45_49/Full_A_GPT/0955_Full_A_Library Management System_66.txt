Here's a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML code format for the user story mentioned. This sequence diagram illustrates how a librarian can keep track of the total numbers of borrowed books to view statistics.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Librarian as librarian
participant "LibraryManagementSystem" as system
participant "Database" as database

librarian -> system : View borrowed books statistics
activate system

system -> database : Query total borrowed books
activate database
database --> system : Return total count
deactivate database

system --> librarian : Display borrowed books statistics
deactivate system

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the interactions initiated by a librarian user who wants to view statistics about the total number of borrowed books. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Librarian to Library Management System**: The librarian initiates the action by requesting to view the statistics of borrowed books in the Library Management System (CLMS).
2. **Library Management System to Database**: The system then queries the database for the total count of borrowed books. This action represents the system's request to the database to retrieve the necessary data.
3. **Database to Library Management System**: The database processes the query and returns the total count of borrowed books to the Library Management System.
4. **Library Management System to Librarian**: Finally, the system displays the statistics of borrowed books to the librarian.

By following this sequence, the librarian can effectively keep track of and analyze the statistics related to borrowed books, aiding in better management and decision-making for the library.

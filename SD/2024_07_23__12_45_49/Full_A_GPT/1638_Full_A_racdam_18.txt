Here's a detailed example of a PlantUML sequence diagram for the described user story: "As an archivist, I want to automatically create access copies of files, so that I don't have to do this manually."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as arch
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "File Management System" as fms
participant "Storage" as storage
database "Archival Repository" as repo

arch -> web : upload file(s)
web -> fms : initiate file upload
fms -> storage : save original file(s)
storage -> fms : confirm save
fms -> fms : check file type
alt is image or text file
    fms -> fms : initiate OCR if text
    fms -> storage : save OCR text
    storage -> fms : confirm OCR save
    fms -> fms : create access copy (with watermarks if needed)
else is video or audio file
    fms -> fms : create compressed access copy
else other file types
    fms -> fms : create standard access copy
end
fms -> storage : save access copy
storage -> fms : confirm access copy save
fms -> repo : update metadata with access copy details
repo -> fms : confirm metadata update
fms -> web : show success message to archivist
web -> arch : display success and file details

This sequence diagram describes the process an archivist would go through when uploading files to a digital archive management system for the purpose of automatically creating access copies. The process includes:

1. The archivist uploads the file(s) through a web interface.
2. The web interface requests the file management system (FMS) to initiate the file upload.
3. The FMS saves the original file(s) in storage.
4. Storage confirms the save back to the FMS.
5. The FMS checks the file type to determine the appropriate process for creating an access copy.
6. Depending on the file type (image, text, video, audio, or other), different procedures are carried out:
   - For image or text files, OCR might be initiated for text files, and access copies are created with potential watermarks if needed.
   - For video or audio files, a compressed access copy is created.
   - For other file types, a standard access copy is made.
7. The access copy is saved back to storage.
8. Storage confirms the save of the access copy to the FMS.
9. The FMS updates the metadata in the archival repository with the details of the access copy.
10. The archival repository confirms the metadata update.
11. Finally, a success message and file details are displayed to the archivist through the web interface.

This diagram illustrates a high-level overview of the automation process for creating access copies of files uploaded by an archivist, aiming to minimize manual work and streamline the archival process.

The project you described involves a complex workflow with multiple phases and stakeholders. Given your requirement for a sequence diagram for a specific user story involving a mid-point check-in, I'll focus on detailing out the communication and collaboration phase as it pertains to scheduling and preparing for a mid-point check-in. 

The sequence diagram outlined below is written in PlantUML format. It represents the interactions between different roles (team members, project manager, and the scheduling system) to establish when the mid-point check-in is and what it will cover.

Please note, to render this diagram, you will need a PlantUML environment or an online tool that can interpret PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant TeamMember as TM
participant ProjectManager as PM
participant SchedulingSystem as SS
participant AgendaDoc as AD

TM -> PM : Request Mid-Point Check-In Details
activate PM
PM -> SS : Check Schedule for Mid-Point Check-In
activate SS
SS --> PM : Mid-Point Check-In Date & Time
deactivate SS
PM -> AD : Prepare Agenda for Check-In
activate AD
AD --> PM : Agenda Outline
deactivate AD
PM -> TM : Provide Mid-Point Check-In Details & Agenda
deactivate PM

note right of TM
  The Team Member now knows the date, 
  time, and coverage of the Mid-Point Check-In, 
  enabling planning and preparation.
end note

This sequence diagram starts with a team member requesting details about the mid-point check-in from the project manager. The project manager then checks the schedule for the mid-point check-in date and time using the scheduling system, prepares the agenda for the check-in, and finally communicates the details and agenda back to the requesting team member.

This overview showcases a simplified process of planning and communication for a mid-point project check-in. Actual implementations might include more roles or automated notifications, depending on project management tools in use and the team's workflow preferences.

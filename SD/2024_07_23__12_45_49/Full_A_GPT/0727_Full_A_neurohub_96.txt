Given the project description and focusing on the user story provided, below is a representation of a sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrating the scenario where a researcher wants to restrict the data they share to certain researchers or groups. This diagram includes the interactions between the user (Researcher), the system interfaces, and other components involved in the data sharing process with restriction settings.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as r
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Authentication Module" as auth
participant "Data Management" as dm
participant "Access Control" as ac
participant "Database" as db

== Restrict Data Sharing ==
r -> ui: Select file/folder to share
ui -> dm: Request file metadata
dm -> db: Retrieve metadata
db -> dm: Return metadata
dm --> ui: Display metadata and sharing options
ui -> r: Show sharing options

r -> ui: Specify restrictions (researches/groups)
ui -> ac: Process restrictions
ac -> db: Update sharing settings

== Authentication Check ==
ac -> auth: Verify researcher identities
auth -> db: Check researcher credentials
db -> auth: Confirm identities

== Apply Restrictions ==
auth -> ac: Confirmed identities
ac -> db: Apply restrictions to data
db -> ac: Restrictions applied
ac --> ui: Confirmation message
ui -> r: Display confirmation

This sequence diagram starts with the Researcher selecting the file or folder they wish to share through the User Interface (UI Interface). The Data Management component then retrieves and returns the metadata for the selected item to be shared, with the UI displaying the relevant sharing options to the Researcher. The Researcher specifies the restrictions, such as which researchers or groups can access the data, through the UI.

The Access Control component processes these restrictions and updates the sharing settings in the Database. An Authentication Check is performed to verify the identities of researchers or group members who are granted access. Once identities are confirmed, the restrictions are applied to the data in the Database, and a confirmation message is displayed to the Researcher through the UI.

This diagram assumes that there are well-defined interactions and data flows between the UI, authentication module, data management system, access control mechanisms, and the database. The exact details might vary based on the project's specific implementation details, requirements, and architecture.

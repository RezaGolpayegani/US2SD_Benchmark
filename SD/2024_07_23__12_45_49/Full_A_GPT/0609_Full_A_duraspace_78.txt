Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story focuses on capturing the interactions between the repository manager, DIMS, and possibly other systems or components involved in indicating external versions or descriptions of a resource. Given the nature of the request, the sequence diagram will illustrate foundational steps without delving into specific technical implementations, which can vary widely.

Below is a PlantUML code representation of the sequence diagram for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as DI
participant "Metadata Management" as MM
participant "External Links" as EL
participant "DAMS Database" as DB

RM -> DI : Select Resource
activate DI
DI -> MM : Request Metadata Form
activate MM
MM -> DI : Provide Metadata Form
DI -> RM : Display Metadata Form
deactivate MM

RM -> DI : Enter External Descriptions/Versions
activate DI
DI -> EL : Process External Descriptions/Versions
activate EL
EL -> DB : Update Metadata with External Links
activate DB
DB -> EL : Confirm Update
deactivate DB
EL -> DI : Update Confirmed
deactivate EL
DI -> RM : Display Confirmation Message
deactivate DI
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the repository manager selecting the resource they want to indicate external versions or descriptions for. Here's a brief explanation of the steps visualized in the PlantUML code:

1. **Repository Manager selects the Resource:** The repository manager initiates the process by selecting the resource within the DIMS interface for which they want to indicate external versions or descriptions.

2. **Metadata Management Component is requested:** The DIMS interface requests the metadata management system to provide a form for entering metadata, including fields for external links or descriptions.

3. **Entering External Descriptions/Versions:** The repository manager enters information about external versions or descriptions into the provided fields in the metadata form.

4. **Processing external links:** The entered information is processed, and the DIMS system updates the resource's metadata to include the external descriptions or versions, typically by updating a database that holds the DAMS metadata.

5. **Confirmation:** Once the external links are successfully added to the resource's metadata, the repository manager receives a confirmation message.

Each interaction step is designed to represent a high-level overview of the process, assuming a typical digital asset management system configuration with features for metadata management and external links integration. The "External Links" component represents a functional part of the system responsible for managing links to external resources, version descriptions, or any other relevant external information related to the digital assets.

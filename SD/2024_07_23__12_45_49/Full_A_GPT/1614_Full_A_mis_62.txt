Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a superuser, I want to enter and exit the superuser scope" involves outlining the interactions between the superuser and the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) when the superuser enters and exits their special access or administrative mode. This PlantUML code snippet illustrates these interactions.

Please, be aware that the sequence of actions might need adjustments to align perfectly with the specific implementations and requirements of your EDRMS project. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Superuser as user
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Superuser Scope" as superScope
participant "EDRMS Interface" as interface

== Enter Superuser Scope ==
user -> auth : Enter credentials
auth -> superScope : Validate credentials
activate superScope
superScope --> user : Access Granted
user -> interface : Access Superuser Functions
activate interface
interface -> superScope : Fetch Superuser Privileges
superScope --> interface : Privileges Listed
interface --> user : Display Superuser Interface

== Exit Superuser Scope ==
user -> interface : Exit Superuser Mode
deactivate interface
interface -> superScope : Logout
deactivate superfittingScope
superScope --> user : Confirmation
user --> auth : Logout
deactivate auth
auth --> user : Logged Out

```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The superuser initiates the process by entering their credentials to the Authentication System (could be via a login page or command).
2. The Authentication System validates these credentials and, if correct, grants access to the Superuser Scope.
3. Once in the Superuser Scope, the EDRMS Interface fetches and displays the available superuser privileges/functions to the superuser.
4. The superuser interacts with the EDRMS Interface, utilizing the superuser privileges.
5. When the superuser decides to exit the superuser scope, they initiate a logout sequence through the EDRMS Interface.
6. The EDRMS Interface then communicates the logout request to the Superuser Scope, which processes the request.
7. The Superuser Scope sends a confirmation to the EDRMS Interface, and subsequently, the interface notifies the Authentication System to logout.
8. The Authentication System finalizes the logout process and informs the superuser.

Please adapt the sequence of interactions and the naming of the components according to the specific architecture and terminology used in your EDRMS project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As an employee, I want to see contents of foods" involves illustrating the interactions among various components of the system to complete the task. This includes interactions from the employee's request through the UI, the system's backend processing, to fetching data from the database, and returning the food content information back to the employee. Below is a simplified representation using PlantUML syntax.

Please note, the diagram assumes that "contents of foods" refers to detailed ingredient lists or recipes associated with menu items. Adjustments may be needed based on the system's exact architecture and requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant UI as Interface
participant Backend as Server
participant Database

Employee -> Interface : Selects "View Food Contents"
Interface -> Server : Request food contents
activate Server
Server -> Database : Query food details
activate Database
Database --> Server : Return food details
deactivate Database
Server --> Interface : Display food contents
deactivate Server
Interface --> Employee : Show food contents on screen
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Steps:
1. **Employee Interaction**: The sequence starts with the employee selecting an option to view the contents of food through the user interface (UI) of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.
2. **Request Handling**: The UI layer receives the input and forwards a request to the backend server to fetch the specific details about food contents.
3. **Backend Processing**: The backend server, upon receiving the request, formulates a query to retrieve the relevant food contents from the database.
4. **Database Querying**: The database processes the query sent by the server and returns the information about the food's contents, such as ingredients and quantities.
5. **Response Forwarding**: The backend server receives the food details from the database and sends this information back to the UI.
6. **Display Information**: Finally, the UI presents the contents of the food to the employee on the screen.

This sequence diagram uses a simple flow but can be expanded to include error handling, user authentication, and more detailed interactions based on the system's complexity and requirements.

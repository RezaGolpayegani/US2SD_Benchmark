Given the specifics of your request, below is a PlantUML format sequence diagram that illustrates how a Database/Information Retrieval (DB/IR) administrator might search for administrator accounts using full or partial email or name. Please note that this diagram assumes a general process and might need adjustments to fit the specific architecture and technologies used at Cornell University.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor DBIRAdmin as "DB/IR Admin"

participant UISystem as "UI System"
participant Controller as "Search Controller"
database AccountDB as "Accounts Database"

DBIRAdmin -> UISystem : Enter search query (name/email)
UISystem -> Controller : SearchRequest(query)
activate Controller

Controller -> AccountDB : FindAccountsByQuery(query)
activate AccountDB
AccountDB --> Controller : AccountsList
deactivate AccountDB

Controller --> UISystem : DisplayResults(AccountsList)
deactivate Controller

UISystem --> DBIRAdmin : Show search results

@enduml
```

This diagram provides a high-level sequence of events:
1. **DB/IR Admin** inputs a search query, which can be a full or partial name or email, into the **UI System**.
2. The **UI System** sends this query to the **Search Controller**.
3. The **Search Controller** processes the request and queries the **Accounts Database** for matching administrator accounts based on the given input.
4. The **Accounts Database** returns a list of accounts that match the search criteria.
5. The **Search Controller** sends these results back to the **UI System**.
6. The **UI System** finally displays these search results to the **DB/IR Admin**.

Please adjust the sequence diagram as needed based on your project's technology stack, specific components, or additional requirements.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to calculate the fee for delayed book return," in PlantUML format, we will outline the interactions between various system components that are involved in the process of calculating the fee for delayed book returns. This involves the librarian initiating the fee calculation, the system fetching the due date and the current date, calculating the days late, determining the fee based on the days late, and then displaying or notifying the librarian of the calculated fee.

Below is a basic PlantUML sequence diagram that captures this user scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem" as system
database "Database" as db

librarian -> system : Initiate fee calculation\nfor delayed return
system -> db : Get book return\ndetails (due date)
db -> system : Return due date
system -> system : Calculate current date
system -> system : Compute days late\nand applicable fee
system -> librarian : Display late return fee

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the **Librarian** taking an action to initiate the fee calculation for a delayed book return. The **Library Management System** then interacts with the **Database** to fetch the return details of the book, including the due date. Once the due date is retrieved, the system calculates the current date and computes the number of days late based on the due date. Using this information, it then calculates the applicable late fee. Finally, the system displays the calculated late return fee to the **Librarian**.

This is a simplified view focusing on the core interactions for calculating fees for delayed book returns. Depending on specific requirements, such as varying fee structures or notifications to the borrower, additional steps and components might be integrated into this process.

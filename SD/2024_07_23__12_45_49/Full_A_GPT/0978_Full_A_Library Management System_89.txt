Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see all book names" involves representing the interactions between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) and the librarian. This sequence illustrates the process from the librarian's request to view all book names to the system's response displaying the requested information.

To represent this in PlantUML format, follow these steps:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as librarian
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

librarian -> UI : Request to view all book names
UI -> Backend : Fetch all book names
Backend -> DB : Query book names
DB --> Backend : Return book names
Backend --> UI : Display book names
UI --> librarian : Show book names list
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the librarian initiating a request to view all book names through the system's UI Interface. The request is then processed by the backend system, which queries the database for the names of all books. The database returns this information back to the backend system, which in turn sends it to the UI Interface to finally display the list of all book names to the librarian.

This PlantUML code visualizes the sequence of interactions that would occur in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) based on the provided project description for the specified user story.

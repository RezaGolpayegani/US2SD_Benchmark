Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a trainer, I want to show my rating up on my profile page, so that site visitors can choose wisely" involves illustrating the interaction between the trainer, system components, and database in adding and displaying the trainer's rating. Since PlantUML code can be text-heavy, here is a simplified version to convey the idea:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Trainer as trainer
participant "Profile Management System" as PMS
participant "Database" as DB

trainer -> PMS: Login
PMS -> DB: Validate Trainer Credentials
DB -> PMS: Credentials Valid
PMS -> trainer: Display Dashboard

trainer -> PMS: Request to Update Profile
PMS -> trainer: Display Update Form

trainer -> PMS: Submit Rating Update
PMS -> DB: Update Trainer Profile with Rating
DB -> PMS: Confirmation

PMS -> trainer: Display Success Message
trainer -> PMS: Request to View Profile
PMS -> DB: Fetch Trainer Profile
DB -> PMS: Trainer Profile Data
PMS -> trainer: Display Profile with Rating

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram follows through the process where:

1. **Trainer logs in**: The trainer accesses the platform and logs in.
2. **System validates credentials**: The Profile Management System (PMS) checks the credentials against the database.
3. **Trainer requests to update profile**: Once logged in, the trainer asks to update their profile.
4. **System displays update form**: PMS makes an update form available to the trainer.
5. **Trainer submits a rating update**: The trainer enters their desired rating into the form and submits it.
6. **System updates profile with rating**: The PMS processes this request and instructs the database to update the trainer's profile with the new rating.
7. **Success message**: Upon successful update, the PMS shows a success message to the trainer.
8. **Trainer views their profile**: The trainer then requests to view their profile.
9. **System fetches and displays updated profile**: PMS retrieves the updated profile data, including the rating, from the database and displays it to the trainer.

This code generates a sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction flow required for a trainer to update their rating on the community platform and for it to be visible to site visitors, fulfilling the objective of the user story.

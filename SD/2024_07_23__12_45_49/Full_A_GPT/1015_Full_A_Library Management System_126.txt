Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating the interactions between different system components and users in the context of identifying and managing reserved books in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Below is a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format, which describes the process of how a library manager would be informed about reserved books and how they can remind the members to return the books upon reaching the due date.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant LibraryManager as LM
participant CLMS_Interface as UI
participant Database as DB
participant NotificationSystem as NS
participant Member

== Identify Reserved Books ==
LM -> UI: Request reserved books list
UI -> DB: Query reserved books information
DB --> UI: Return reserved books list
UI --> LM: Display reserved books

== Send Reminder for Books Due ==
loop for each reserved book with due date over
    LM -> DB: Query member details for book {X}
    DB --> LM: Return member details
    LM -> NS: Prepare reminder message
    activate NS
    NS -> Member: Send Email/SMS reminder
    deactivate NS
end

### Explanation:

1. **Identify Reserved Take-Outs:**
   - The library manager (LM) requests a list of all reserved books through the Comprehensive Library Management System interface (UI).
   - The UI, in turn, sends a query to the system's Database (DB) to retrieve information on all reserved books.
   - The Database processes this query and returns a list of the reserved books to the UI, which then displays this information to the library manager.

2. **Send Reminder for Books Due:**
   - For each reserved book where the due date has passed, the library manager queries the Database again, this time for the member details associated with the reservation of book {X}.
   - The Database returns the requested member details to the library manager.
   - The library manager then instructs the Notification System (NS) to prepare a reminder message. This reminder is specifically about reminding the member to bring the book back as its due date is over.
   - The Notification System activates and sends an Email/SMS reminder to the member associated with the overdue reserved book. After sending the reminder, the notification system deactivates for this iteration.
   - This loop continues for each reserved book that is overdue to ensure all relevant members receive reminders.

This sequence diagram outlines a simplified high-level interaction for reminding members about their overdue reserved books. In a real-world scenario, additional steps such as authentication, error handling, and member response tracking might also need to be modeled.

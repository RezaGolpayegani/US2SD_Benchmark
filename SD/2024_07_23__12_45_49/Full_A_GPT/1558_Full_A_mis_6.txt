To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story mentioned, using PlantUML syntax, we will assume there are key components such as the User Interface (UI), Backend Service, and Database. The process involves the faculty member interacting with the UI, the UI communicating with the Backend Service, and finally, the Backend Service interacting with the Database. The scenario focuses on adding a date delimiter to refine search results.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant FacultyMember as FM
participant "UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

activate FM
FM -> UI: Enter search query with date delimiter
activate UI
UI -> BS: Send search request\n(includes date delimiter)
activate BS

BS -> DB: Query items with date constraints
activate DB
DB -> BS: Return search results
deactivate DB

BS -> UI: Display filtered search results
deactivate BS
UI -> FM: Show results within specified dates
deactivate UI
deactivate FM

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Faculty Member (FM) Interacts with the UI**: The sequence begins with the faculty member entering their search query along with a specific date delimiter into the user interface. This could be a request to find documents before, after, or between certain dates.

2. **UI Processing**: The UI layer captures this input and forwards it to the Backend Service. This includes both the search query and the specified date ranges as parameters.

3. **Backend Service (BS) Logic**: Upon receiving the request, the Backend Service constructs the appropriate query to fetch data that matches the search criteria, including applying the date delimiters effectively.

4. **Database (DB) Interaction**: The query is then executed against the repository's database. This database contains detailed records of all items, inclusive of their submission dates or relevant date fields.

5. **Result Processing and Display**: The database returns the filtered list of items that match the search criterion, which the Backend Service then sends back to the UI. Finally, the UI presents these results to the faculty member, effectively completing the action initiated by their request.

This diagram and the associated steps provide a high-level overview of the interactions and processes involved in adding a date delimiter to a search operation within the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS) as per the described user story.

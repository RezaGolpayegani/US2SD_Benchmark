Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to view reports on employee data" involves outlining the interaction between different objects or components in the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Given the scope of the project, I'll focus on illustrating the sequence of events from the manager's request through the system components involved in generating the employee data report.

The following PlantUML code sketch provides a basic outline of the sequence diagram. It assumes that the manager interacts with a web interface to request reports, which then triggers interactions with a backend system, a database, and potentially other services to gather and compile the necessary data.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Backend Server\n(Node.js + Express)" as Backend
database "Database\n(MongoDB/PostgreSQL)" as DB
participant "Report Generation\nService" as ReportGen

Manager -> WebUI : Request Employee Data Report
activate WebUI

WebUI -> Backend : Fetch Report(Data Request)
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Query Employee Data
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Return Data
deactivate DB

Backend -> ReportGen : Generate Report(Request Data)
activate ReportGen
Report0.3 +- Backend : Guidance on Report Format
ReportGen --> Backend : Report File
deactivate ReportGen

Backend --> WebUI : Report File
deactivate Backend

WebUI --> Manager : Display/Download Report
deactivate WebUI

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Manager Request**: The interaction begins when the manager requests an employee data report via the web interface.

2. **Web Interface to Backend**: This request is forwarded to the backend server, which is responsible for handling the logic behind data retrieval and report generation.

3. **Query Database**: The backend then queries the database for the necessary employee data. The choice between MongoDB and PostgreSQL depends on the database used for the project.

4. **Data Retrieval**: The database returns the requested employee data to the backend server.

5. **Report Generation**: The backend server sends the data to a report generation service, which could be an internal module or an external service, to compile the report. There's a brief interaction where the backend server might specify the format or template for the report based on managerial request or predefined settings.

6. **Report Delivery**: Once the report is generated, it is sent back to the backend server.

7. **Response to Manager**: The backend server forwards the report to the web interface, which then presents it to the manager. The manager may have options to view, download, or directly print the report.

8. **End of Interaction**: The diagram completes the sequence from the initial request to the delivery of the report to the manager.

This sequence diagram is a high-level overview and may require adjustments based on specifics such as the exact architecture of your system, any additional layers or services involved, and detailed user interactions with the web interface.

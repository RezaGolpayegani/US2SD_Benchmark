Creating a sequence diagram describing the process detailed in the user story requires representing the series of interactions between different entities involved in transitioning the cloud.gov hosting plan from a prototype to a FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) low environment. 

Given the complexity and technical nature of this task, this PlantUML diagram outlines the steps taken by an NSF employee, with support from the IT department and cloud.gov support, to make this transition. The sequence focuses on the interactions and decision-making process involved.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant ITSupport as IT
participant CloudGovSupport as CGS
database CloudInfrastructure as CI

E -> IT : Request hosting plan switch to FISMA low
IT -> CGS : Verify eligibility for FISMA low plan
CGS --> IT : Confirm eligibility and requirements

alt If Eligibility is confirmed
    IT -> IT : Review current prototype settings
    IT -> CGS : Initiate switch to FISMA low plan
    CGS --> IT : FISMA low plan activated
    IT -> CI : Apply necessary configuration changes
    CI --> IT : Configuration changes successful
    IT -> E : Confirm switch to FISMA low plan is complete
else If Not Eligible
    CGS --> IT : Provide reasons and guidance for eligibility
    IT -> E : Inform about eligibility issues and next steps
end

### Explanation of Steps:

1. **NSF Employee Request**: The process starts with the NSF employee requesting the IT department to switch the hosting plan to a FISMA low compliant environment.

2. **IT Verifies Eligibility**: The IT support team contacts cloud.gov support to verify if the current setup is eligible for a switch to the FISMA low plan.

3. **Confirmation of Eligibility**: Cloud.gov support confirms eligibility and provides any additional requirements needed for the switch.

4. **Review of Prototype Settings**: If eligible, the IT team reviews the current prototype settings to ensure compatibility with FISMA low requirements.

5. **Initiation of Plan Switch**: IT support initiates the process to switch to the FISMA low plan with cloud.gov support.

6. **Configuration Changes**: Once the switch is activated, necessary configuration changes are applied to the cloud infrastructure.

7. **Confirmation of Switch Completion**: The IT department confirms with the NSF employee that the switch to the FISMA low plan is complete.

8. **Handling Ineligibility**: If the setup is not eligible for a switch, cloud.gov support provides reasons and guidance. The IT department then communicates these details and next steps to the NSF employee.

This diagram simplifies the interaction between entities and assumes direct communication lines for clarity. Real-world processes may involve more steps and validations, especially concerning security and compliance requirements.

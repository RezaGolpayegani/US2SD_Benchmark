Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML format requires a deep understanding of the interactions between various components within the restaurant management system, especially regarding how a manager would check workers' work time. Below is a conceptual representation of this process in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Employee Management Module" as EMM
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> MI : Log in to system
activate MI

MI -> EMM : Request work time data
activate EMM

EMM -> DB : Query employee work times
activate DB

DB --> EMM : Return data
deactivate DB

EMM --> MI : Display work times
deactivate EMM

MI --> Manager : Show work time report
deactivate MI

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Manager Interaction**: The sequence begins with the Manager logging into the Management Interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.
2. **Request for Data**: Through the Management Interface, the Manager requests information about employees' work times.
3. **Query and Response**: The Employee Management Module processes this request and interacts with the Database to fetch the necessary work time data.
4. **Displaying Information**: The retrieved data is then sent back through the chain: from the Database to the Employee Management Module, and finally presented to the Manager through the Management Interface in a comprehensible report format.

This sequence diagram abstracts the process into high-level interactions, focusing on the roles of different components in the system without delving into the specifics of the database schema or the exact nature of the user interface elements. It's a conceptual outline meant to guide further design and development.

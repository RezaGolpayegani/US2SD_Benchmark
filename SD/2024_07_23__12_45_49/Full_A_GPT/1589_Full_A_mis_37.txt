Certainly! Below is a simplified PlantUML code sketching out a sequence diagram for the user story of a batch submitter wanting to provide their data and metadata in a simple, documented format to the repository staff for ingest into the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS). This example assumes the process involves a batch submitter preparing data and metadata, submitting it through a designated submission interface, and the repository staff processing the batch submission.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Batch Submitter" as BS
participant "Submission Interface" as SI
participant "Repository Staff" as RS
participant "EDRMS" as EDRMS

== Preparation ==
BS -> SI : Access submission guidelines
SI -> BS : Provide guidelines and template

BS -> BS : Prepare data and metadata according to template

== Submission ==
BS -> SI : Submit data and metadata package

SI -> RS : Notify of new batch submission
RS -> SI : Review submission details
SI -> RS : Provide submission data and metadata

== Ingest Process ==
RS -> EDRMS : Create new batch submission record
EDRMS -> EDRMS : Validate data and metadata format
EDRMS --> RS : Notify validation success/failure

alt If validation successful
    RS -> EDRMS : Initiate data and metadata ingest
    EDRMS -> EDRMS : Store data and metadata in repository
    EDRMS --> RS : Confirm successful ingest
    RS -> SI : Update submission status
    SI -> BS : Notify batch submission success
else Validation fails
    EDRMS --> RS : Report validation errors
    RS -> SI : Request data/metadata revision
    SI -> BS : Notify need for revision and provide reasons
    BS -> BS : Revise data and metadata
    note right of BS : Process loops until validation is successful
    BS -> SI : Resubmit revised data and metadata
end

In this scenario, the batch submitter initially accesses the submission interface to get the guidelines and template for data and metadata preparation. Once the data package is prepared, the batch submitter submits it through the interface. The repository staff gets notified of the new submission and can review the details before initiating the ingest process in the EDRMS. The system then validates the format of the data and metadata. If validation passes, the ingest process moves forward, and the data is stored in the repository, with the submitter being notified of the success. If validation fails, the submitter is asked to revise and resubmit their package.

This sequence diagram is fairly high-level and abstracts away some potential complexities and conditional pathways that might exist in a real-world system implementation to keep the focus on the primary flow described in the user story.

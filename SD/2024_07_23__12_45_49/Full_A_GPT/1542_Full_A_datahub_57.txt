Creating a detailed sequence diagram using PlantUML for the given user story requires the breaking down of the user interaction into distinct steps from the perspective of inviting someone to become a member able to publish data packages. The following PlantUML code outlines this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Owner
participant "UI/API Interface" as Interface
participant "Account Management Service" as AMS
participant "Email Service" as Email
database "Data Store" as DS

== Invitation Process ==
Owner -> Interface: Select "Invite Member"
Interface -> AMS: Request to invite new member
AMS -> DS: Check Owner Permissions
DS --> AMS: Permissions Validated

alt Member already exists in system
  AMS -> DS: Check if email is associated with an existing user
  DS --> AMS: User exists
  AMS -> Owner: Display Error: User already a member
else Member not in system
  AMS -> Email: Send invitation email to new member
  Email -> NewMember: Invitation Email Sent
  NewMember -> Email: Clicks on invitation link
  Email -> Interface: Redirect to Sign-up page
  NewOwner -> Interface: Completes Sign-up
  Interface -> AMS: Create new member account and associate with Publisher
  AMS -> DS: Store new member details
  DS --> AMS: Confirmation of member addition
  AMS --> Interface: Display success message to Owner
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram illustrates the steps involved when an owner wants to invite a new member to become part of their publishing team:

1. **Owner Initiates Invitation:** The owner selects the option to invite a member from the user interface.
2. **Check Owner Permissions:** The platform checks if the owner has the necessary permissions to invite new members.
3. **Invite or Error Handling:**
   - **Existing Member:** If the member already exists, an error message is displayed.
   - **New Member:** If the member is new, an invitation email is sent.
4. **Member Signup:** The invited member clicks on the invitation link, is directed to the sign-up page, and completes their registration.
5. **Account Creation and Association:** The platform creates a new member account and associates it with the correct publisher.
6. **Confirmation:** Success message displayed to the owner confirming the new member addition.

Ensure to adjust the diagram for the specific implementations and services your platform uses, as this is a generalized workflow tailored to the described user story and project requirements.

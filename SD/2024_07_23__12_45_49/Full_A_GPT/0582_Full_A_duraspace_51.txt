Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves mapping out the interactions between different actors and the system components in response to the repository manager's need to track events associated with content files. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines a possible sequence when a repository manager wants to know about any event that occurred to a content file for any of the repository's objects.

This sequence diagram assumes the existence of a DAMS (Digital Asset Management System) interface, an Event Tracking System that records and allows querying of events related to objects, and perhaps a Notification System to inform interested stakeholders about specific changes or events.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor RepoManager as "Repository Manager"
participant DAMSInterface as "DAMS Interface"
participant EventTracker as "Event Tracking System"
participant ObjectDatabase as "Object Database"
participant NotificationSystem as "Notification System"

== Event Inquiry for a Content File ==

RepoManager -> DAMSInterface : Request events for Content File X
DAMSInterface -> ObjectDatabase : Query object related to Content File X
ObjectDatabase -> ObjectDatabase : Retrieve Object ID
ObjectDatabase -> DAMSInterface : Return Object ID
DAMSInterface -> EventTracker : Query events for Object ID
EventTracker -> EventTracker : Retrieve events related to Object ID
EventTracker -> DAMSInterface : Return list of events
DAMSInterface -> RepoManager : Display events to Repository Manager

== Subscription to Future Events ==

RepoManager -> DAMSInterface : Subscribe to future events for Content File X
DAMSInterface -> EventTracker : Subscribe to Object ID events
EventTracker -> NotificationSystem : Setup notification for RepoManager
Note right of NotificationSystem : Notifications are configured\nto be sent to the Repository Manager\nfor any future events.
NotificationSystem -> EventTracker : Subscription confirmed
EventTracker -> DAMSInterface : Confirm subscription status
DAMSInterface -> RepoManager : Subscription successful message

This diagram represents a throughline where a repository manager interacts with the DAMS Interface to query and subscribe to events related to a specific content file. The DAMS Interface serves as the primary entry point, facilitating interaction with both the Object Database to identify objects and the Event Tracking System to log events and manage subscriptions.

The addition of a Notification System acknowledges a requirement for ongoing monitoring and alerting, thereby enabling the repository manager to stay informed of any occurrences without needing to manually query the system continually.

This sequence diagram can be expanded or modified based on the specific functionalities available within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS) and the complexity of interactions between the components.

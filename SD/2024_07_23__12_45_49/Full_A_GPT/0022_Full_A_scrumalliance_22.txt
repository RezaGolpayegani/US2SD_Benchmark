Given the requirement, here's a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the interactions between the user (Site Visitor), the system components, and the database for viewing and paging through a list of upcoming other courses.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteVisitor as Visitor
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Course Controller" as Controller
participant "Course Service" as Service
participant "Course Repository" as Repository
database "Course Database" as Database

Visitor -> UI: Access upcoming courses page
UI -> Controller: Request to view courses
Controller -> Service: Get upcoming courses(list, pagination)
Service -> Repository: Fetch paginated courses
Repository -> Database: Query for courses\nwith future dates
Database -> Repository: Return courses data
Repository -> Service: Process courses data
Service -> Controller: Return paginated result
Controller -> UI: Display courses list with pagination options
UI -> Visitor: Show list of courses\nand paging controls

alt Page Through Courses
    Visitor -> UI: Select page (next/previous)
    UI -> Controller: Request page change
    Controller -> Service: Get next/previous page of courses
    Service -> Repository: Fetch courses for requested page
    Repository -> Database: Query for next/previous\nbatch of courses
    Database -> Repository: Return next/previous courses data
    Repository -> Service: Process next/previous courses data
    Service -> Controller: Return paginated courses for requested page
    Controller -> UI: Update courses list to new page
    UI -> Visitor: Show updated list of courses\nand paging controls
end

**Explanation:**
1. **Visitor -> UI:** The site visitor accesses the upcoming courses page on the user interface.
2. **UI -> Controller:** The user's request to view the courses list is handled by the UI, which sends it to the backend controller.
3. **Controller -> Service:** The controller, responsible for processing HTTP requests, asks the service layer for a list of upcoming courses, possibly including pagination details.
4. **Service -> Repository:** The service layer, which contains the business logic, instructs the repository to fetch the required courses from the database.
5. **Repository -> Database:** The repository, responsible for data access, queries the database for courses with future start dates.
6. **Database -> Repository:** The database returns the data for the courses to the repository.
7. **Repository -> Service:** The repository sends the courses data back to the service layer.
8. **Service -> Controller:** The service layer processes the data (if necessary) and returns the result (including pagination information) back to the controller.
9. **Controller -> UI:** The controller sends the courses data back to the UI.
10. **UI -> Visitor:** The UI updates the courses list and displays it to the visitor, complete with paging controls if the number of courses exceeds the page limit.

**Alternate Flow (Paging through courses):**
If the visitor decides to page through the courses (e.g., view the next page), they interact with the UI's paging controls, causing a series of similar interactions focused on fetching and displaying the courses for the requested page.

This diagram captures an abstract view of the data flow for viewing and paging through a list of courses on a theoretical Scrum Alliance Community Platform project.

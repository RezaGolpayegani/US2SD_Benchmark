Given the project description and your request to generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story, here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format focusing on the process an Owner would follow to remove a member from their publisher organization within the Data Registry and Publishing Platform.

This example assumes a web interface facilitating the interaction between the owner and the platform. It includes steps for the owner logging in, navigating to their organization's page, selecting a member, and removing them from the publisher organization.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Owner
participant "UI Dashboard" as Dashboard
participant "Auth Service" as AuthService
participant "Organization Management" as OrgManagement
participant "Database" as Database

== Login Process ==
Owner -> Dashboard: Accesses Dashboard
Dashboard -> AuthService: Initiate authentication
AuthService --> Owner: Prompts login via GitHub/Google
Owner -> AuthService: Provides authentication details
AuthService --> Dashboard: Confirms authentication
Dashboard --> Owner: Displays main dashboard

== Navigate to Organization Management ==
Owner -> Dashboard: Selects 'My Organizations'
Dashboard -> OrgManager: Retrieve organization list
OrgManagement -> Database: Query organization details
Database -> OrgManagement: Returns organization information
OrgManagement --> Dashboard: Displays owned organizations
Dashboard --> Owner: Shows list of organizations

== Select Organization ==
Owner -> Dashboard: Chooses specific organization
Dashboard -> OrgManagement: Request organization details
OrgManagement -> Database: Retrieve organization members
Database -> Org379
Org3725
Jose-Management: Return member list
OrgManagement --> Dashboard: Show organization and members
Dashboard --> Owner: Displays organization details and member list

== Remove Member Process ==
Owner -> Dashboard: Selects member to remove
Dashboard -> OrgManagement: Initiate remove member
OrgManagement -> Database: Process member removal
Database -> OrgManagement: Confirm member removal
OrgManagement --> Dashboard: Update organization details
Dashboard --> Owner: Display confirmation of member removal

This diagram broadly covers the sequence of interactions initiated by an Organization Owner aiming to remove a publisher member through the platform. It begins with the owner logging into the platform, then navigating through the dashboard to their organization's management page, selecting a member to remove, and the backend processes that facilitate this action, including database interactions to ensure the member is appropriately removed from the publisher organization.

Note: Actual implementation details such as authentication methods, database structure, and the specific internal APIs of the services (e.g., "Auth Service," "Organization Management") might differ based on your project's architecture and requirements. This diagram is designed to provide a high-level overview and starting point for visualizing and planning the specified feature.

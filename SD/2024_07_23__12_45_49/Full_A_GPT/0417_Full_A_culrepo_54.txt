Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves representing the interaction between different system components and actors when a library staff member uploads material to the repository on the author's behalf. While I can't directly create visual content or runnable PlantUML code here, I can outline how the sequence diagram could be structured using PlantUML syntax. This outline will describe the flow of actions and can be used to generate a diagram using any PlantUML editor or tool.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryStaff as "Library Staff"
participant WebInterface as "Web UI"
participant AuthenticationModule as "Auth Module"
participant UploadService as "Upload Service"
participant Database as "Database"
participant NotificationService as "Notification Service"

LibraryStaff -> WebInterface: Access Upload Material Page
WebInterface -> AuthenticationModule: Request Authentication
AuthenticationModule -> LibraryStaff: Authenticate
LibraryStaff -> AuthenticationModule: Provide Credentials
AuthenticationModule -> WebInterface: Authentication Successful

LibraryStaff -> WebInterface: Select Material to Upload
WebInterface -> UploadService: Initiate Upload Process
UploadService -> Database: Check Author Permission
Database -> UploadService: Permission Granted
UploadService -> LibraryStaff: Display Upload Form
LibraryStaff -> WebInterface: Input Material Details & Files
WebInterface -> UploadService: Submit Material Details & Files

UploadService -> Database: Save Material Information
Database -> UploadService: Confirmation
UploadService -> NotificationService: Send Notification to Author
NotificationService -> Database: Log Notification
Database -> NotificationMore Service: Confirmation Sent

UploadService -> LibraryStaff: Display Success Message

This PlantUML script outlines a sequence of interactions starting from the library staff member accessing the upload material page, through authentication, uploading materials, saving those materials in the database, and ending with sending a notification to the author about the upload. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Library Staff Initiates Upload**: The library staff accesses the upload interface and is requested to authenticate.
2. **Authentication**: The library staff provides credentials which the authentication module verifies. Upon successful authentication, the upload process can begin.
3. **Uploading Material**: The library staff selects the material to be uploaded and inputs details about the material into the system through the web interface.
4. **System Processing**: The upload service checks with the database if the author has given permission for the library staff to upload on their behalf. Once permission is confirmed, the library staff inputs detailed information and files for the upload.
5. **Saving and Notification**: The upload service saves the uploaded material info to the database and triggers the notification service to inform the author that a new material has been uploaded on their behalf.
6. **Completion**: The library staff receives a success message indicating the material has been successfully uploaded.

This sequence diagram can be generated into a visual representation using a PlantUML editor or any compatible tool, providing a clear workflow of the user story described.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to renew the customer orders so that I can tell the chef new orders" involves illustrating how the different components of the system interact to achieve this specific functionality. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents this process. Note that this simplified diagram demonstrates key interactions and may not cover all potential error handling and secondary processes.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Waiter_UI as Waiter
participant OrderManagementSystem as OrderSystem
participant Database as DB
participant NotificationService as Notify
participant Chef_UI as Chef

Waiter -> Waiter_UI: InitiateOrderRenewal
Waiter_UI -> OrderSystem: UpdateOrder(orderDetails)
OrderSystem -> DB: CheckOrderValidity(orderId)
DB -> OrderSystem: OrderValid

alt If order is valid
  OrderSystem -> DB: UpdateOrder(orderDetails)
  DB -> OrderSystem: Confirmation
  OrderSystem -> Notify: SendOrderUpdateNotification(chefId, orderDetails)
  Notify -> Chef_UI: DisplayOrderUpdate
  Chef_UI -> Chef: NotifyChefOfOrderUpdate
  OrderSystem -> Waiter_UI: DisplaySuccessMessage
  Waiter_UI -> Waiter: ConfirmOrderRenewal
else If order not valid or update fails
  OrderSystem -> Waiter_UI: DisplayErrorMessage(Reason)
  Waiter_UI -> Waiter: ShowErrorToWaiter
end

```

This sequence diagram starts with the waiter initiating an order renewal through the Waiter UI. The Order Management System then proceeds to check the validity of the order in the database. If the order is valid, it updates the order with new details and communicates this update to the chef through a notification service which then displays the order update on the Chef UI. If the order is not valid, or the update fails for some reason, the system displays an error message to the waiter. This flow ensures that waiters can efficiently communicate new orders to the chef, thus maintaining a smooth operation within the restaurant.

The notation and commands used in this PlantUML diagram are standard for creating sequence diagrams. However, depending on the specifics of your system architecture or additional steps you wish the diagram to include (such as authentication, more detailed error handling, specific interactions with other system components, etc.), you may need to adjust or expand upon this template.

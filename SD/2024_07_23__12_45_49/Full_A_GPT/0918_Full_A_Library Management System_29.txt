Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to be able to update members' subscription plans" involves detailing the interaction between the librarian, the system (interface and server/backend), and the database that stores membership information and subscription plans.

Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to depict this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Library Management\nSystem Interface" as Interface
participant "Library Management\nSystem Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Librarian -> Interface : Selects member profile to update
Interface -> Server : Request member details
Server -> DB : Query member details
DB -> Server : Return member details
Server -> Interface : Show member details
Interface -> Librarian : Display member details

Librarian -> Interface : Inputs new subscription plan
Interface -> Server : Update request for\nsubscription plan
Server -> DB : Update subscription plan in member profile
DB -> Server : Confirm update
Server -> Interface : Update confirmation
Interface -> Librarian : Display update confirmation

```

Explanation of Steps:
1. **Librarian initiates the process**: The librarian selects a member's profile with the intention to update their subscription plan. This action is made through the Library Management System Interface.

2. **System queries and displays member details**: The interface communicates with the server to fetch the selected member's details from the database. The member's current details, including their existing subscription plan, are presented back to the librarian through the interface.

3. **Librarian inputs the new subscription plan**: After reviewing the member's details, the librarian inputs the new subscription plan information into the system through the interface.

4. **System updates the subscription plan**: The new subscription plan data is sent from the interface to the server, which then updates the member's profile in the database.

5. **Confirmation of update**: Once the update is successfully performed, the server sends a confirmation back to the interface, which then notifies the librarian that the subscription plan has been updated.

This diagram and the corresponding steps indicate a straightforward process for updating a member's subscription plan by interacting with a comprehensive library management system.

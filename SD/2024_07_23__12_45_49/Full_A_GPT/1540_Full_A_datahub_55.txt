Given your request, I'll create a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram code snippet to illustrate the process of an Owner updating their profile information on the Data Registry and Publishing Platform. This diagram will include interactions between the Owner, the User Interface (UI), and the Backend System.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Owner as owner
participant "User Interface" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend

owner -> ui : Selects "Edit Profile"
ui -> owner : Displays Profile Edit Form
owner -> ui : Updates information\nSubmits form
ui -> backend : Sends updated profile data
backend -> backend : Validates data
alt validation success
    backend -> ui : Confirmation Message
    ui -> owner : Displays success notification
else validation fails
    backend -> ui : Error Message
    ui -> owner : Displays error notification\nPrompts correction
end
@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Owner Interaction**: The Owner initiates the process by selecting the "Edit Profile" option in the User Interface (UI).
2. **Profile Edit Form Display**: The UI presents the Owner with a form to edit their profile.
3. **Submitting Updated Information**: After updating their information in the form, the Owner submits it.
4. **Sending Data to Backend**: The UI sends the updated profile data to the Backend System.
5. **Data Validation**: The Backend System validates the submitted data.
6. **Response Handling**:
   - If the validation is successful, the backend informs the UI, which then notifies the Owner of the successful update with a confirmation message.
   - If the validation fails (e.g., due to incorrect data format), the backend sends an error message to the UI, which then displays this error to the Owner and may ask for correction.

This diagram simplifies the interactions for clarity and focuses on the primary flow. It assumes successful authentication and access rights verification processes have already been completed.

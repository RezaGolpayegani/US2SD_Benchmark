Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story mentioned involves identifying the objects or actors involved in the process (such as the Camp Administrator, Camp Management System, Database, etc.) and illustrating how these entities interact over time to complete the process of modifying an enrolled camper's information. Below is a PlantUML code that represents this sequence diagram.

Please note that executing this code requires PlantUML software or access to an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor CampAdministrator as Admin
participant "Camp Management\nPlatform" as Platform
database "Camp Database" as Database

== Modify Camper Information ==

Admin -> Platform : Select Camper Profile
Platform -> Database : Fetch Camper Profile
Database --> Platform : Camper Profile Data
Platform --> Admin : Display Camper Profile

Admin -> Platform : Update Camper Information
activate Platform
Platform -> Database : Update Camper Record
activate Database
Database --> Platform : Confirmation
deactivate Database
Platform --> Admin : Display Update Success
deactivate Platform

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Camp Administrator (Admin) selects a camper profile to modify**: The process starts with the camp administrator selecting the camper profile they wish to modify on the Camp Management Platform interface.

2. **Camp Management Platform fetches the camper profile**: The Camp Management Platform sends a request to the camp database to fetch the selected camper's profile data.

3. **Camper Profile Data displayed to Administrator**: The Camp Management Platform receives the camper's profile data from the database and displays it to the administrator.

4. **Administrator updates camper information**: The administrator makes the necessary changes to the camper's information via the Camp Management Platform interface and submits the update.

5. **Camp Management Platform updates the camper record in the database**: The Camp Management Platform processes the updated information and sends a request to update the camper's record in the database.

6. **Database confirms the update**: The database updates the camper's record and sends a confirmation back to the Camp Management Platform.

7. **Administrator receives a success message**: Finally, the Camp Management Platform displays a success message to the administrator, confirming that the camper's information has been successfully updated.

The sequence diagram described above gives a high-level view of the interaction flow. The actual implementation may include additional steps for authentication, validation, and error handling to ensure the integrity and security of the data.

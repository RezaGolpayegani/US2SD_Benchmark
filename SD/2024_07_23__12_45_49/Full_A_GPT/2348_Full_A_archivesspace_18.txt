Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a user story that involves backend changes for bulk updating one ENUM value to another in PlantUML syntax involves defining processes such as receiving the user's request, processing the request in the backend, interacting with the database, and finally, confirming the successful update back to the user. Below is an example of how this can be accomplished.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "UI Layer" as UI
participant "API Controller" as Controller
participant "Service Layer" as Service
database "Database" as DB

== Bulk Update Enum Value Process ==

User -> UI: Selects enum values to update
UI -> Controller: Sends bulk update request

alt Validation Success
    Controller -> Service: Validates request data
    Service -> DB: Fetches target enum records
    DB --> Service: Returns enum records
    Service -> DB: Updates enum values en masse
    DB --> Service: Confirms updates
    Service --> Controller: Confirms success
    Controller --> UI: Displays success message
    UI --> User: Shows confirmation of bulk update
else Validation Failure
    Controller -> Service: Validates request data
    Service --> Controller: Returns validation errors
    Controller --> UI: Displays error messages
    UI --> User: Indicates failure & reasons
end

```

This sequence diagram starts with the user initiating the bulk update process through the UI (User Interface). The request is then passed on to the API Controller, which handles the request and forwards it to the Service Layer for validation and processing. The Service Layer communicates with the Database to fetch the target ENUM records and then requests a bulk update of those records. Upon successful update, the Database confirms the updates to the Service Layer, which in turn informs the API Controller. Finally, the UI is updated with a success message for the user. In the case of validation failure, the process returns error messages to the user through the UI, indicating the reasons for failure.

This PlantUML code is designed to visually represent the sequence of interactions among different components in the backend for a bulk update ENUM value feature, following the general objective of enhancing backend functionalities as described in the project description.

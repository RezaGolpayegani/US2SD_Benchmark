### Explanation:
- **Researcher**: Initiates the process by accessing the Neurohub web interface to create a new logbook page for an experiment.
- **Web Interface**: Acts as the frontend where the researcher inputs details and uploads files.
- **Logbook Service**: Manages the creation and updating of a logbook page in the database.
- **File Management Service**: Handles file uploads by storing file metadata and path in the database and then links the file to the relevant logbook page.
- **Database**: Stores all information related to the logbook entries and uploaded files.

The flow starts with the researcher accessing the Neurohub and ends with them either logging out or continuing their session after receiving a confirmation message that the logbook page and file attachment have been successfully created and stored.

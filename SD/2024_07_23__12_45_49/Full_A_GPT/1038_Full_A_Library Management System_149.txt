Given the specific request to generate a sequence diagram for the user story of a library member wanting to filter books according to their category in PlantUML format, the diagram would delineate interactions between the user (library member), the front-end user interface, the server, and the database management system involved in filtering books by category. Below is a simplified version of how such an interaction could be visualized using PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as user
participant "UI\nFrontend" as frontend
participant "Server\nBackend" as backend
participant "Database" as db

user -> frontend : Selects "Book Categories"
activate frontend

frontend -> backend : Request available categories
activate backend

backend -> db : Query categories
activate db

db -> backend : Return categories
deactivate db

backend -> frontend : Show categories
deactivate backend

user -> frontend : Choose a specific category
frontend -> backend : Request books in category [X]
activate backend

backend -> db : Query books in category [X]
activate db

db -> backend : Return books in category [X]
deactivate db

backend -> frontend : Show books in category [X]
deactivate backend
frontend -> user : Display books list

@enduml
```

In this scenario, the library member interacts with the user interface to select a desired book category. The front-end then communicates with the back-end server, which in turn queries the database for the available categories. The database returns this information to the server, which then presents it to the user through the front-end. Upon the member selecting a specific category, this process repeats, specifically to query and return books belonging to the selected category, ending with the display of the relevant book list to the member.

This sequence diagram represents a simplified version of what actual interactions might take place to support this functionality within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Additional complexities and functionalities, such as error handling, security checks, and more detailed interactions, have been abstracted for clarity and brevity.

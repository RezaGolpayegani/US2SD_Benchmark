Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for your specific user story requires depicting the interactions between various actors and systems involved in ensuring the right NSF people are invited to user interviews. Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that captures these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor UserResearcher as UR
entity "User Research\nManagement System" as URMS
database "NSF Staff\nDatabase" as NSFD
entity EmailSystem
participant NSFPerson as NSFP

UR -> URMS : Searches for potential participants\nbased on interview topic
URMS -> NSFD : Query for staff with relevant expertise
NSFD --> URMS : Returns list of potential NSF participants
URMS --> UR : Presents potential participants
UR -> URMS : Selects NSF participants for interviews
URMS -> EmailSystem : Sends invitation emails\nwith interview details
EmailSystem --> NSFP : Receives interview invitation
NSFP -> EmailSystem : RSVPs to invitation
EmailSystem -> URMS : Logs RSVP status
URMS --> UR : Confirms NSF participant RSVPs

This diagram represents the process after the user researcher decides on the topic for user interviews and requires inviting the correct NSF staff members to observe and make recommendations. Here's a breakdown of the actions depicted in the diagram:

1. The user researcher searches for potential participants based on the interview topic using the User Research Management System (URMS).
2. The URMS queries the NSF Staff Database for staff with relevant expertise.
3. The NSF Staff Database returns a list of potential NSF participants to the URMS.
4. The URMS presents these potential participants to the user researcher.
5. The user researcher selects the NSF participants for the interviews.
6. The URMS sends invitation emails with interview details to the selected NSF participants through the Email System.
7. NSF participants receive the interview invitation emails.
8. NSF participants RSVP to the invitation through the Email System.
9. The Email System logs the RSVP status and confirms back to the URMS.
10. The URMS confirms the NSF participants' RSVPs to the user researcher.

This sequence diagram focuses on ensuring the correct NSF staff members are invited to user interviews and can observe the process to make recommendations accordingly, emphasizing the communication and coordination process involved in conducting user research effectively.

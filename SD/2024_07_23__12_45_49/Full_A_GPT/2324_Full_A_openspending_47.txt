Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story provided involves outlining the interactions between different components of the system when an OpenSpending Community Member wishes to find examples of the use of fiscal data visualisations. Below is an example of how you can represent this scenario in PlantUML format, focusing on the main interactions such as accessing the app, fetching visualization examples, and displaying them to the user.

Please note, for simplicity, the diagram assumes that the app directly communicates with a backend server or API that serves the requested information. Depending on the actual architecture of the OpenSpending platform, there could be additional layers or services involved.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant App as A
participant "OpenSpending API" as OSA
participant "Visualization Examples Database" as VED

U -> A: Opens app
A -> OSA: Request visualization examples
OSA -> VED: Fetch examples data
VED --> OSA: Return examples data
OSA --> A: Visualization examples
A --> U: Display visualization examples

note over U: User browses\nvisualization examples
note over A: App provides guidance\non creating own visualizations

U -> A: Selects example for details
A -> OSA: Request detailed example data
OSA -> VED: Fetch detailed information
VED --> OSA: Return detailed information
OSA --> A: Detailed example data
A --> U: Display detailed example

note over U: User gains insights for\ncrafting own visualizations

This sequence diagram starts with the "User" who opens the app seeking fiscal data visualization examples. The app then communicates with the "OpenSpending API", which in turn requests the visualization examples from the "Visualization Examples Database". Once the database returns the requested data, the API sends it back to the app, which finally displays the visualization examples to the user. The user can browse these examples for guidance on creating their own visualizations with Open Spending data. Additionally, if the user selects an example for more details, the app requests and displays that detailed information, further aiding the user in their goal.

This diagram assumes a simplified flow for clarity and focus on the main interactions as per the user story provided. Depending on specific requirements, additional details and steps could be included, such as error handling and user authentication.

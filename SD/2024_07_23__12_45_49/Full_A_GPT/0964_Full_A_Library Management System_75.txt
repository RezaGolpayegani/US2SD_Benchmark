Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a librarian, I want to purchase books" involves outlining the interactions between the librarian, the library management system (CLMS), and any other entities involved in the process of purchasing books. The process is detailed from the point of the librarian deciding to purchase books, through searching, selecting, and finally purchasing the books to add them to the library's collection.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents these interactions in a sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "CLMS Interface" as Interface
participant "Book Management Module" as BookManagement
participant "Supplier System" as Supplier
participant "Finance Module" as Finance

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines the series of interactions that take place from the moment a librarian decides to purchase books for the library. It showcases the steps involved, including searching for and selecting books, confirming the purchase, dealing with the supplier, processing the payment, and finally updating the library's database with the new additions.

Please note, the interaction with the "Supplier System" is abstracted to a high-level interaction. Depending on the project's requirements, this could involve more detailed interactions, such as selecting a supplier, negotiating terms, or integrating with external systems/APIs for real-time book ordering and payment processing.

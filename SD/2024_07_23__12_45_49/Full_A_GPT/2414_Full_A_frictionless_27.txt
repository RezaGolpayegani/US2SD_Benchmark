Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story involves illustrating the interaction between different system components and actors to add general reference data to a narrow dataset. Below is a PlantUML representation of these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ResearcherGovernmentPublisher as r
participant "DPIE Web Interface" as web
participant "Data Integration\nModule" as integration
participant "Reference Data\nService" as refdata
participant "Dataset Validation\nService" as validation
participant "Metadata\nManagement" as metadata
participant "Data Storage" as storage

r -> web: Accesses DPIE Web Interface
web -> integration: Requests to add reference data
integration -> refdata: Fetches available reference datasets
refdata -> integration: Returns list of reference datasets
integration -> web: Shows available datasets
web -> r: Displays available reference datasets
r -> web: Selects desired reference datasets
web -> integration: Sends selection with dataset details
integration -> refdata: Retrieves selected reference data
refdata -> integration: Returns selected reference data
integration -> validation: Validates dataset with reference data
validation -> validation: Checks dataset integrity
integration -> metadata: Integrates reference data into dataset
metadata -> storage: Updates dataset with reference data
storage -> web: Confirms dataset update
web -> r: Shows success message

This sequence diagram starts with the Researcher or Government Publisher accessing the DPIE Web Interface, aiming to enhance their narrow dataset with general reference data. The process involves several steps, including the selection of suitable reference datasets, validation of the combined dataset, and updating the dataset with new reference data.

Note that the actual implementation details may vary based on the DPIE project's technical specifics, infrastructure, and the final user interface design. This representation gives a high-level overview of the steps involved from the perspective of a Researcher/Government Publisher wanting to enrich their data using DPIE.

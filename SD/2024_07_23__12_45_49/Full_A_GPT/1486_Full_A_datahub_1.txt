Creating a detailed sequence diagram covering the specific user story of a Publisher wanting to publish a dataset to be viewed by a few people involves highlighting interactions between the system components, the Publisher, and potentially a subset of the team or group with whom the Publisher intends to share the dataset. Hereâ€™s how you can structure this sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Publisher as pub
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Dataset Management Service" as dms
participant "Access Control" as ac
participant "Storage Service" as store
participant "Team Members" as team

== Authentication ==
pub -> auth: Sign in via OAuth
auth -> pub: Authentication Success

== Publish a Dataset ==
pub -> ui: Navigate to Publish Dataset
ui -> pub: Display Publish Form

pub -> ui: Submit Dataset Details\n(Private Visibility)
ui -> dms: Request to Publish Dataset
dms -> ac: Set Access Permissions
ac -> dms: Permissions Set
dms -> store: Save Dataset Info
store -> dms: Dataset Stored
dms -> pub: Dataset Published Successfully

== Share Dataset with Team ==
pub -> ui: Navigate to Dataset Settings
ui -> pub: Display Settings
pub -> ui: Select Team Members to Share With
ui -> ac: Update Access Permissions for Selected Users
ac -> ui: Access Updated
ui -> pub: Dataset Shared Successfully with Selected Team Members

team -> ui: Access Shared Dataset
ui -> ac: Verify Access Permissions
ac -> store: Access Granted
store -> team: Display Dataset

This sequence diagram starts with the Publisher signing in through an OAuth mechanism provided by an authentication service. After a successful sign-in, the Publisher decides to publish a new dataset and navigates to the publishing interface. Upon submitting the dataset details with the desired visibility set to private, the dataset management service takes over by setting the necessary access permissions and saving the dataset information to storage. Once the dataset is successfully published, the Publisher proceeds to share the dataset with a specified set of team members by updating the access permissions through the UI interface. The team members can then access the shared dataset, with the system verifying their access rights before granting them visualization of the dataset. This sequence diagram encapsulates the main interactions involved in publishing and privately sharing a dataset as per the given user story.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story "As a chef, I want to know customer orders so that I can prepare ordered food" involves representing the interactions between the chef (user), the Restaurant Management and Operations System, and related components for processing and displaying customer orders. Below is the sequence diagram in PlantUML code that illustrates these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Chef
participant "Restaurant Management\nand Operations System" as System
participant "Order Management Module" as OrderModule
participant Database

Chef -> System : Checks for new orders
System -> OrderModule : Retrieve new orders
activate OrderModule

OrderModule -> Database : Query new orders
activate Database
Database --> OrderModule : Return new order data
deactivate Database

OrderModule --> System : Display new orders
System --> Chef : Show new orders on chef's dashboard
deactivate OrderModule

Chef -> System : Select order to prepare
System -> OrderModule : Update order status to "In preparation"
OrderModule -> Database : Update order status
Database --> OrderModule : Confirm status update
OrderModule --> System : Notify order update
System --> Chef : Confirm order is in preparation

Chef --> System : Mark order as Ready-to-Serve
System -> OrderModule : Update order status to "Ready-to-Serve"
OrderModule -> Database : Update order status
Database --> OrderModule : Confirm status update
OrderModule --> System : Notify servers order is Ready-to-Serve
System -> Chef : Confirmation order is Ready-to-Serve

This sequence diagram starts with the chef checking the Restaurant Management and Operations System for new customer orders. The system consults the Order Management Module, which fetches new order data from the database. The fetched orders are then displayed to the chef via the System. When the chef selects an order to prepare and updates its status (e.g., to "In preparation"), this update is reflected back in the database through the Order Management Module. Along the serving process, once an order is prepared and ready to be served, the chef updates the order status to "Ready-to-Serve," which is again processed through the Order Management Module and notified to servers through the system. The sequence diagram illustrates the flow and interactions involved in managing customer orders from the chef's perspective within the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

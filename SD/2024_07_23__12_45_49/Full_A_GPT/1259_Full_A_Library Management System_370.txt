Given your request, here's a PlantUML code snippet to illustrate the sequence diagram for the user story: "As a student, I want to see the books that are currently unavailable so that I can arrange my reading plan."

This diagram assumes that the student interacts with a web-based library management system interface, which in turn communicates with the backend to fetch details of unavailable books.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Student as student
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend System" as backend
participant Database as db

student -> web : Request unavailable books
activate student
activate web

web -> backend : Fetch unavailable books
activate backend

backend -> db : Query unavailable books
activate db

db --> backend : Return unavailable books data
deactivate db

backend --> web : Provides unavailable books list
deactivate backend

web --> student : Display unavailable books
deactivate web
deactivate student
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes the process flow from the student's request through the web interface to access a list of unavailable books, how the system fetches this information from the database, and then presents it back to the student. 

To run PlantUML code and generate diagrams, you can use various tools or an online editor like the PlantUPL online demo. Remember that for running this code snippet, you'll need a PlantUML environment set up or use an online PlantUML editor.

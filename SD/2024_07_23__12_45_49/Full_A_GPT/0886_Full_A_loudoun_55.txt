Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the described user story involves illustrating various system components and their interactions as a county staff member initiates the process of creating a custom query or report outside of the common querying/reporting functionality. Below is a basic outline of how this process might be diagrammed in PlantUML, focusing on the steps a county staff member might take to fulfill a special request for information or reporting.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "County Staff Member" as staff
participant "User Authentication System" as auth
participant "Custom Query Interface" as customQuery
participant "Database" as db
participant "Reporting Engine" as reportEngine
participant "Report" as report

== Authentication ==
staff -> auth: Authenticate
auth --> staff: Authentication Success

== Initiate Custom Query Creation ==
staff -> customQuery: Access Custom Query Module
customQuery --> staff: Display Custom Query Form

== Submit Custom Query Details ==
staff -> customQuery: Submit Query Parameters
customQuery -> db: Parse Query Parameters
db --> customQuery: Validate & Process Query Parameters
customQuery --> staff: Confirm Query Submission

== Generate Report ==
customQuery -> reportEngine: Request Report Generation
reportEngine -> db: Fetch Data
db --> reportEngine: Return Data
reportEngine -> report: Compile Data into Report
report --> customQuery: Report Ready

== Deliver Report ==
customQuery --> staff: Provide Report Download Link
staff -> report: Download Report
report --> staff: Report Downloaded

This sequence diagram describes the following steps:
1. **Authentication**: The county staff member authenticates with the system, ensuring that they have the necessary permissions to create custom queries and reports.
2. **Initiate Custom Query Creation**: Once authenticated, the staff member accesses the Custom Query Module, which provides the functionality to create reports beyond the common querying/reporting features.
3. **Submit Custom Query Details**: The staff submits the parameters of the custom query, which involves specifying the data they wish to extract or report on.
4. **Generate Report**: The system, through its reporting engine, processes the custom query, fetches the relevant data from the database, and compiles it into a report.
5. **Deliver Report**: Once the report is generated, the system provides the staff member with a link to download the report. The staff member downloads the report, completing the process.

This sequence diagram demonstrates a high-level view of how a county staff member might interact with various system components to fulfill a request for a custom query or report. Depending on specific requirements or system complexities, additional steps or components may be added.

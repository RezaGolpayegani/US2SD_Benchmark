Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format requires a good understanding of the interactions between various system components and the user. The following example outlines a simplified interaction process for an archivist who wants to select existing rights statuses and statements to easily create uniform rights statements. This sequence assumes the existence of a digital archive management system with user authentication, a rights management module, and a database of predefined rights statuses and statements.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant AuthenticationModule as Auth
participant RightsManagementInterface as RMI
participant RightsDatabase as RD

A -> Auth: Login()
activate Auth
Auth --> A: AuthenticationSuccess
deactivate Auth

A -> RMI: AccessRightsManagement()
activate RMI
RMI -> RD: FetchRightsStatusesAndStatements()
activate RD
RD --> RMI: RightsDetails
deactivate RD

RMI --> A: DisplayRightsStatusesAndStatements()
deactivate RMI

A -> RMI: SelectRightsDetails()
activate RMI
A -> RMI: CreateUniformRightsStatement()
RMI -> RD: SaveNewRightsStatement()
activate RD
RD --> RMI: Confirmation
deactivate RD

RMI --> A: ConfirmationMessage()
deactivate RMI

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

1. **Archivist (A) Logs In**: The archivist starts by logging into the system, interacting with the Authentication Module (Auth). The system verifies the archivist's credentials and grants access.

2. **Access Rights Management Interface (RMI)**: After successful login, the archivist navigates to the Rights Management Interface to manage rights statuses and statements.

3. **Fetch Rights Statuses and Statements**: The RMI requests the existing rights statuses and statements from the Rights Database (RD), which then retrieves and returns the requested details.

4. **Display Rights Options**: The RMI displays the fetched rights statuses and statements to the archivist, allowing them to review the options available.

5. **Select and Create Uniform Rights Statement**: The archivist selects the appropriate rights details from the options provided and requests to create a uniform rights statement, which might be a new combination or selection of the existing ones.

6. **Save New Statement**: The RMI sends the new rights statement details to the RD to save it. The RD confirms the action after saving the new statement.

7. **Confirmation Message**: The RMI displays a confirmation message to the archivist that the new uniform rights statement has been successfully created and saved.

This sequence diagram simplifies the process and focuses on the main interactions for the given user story. Depending on the system's complexity, more details and steps might be needed for a comprehensive design.

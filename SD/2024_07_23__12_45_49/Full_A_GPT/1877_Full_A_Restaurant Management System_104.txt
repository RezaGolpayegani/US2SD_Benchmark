To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a manager, I want to change the price of items so that I can apply discounts," using PlantUML notation, you will need to depict the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Below is a basic example of how these interactions could be organized in a PlantUML sequence diagram.

Remember, this diagram is a simplified representation. The actual sequence and components might vary based on specific system designs and needs.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant UIManager as UI
participant Backend as B
participant Database as DB

M -> UI : Access Pricing Module
activate M
activate UI

UI -> B : Request current item prices
activate B

B -> DB : Query current item prices
activate DB

DB --> B : Return item prices
deactivate DB

B --> UI : Display item prices
deactivate B

M -> UI : Specify new prices and discounts
activate UI

UI -> B : Submit updated prices and discounts
activate B

B -> DB : Update item prices and discounts
activate DB

DB --> B : Confirm price update
deactivate DB

B --> UI : Display success message
deactivate B

UI --> M : Confirm price changes
deactivate M
deactivate UI

```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Manager to UIManager**: The sequence begins with the manager accessing the pricing module through the UI (User Interface).
2. **UIManager to Backend**: The UI requests the current prices of items from the backend server.
3. **Backend to Database**: The backend then queries the database for the current prices.
4. **Database to Backend**: The database returns the current item prices to the backend.
5. **Backend to UIManager**: The backend passes this information back to the UI, where it's displayed to the manager.
6. **Manager to UIManager**: The manager specifies the new prices and any discounts to be applied.
7. **UIManager to Backend**: The UI submits these updated prices and discounts to the backend.
8. **Backend to Database**: The backend updates the item prices and discounts in the database.
9. **Database to Backend**: The database confirms the updates.
10. **Backend to UIManager**: The backend then sends a success message back to the UI.
11. **UIManager to Manager**: Finally, the UI confirms the price changes to the manager.

This sequence ensures that the process of changing item prices and applying discounts is handled smoothly and accurately, involving several system components to ensure data consistency and user feedback.

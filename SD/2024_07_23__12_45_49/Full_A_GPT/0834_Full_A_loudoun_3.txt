Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story involves detailing the interactions among several entities or objects such as the Applicant (user), the Portal Interface, Application System, and possibly an Assistance Coordinator or System, as part of the pre-application assistance process.

While I cannot directly create graphical elements or diagrams through this text-based interface, I can certainly help by providing the PlantUML code necessary to generate a detailed sequence diagram for your scenario.

### PlantUML Sequence Diagram Code

Below is the PlantUML code for your user story, "As an Applicant, I want to Request Pre-Application Assistance, so that I can receive a response to a request for a meeting or information that is a result of the pre-application assistance."

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Applicant
participant PortalInterface as "Portal Interface"
participant ApplicationSystem as "Application System"
participant AssistanceCoordinator as "Assistance Coordinator"

Applicant -> PortalInterface : Navigate to Pre-Application Assistance
PortalInterface -> ApplicationSystem : Request Form for Pre-Application Assistance
activate ApplicationSystem
ApplicationSystem -> PortalInterface : Display Pre-Application Assistance Form
PortalInterface -> Applicant : Form Presented to Applicant
Applicant -> PortalInterface : Submit Pre-Application Assistance Request\n(Fill form and submit)
PortalInterface -> ApplicationSystem : Process Assistance Request
activate ApplicationSystem

ApplicationSystem -> AssistanceCoordinator : Assign Request
deactivate ApplicationSystem
activate AssistanceCoordinator

AssistanceCoordinator -> AssistanceCoordinator : Review Request \n and Prepare Response
AssistanceCoordinator -> ApplicationSystem : Notify of Response Prepared
deactivate AssistanceCoordinator
activate ApplicationSystem

ApplicationSystem -> PortalInterface : Update Status & Notify Applicant
PortalInterface -> Applicant : Notification of Response &\nInstruction for Next Steps

### Instructions to Generate the Diagram

1. **Copy the PlantUML code**: Select and copy the entire block of code provided above.
2. **Visit a PlantUML Editor**: Go to an online PlantUML editor or tool that can render PlantUML code. Examples include the official PlantUML web server, PlantText.com, or plugins available for many IDEs.
3. **Paste the Code and Render**: Paste the copied PlantUML code into the editor and render the diagram by following the specific instructions of the editor you are using.

This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of actions initiated by the applicant who wants to request pre-application assistance, from navigating to the relevant section on the portal, through form submission, to the assignment of their request to an assistance coordinator, and eventually receiving a notification with response and instructions for next steps.

Remember, the diagram is a high-level representation. You might need to adjust details according to the specific implementations, systems, or interactions unique to your project.

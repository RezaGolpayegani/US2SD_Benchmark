Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to be able to edit store orders" involves depicting the interactions among different system components and actors to execute this functionality. Since PlantUML syntax isn't visually representable here, I'll guide you through how the diagram would be structured in PlantUML code. For the sake of clarity, this sequence will involve the following steps: a manager initiates the order edit request, the system verifies permissions, loads the specified order, allows changes to be made, and then saves the updated order.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Authorization Service" as Auth
database "Order Database" as DB
participant "Order Management System" as OMS

M -> Auth : Request to edit order [Order ID]
Auth -> Auth : Verify manager permissions
Auth --> M : Permissions Granted

M -> OMS : Edit Order Request [Order ID]
OMS -> DB : Fetch Order Details [Order ID]
DB --> OMS : Order Details

OMS --> M : Display Order Details
M -> M : Modify Order Details
M -> OMS : Save Updated Order [Updated Details]

OMS -> DB : Update Order [Updated Details]
DB --> OMS : Confirmation

OMS --> M : Order Updated Successfully

### Explanation:
1. **Manager (M):** Initiates the process by requesting to edit an order, specifying the Order ID.
2. **Authorization Service (Auth):** Responsible for verifying if the manager has the necessary permissions to edit orders. If permissions are verified, the process proceeds.
3. **Order Management System (OMS):** Acts as the intermediary that handles the request to edit the order. It communicates with both the manager and the database.
4. **Order Database (DB):** Stores all order details and is queried to fetch and update the specific orderâ€™s details.

### Breakdown of Steps:
- **Verification of Permissions:** The sequence begins with the manager making a request to edit a specific order. The Authorization Service checks if the manager has the required permissions. If so, the process moves forward.
- **Fetching Order Details:** The OMS requests the current details of the order from the database to display them to the manager.
- **Modification of Order:** The manager views the order details and makes the necessary modifications.
- **Saving the Updated Order:** Once the modifications are complete, the manager submits the updated order details back to the OMS, which then updates the order in the database.
- **Confirmation:** The database confirms the update to the OMS, which in turn informs the manager that the order was updated successfully.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in editing a store order by a manager using the proposed Restaurant Management and Operations System. Remember, the actual implementation details may require additional steps based on specific business rules, error handling, and system architecture.

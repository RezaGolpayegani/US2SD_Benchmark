Based on the provided project description and focusing on the specific user story for a trainer wishing to highlight upcoming courses, below is a sequence diagram in Plant UML syntax. This diagram outlines the process flow from the trainer deciding to prioritize a course for visibility on the community platform, through to the actual visibility adjustment of the course that makes it noticeable to site visitors.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Trainer
participant "Trainer Profile Page" as TProfile

participant "Priority Setting" as PS
participant "Course Listings" as CL
participant "Visitor View" as VV

Trainer -> TProfile: Access Profile
TProfile -> CMS: Navigate to Course Management

end

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between a trainer, their profile management interface, the course management system, and how these actions translate into the heightened visibility of a particular course for site visitors. Note that the sequence includes decision points to account for the system's feedback to the trainer regarding the successful or unsuccessful highlighting of the course.

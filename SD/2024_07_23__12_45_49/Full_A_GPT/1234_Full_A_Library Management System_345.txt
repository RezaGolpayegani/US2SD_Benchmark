To visualize the interaction for the user story *"As a Staff, I want to display reservations of a member, so that I can keep track of reservations,"* here is a detailed sequence diagram written in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

title Display Member Reservations Sequence

actor Staff
participant "Reservation System" as RS
participant "Database" as DB

== Display Reservations of a Member ==

Staff -> RS : View Member Reservations
activate RS

RS -> DB : Query Member Reservations
activate DB

DB --> RS : Return Reservation Data
deactivate DB

RS --> Staff : Display Reservations
deactivate RS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:
1. The Staff initiates the process by requesting to view a member's reservations.
2. The Reservation System (`RS`) receives this request and queries the database (`DB`) for the reservation details of the specified member.
3. The Database processes this query and returns the reservation data to the Reservation System.
4. Finally, the Reservation System displays the retrieved reservation data to the Staff.

This diagram assumes a simplified view focusing on the critical interactions involved in displaying a member's reservations. Note that error handling, such as no reservations found or database access errors, is not explicitly shown but should be considered in a comprehensive system design.

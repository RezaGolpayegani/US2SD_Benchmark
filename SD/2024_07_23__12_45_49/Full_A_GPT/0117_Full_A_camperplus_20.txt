Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format requires breaking down the interactions involved in the process where a camp administrator manipulates and accesses information within the Camp Management & Communication Platform. The user story focuses on consolidating, managing and utilizing past and present camp data for future improvements.

Given the complexity and scope of features within this platform, the sequence diagram will focus specifically on the actions a camp administrator might take to input, update, and ensure the sustainability of administrative data for use by future administrators. Here's a simplified depiction of that process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "Admin Dashboard" as dashboard
participant "Database" as db

== Administrator Logs In ==
admin -> dashboard: Login()

== View Camp Records ==
dashboard -> db: FetchCampRecords()
db -> dashboard: CampRecords[]
dashboard -> admin: DisplayRecords(CampRecords[])

== Add New Camper Profile ==
admin -> dashboard: SelectAddNewCamper()
admin -> dashboard: InputCamperDetails(CamperDetails)
dashboard -> db: SaveNewCamper(CamperDetails)
db -> dashboard: AcknowledgeSave()
dashboard -> admin: DisplaySuccessMessage()

== Modify Existing Camper Profile ==
admin -> dashboard: SelectModifyCamper(CamperID)
dashboard -> db: FetchCamperDetails(CamperID)
db -> dashboard: CamperDetails
admin -> dashboard: UpdateCamperDetails(UpdatedDetails)
dashboard -> db: UpdateCamperProfile(UpdatedDetails)
db -> dashboard: AcknowledgeUpdate()
dashboard -> admin: DisplayUpdateSuccess()

== Archive Year's Data ==
admin -> dashboard: SelectArchiveYearData()
dashboard -> db: ArchiveCurrentYearData()
db -> dashboard: AcknowledgeArchive()
dashboard -> admin: DisplayArchiveSuccess()

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified workflow where a camp administrator manages camper information and archives yearly data within the Camp Management & Communication Headquarters Platform. Key activities include logging in, viewing camp records, adding new camper profiles, modifying existing camper profiles, and archiving the year's data for future use. 

**Note:** The actual interactions could be more complex, including error handling, security checks, and data validation processes which are not detailed in this simplified version. Additionally, depending on real-world requirements, the sequence might involve more user interactions or system processes, especially for comprehensive platforms like a camp management system.

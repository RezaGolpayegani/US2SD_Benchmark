Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactions between the system administrator and various components of the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS) when designating a user as a Repository Manager for a specific repository.

Given the nature of the request, we will assume a simplistic view focusing on the system's main components involved in this process. Here's how it can be represented in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "System Administrator" as admin
participant "User Management Interface" as umi
participant "Authorization Module" as auth
participant "Database" as db

admin -> umi : Access User Management
umi -> auth : Authenticate Admin
auth --> umi : Authentication Successful

umi -> admin : Display Users
admin -> umi : Select User
admin -> umi : Assign "Repository Manager" Role
umi -> db : Update User Role for Repository

db --> umi : Confirm Update
umi --> admin : Display Success Message

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Flow:

1. **System Administrator Access**: The system administrator accesses the User Management Interface. This step represents the admin initiating the process to manage user roles.

2. **Authentication**: The User Management Interface requests authentication of the administrator via the Authorization Module. This ensures that only authorized personnel can make changes to user roles.

3. **Display Users**: After successful authentication, the User Management Interface provides a list of current users to the system administrator.

4. **Select User and Assign Role**: The admin selects the user to be assigned the "Repository Manager" role and sends this request back to the User Management Interface.

5. **Update Database**: The User Management Interface communicates with the Database to update the selected user's role to "Repository Manager" for the specified repository.
  
6. **Confirmation**: The Database confirms the update, and the User Management Interface notifies the administrator of the successful role assignment.

This diagram and sequence represent a high-level overview of the interactions for assigning a user the role of a Repository Manager. Depending on the specifics of the CAMS, additional steps or components (e.g., logging, error handling) might be necessary for a complete implementation.

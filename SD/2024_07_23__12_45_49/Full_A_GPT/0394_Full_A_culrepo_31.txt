To fulfill your request for a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrating the user story of a Cornell faculty member wanting to find all items they have authored in the repository, the following outline provides the necessary steps in this process, including user actions, system responses, and backend interactions.

Please note, for simplicity, the sequence diagram code implicitly assumes certain functionalities like authentication, database access, and search capabilities are abstracted into high-level interactions. Here's how you might draft it:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor FacultyMember as FM
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Repository System" as RS
participant "Database" as DB

== Search For Authored Items ==
FM -> SI: Navigate to Search
activate SI
SI -> FM: Display Search Options

FM -> SI: Input name and select author search
activate RS
SI -> RS: Query for items by author name
activate DB

RS -> DB: Fetch items authored by the faculty
DB -> RS: Return list of items
deactivate DB

RS -> SI: Display search results
SI -> FM: Show items authored by faculty
deactivate SI
deactivate RS

```

### Explanation of the Sequence:
1. **FacultyMember (FM) interacts with the Search Interface (SI):** The faculty member starts by navigating to the search interface of the digital repository system.
2. **Display Search Options:** The system presents various search options to the faculty member, including the ability to search by author name.
3. **Input name and select author search:** The faculty member inputs their name into the search interface and specifies that the search is for items they have authored.
4. **Query for items by author name:** The search interface sends this query to the Repository System (RS), which handles the logic to interpret the search request.
5. **Fetch items authored by the faculty:** The Repository System queries the Database (DB) to retrieve all items associated with the author name provided.
6. **Return list of items:** The database returns the list of items that match the query.
7. **Display search results to the faculty member:** The Repository System processes the list from the database and sends it back to the Search Interface, which then displays the search results to the faculty member.

This sequence diagram assumes that the faculty member is already authenticated and authorized to perform this action if the system has such requirements. Moreover, this represents a simplified view focused on the core interactions for the user story provided. Depending on the system's complexity, additional steps like error handling, pagination of results, or further filtering options might also be part of the process.

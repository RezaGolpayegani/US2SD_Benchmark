Given your request for a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story you've mentioned, we will create a simplified diagram reflecting the process that could be involved in understanding the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the NSF Beta Site Development and User Research Initiative, focusing on its relevance to CMS decision-making and incorporating aspects that touch upon workflow needs. Please note, the sequence diagram is a high-level representation and might need detailed customization based on your project specifics.

This sequence diagram starts with a team member requesting clarification on the MVP features from the project lead. Following this, the project lead initiates comprehensive user research to understand the needs, which is critical for deciding on the MVP. The user research involves in-person interviews and CMS usability testing, the outcomes of which are used to determine essential CMS features. This information is used to analyze available CMS options, and recommendations are made based on how well they align with the MVP. Concurrently, a workflow analysis for the recommended CMS is requested to better understand how the CMS could support the content management process. Finally, insights from the workflow analysis are shared with the team member to help in assessing workflow needs in the context of the MVP development. This sequence diagram exemplifies a simplified process but highlights the importance of user research, CMS selection, and workflow analysis in understanding and defining the MVP for the project.

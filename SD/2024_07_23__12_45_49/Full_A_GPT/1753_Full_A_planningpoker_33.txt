To generate a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story, we will break down the process into steps. In this scenario, the main actors include the Participant (as the one observing estimates), Moderator (who can reveal estimates), and the AEPT System (which manages the game and estimation process). Here's an outline translated into PlantUML for the sequence you've described:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Participant
participant AEPT_System
participant Moderator

Participant -> AEPT_System: SubmitEstimate()
note right: Each estimator submits\ntheir own estimate
AEPT_System -> Moderator: AllEstimatesSubmitted()
note over Moderator: Verify if all estimates\nare submitted
Moderator -> AEPT_System: RevealEstimates()
note right: Moderator triggers to reveal\nall estimates at once
AEPT_System -> Participant: ShowAllEstimates()
note over Participant: Participant can now see\nall estimates simultaneously

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **SubmitEstimate()**: Each Participant submits their estimate to the AEPT System. This step is repeated for every Participant (or estimator) involved in the estimation session.

2. **AllEstimatesSubmitted()**: Once all estimates are submitted, the AEPT System checks and confirms the completion of this phase. It then signals to the Moderator that all participants have entered their estimates.

3. **RevealEstimates()**: The Moderator, upon realizing all estimates are in, commands the AEPT System to reveal the estimates to all participants.

4. **ShowAllEstimates()**: The AEPT System then renders the estimates to be visible to all participants at the same time, ensuring the independence of each estimate as no one could adjust their estimate based on what others have chosen.

This sequence emphasizes that the revelation of estimates happens only after all participants have submitted their estimates, aligning with the agile principle of making independent estimation to avoid biases. The logic is managed by the AEPT System, with the Moderator playing a crucial role in triggering the reveal, ensuring that the process is fair and transparent.

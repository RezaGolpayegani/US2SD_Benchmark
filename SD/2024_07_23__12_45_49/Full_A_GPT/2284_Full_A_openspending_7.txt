Certainly! Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram code to illustrate the user story of a Data Publishing User wanting to edit the source of data they've already imported to fix bugs or make enhancements in the API built for their data.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as user
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "API" as API
participant "Database" as DB

user -> UI : Selects dataset to edit
UI -> API : Request dataset details
API -> DB : Fetch dataset details
DB --> API : Return dataset details
API --> UI : Display dataset details
UI --> user : Show dataset details

user -> UI : Makes edits to data source
UI -> API : Submit edited data source
group Validation Process
    API -> API : Validate data format
    alt If validation fails
        API --> UI : Show validation error
        UI --> user : Display validation error
        user -> UI : Corrects data and resubmits
        UI -> API : Submit corrected data source
    else Validation passes
    end
end

group Update Process
    API -> DB : Update data source in DB
    DB --> API : Confirm update success
    API -> API : Trigger data processing
    alt If processing fails
        API --> UI : Show processing error
        UI --> user : Display processing error
    else If processing succeeds
        API --> UI : Notify update success
        UI --> user : Display success message
    end
end

This sequence diagram begins with the user selecting the dataset they wish to edit through the user interface (UI). The UI requests the details of the dataset from the API, which fetches this information from the database (DB) and returns it to the UI to display to the user. The user then makes the necessary edits to the data source.

Once the user submits the edited data source, the API performs a validation process on the updated data. If the validation fails, an error message is shown to the user, who must then correct the data and resubmit. If the validation passes, the process moves on to the update process.

During the update process, the API updates the data source in the database and triggers data processing. If the processing fails, an error message is displayed to the user. If the processing succeeds, the API notifies the UI of the successful update, and the UI displays a success message to the user.

This sequence diagram abstracts some complexities and assumes a straightforward update mechanism for the sake of clarity. Adjustments might be needed to cater to specific technical architectures or additional steps in your data processing workflow.

Creating a detailed UML sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a Staff, I want to search for a book by author, so that I can quickly search for an author's book" involves depicting the interactions among different system components in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to fulfill this requirement. 

Below is a sequence diagram, in PlantUML format, that represents the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Search Controller" as SC
participant "Database" as DB

== Search Book by Author ==

Staff -> SI: Enter author's name
SI -> SC: Request search by author(name)
alt if author name is valid
    SC -> DB: Query books by author
    DB --> SC: Return search results
    SC --> SI: Show search results
    SI --> Staff: Display books by author
else if author name is invalid
    SC --> SI: Show error message
    SI --> Staff: Display error (no results)
end

```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Staff Interaction:** The staff member starts the process by entering the author's name into the Search Interface. 

2. **Search Interface to Search Controller:** The Search Interface captures this request and sends it to the Search Controller, indicating that the staff wishes to search for books by a specific author.

3. **Decision Making:** An alternative path is depicted here based on the validity of the author's name input.
   
   - **If the author's name is valid:**
     - The Search Controller queries the Database for books by the specified author.
     - The Database returns the search results to the Search Controller.
     - The Search Controller then sends these results back to the Search Interface.
     - Finally, the Search Interface displays the list of books by the author to the staff member.
   
   - **If the author's name is invalid or results in no matches:**
     - The Search Controller directly informs the Search Interface of the failure.
     - The Search Interface then shows an error message or a "no results" message to the staff.

The sequence diagram highlights the simplicity and efficiency of searching for books by authors within the system, providing a straightforward pathway for staff members to access the information they need rapidly.

This UML sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of interactions that happen behind the scenes in the Comprehensive Library Management System when a staff member seeks to find books by a particular author.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format requires specifying the interaction between different system components and actors to fulfill the user story. For the user story, "As a library member, I want to learn unique identification number so that I can find a book by it," the sequence diagram needs to visualize how a library member interacts with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to discover a book's unique identification number.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that demonstrates these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor Member as M
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Library Database" as DB
participant "Book Details" as BD

M -> SI : Enter search query\n(title, author, category)
activate SI

SI -> DB : Fetch matching books
activate DB

DB --> SI : Return book list
deactivate DB

SI --> M : Display book list\nwith titles and authors
deactivate SI

M -> SI : Select a book
activate SI

SI -> DB : Request unique ID\nand details for selected book
activate DB

DB --> SI : Return unique ID\nand book details
deactivate DB

SI --> M : Display book details\nincluding unique ID
deactivate SI

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Member (M)** initiates the process by entering a search query through the **Search Interface (SI)**. The query could be based on the book's title, author, or category.
2. **Search Interface (SI)** processes the query and requests matching book information from the **Library Database (DB)**.
3. **Library Database (DB)** retrieves and returns the list of matching books to the **Search Interface (SI)**.
4. **Search Interface (SI)** displays the list of books, including titles and authors, to the **Member (M)**.
5. **Member (M)** selects a book from the list to learn more about it.
6. **Search Interface (SI)** requests detailed information, including the unique identification number of the selected book, from the **Library Database (DB)**.
7. **Library Database (DB)** returns the requested information, including the unique ID and other details of the book, to the **Search Interface (SI)**.
8. **Search Interface (SI)** displays the book details, including the unique identification number, to the **Member (M)**.

This sequence diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the interactions required for a library member to find a book by its unique identification number using the Comprehensive Library Management System.

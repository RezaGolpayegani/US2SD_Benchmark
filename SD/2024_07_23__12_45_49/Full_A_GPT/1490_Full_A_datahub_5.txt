Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML language involves representing the steps a Publisher would take immediately after signing up, to quickly get started with publishing data. This includes interacting with guides, managing a profile, and starting the publishing process. 

Given PlantUML's syntax and the scenario provided, below is a sequence diagram illustrating this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Publisher
participant "Signup Page" as Signup
participant "Profile Management" as Profile
participant "Data Publishing Guide" as Guide
participant "Dataset Publishing" as Dataset

Publisher -> Signup: Completes sign-up
activate Signup
Signup -> Profile: Redirect to Profile Management
deactivate Signup

activate Profile
Publisher -> Profile: Edits Profile Information\n(manage organization, roles)
Publisher -> Profile: Reviews Post-sign-up Guide
Profile -> Guide: Generates Guide for Publishing Datasets
deactivate Profile

activate Guide
Publisher -> Guide: Reads through Guide
Guide -> Dataset: Redirects to Dataset Publishing
deactivate Guide

activate Dataset
Publisher -> Dataset: Starts Dataset Publishing Process
deactivate Dataset

This diagram walks through the following steps after a Publisher signs up:

1. **Completing Sign-up:** The Publisher completes the sign-up process via the Signup Page, potentially using GitHub or Google integration.
2. **Redirect to Profile Management:** The Publisher is automatically redirected to manage their profile, a crucial step for setting up their publishing identity.
3. **Editing Profile Information:** The Publisher may need to edit their profile information, including managing organization members and setting roles.
4. **Reviewing Post-Sign-up Guide:** It's important that the Publisher reviews guides or onboarding materials tailored to help them understand how to effectively use the platform.
5. **Reading through the Guide:** This detailed guide contains essential information on how to publish datasets, including tips for ensuring data quality and leveraging platform tools.
6. **Starting the Dataset Publishing Process:** Finally, the Publisher proceeds to publish their first dataset, equipped with the knowledge from the guide.

The sequence diagram outlined above aims to visually represent the interactions between the Publisher and various components of the Data Registry and Publishing Platform, highlighting the immediate steps a Publisher would take after signing up to get started with dataset publishing efficiently.

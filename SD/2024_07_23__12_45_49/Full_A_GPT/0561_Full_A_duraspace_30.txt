Creating a detailed sequence diagram for this user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating the interactions between the user, the system components, and the backend processes to fulfill the user's request. Below is a basic PlantUML sequence diagram focusing on the user's journey to know what repository an object belongs to. This diagram captures the interactions starting from the user's query up to the system's response.

Note that this is a simplified version and might need adjustments to fit into a real-world implementation of DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS).

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "UI/Portal" as UI
participant "DIMS API" as API
database "DIMS Database" as DB

User -> UI: Request object repository info
UI -> API: Get info for Object ID
API -> DB: Query Object Repository Details
DB -> API: Object Repository Details
API -> UI: Object Repository Info
UI -> User: Display Repository Info

### Explanation:
1. **User:** Initiates the process by requesting information about which repository an object belongs to from the UI/Portal.
   
2. **UI/Portal:** Interface through which the user interacts with DIMS. Receives the user's request and forwards it to the DIMS API.

3. **DIMS API:** Serves as the middleman that processes requests from the UI and communicates with the database. It interprets the user's request and queries the database for the information.

4. **DIMS Database:** Stores all data related to the digital assets, including which objects belong to which repositories. Upon receiving a query, it retrieves the relevant repository details for the specified object and sends this information back to the API.

5. **Return Path:** The information flows back through the system in reverse order. The database returns the object's repository details to the API, which then forwards this information to the UI/Portal, which finally presents it to the user.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions between system components for the user story in question. Depending on the intricacies of the DIMS implementation, additional steps or components, such as authentication mechanisms or logging services, might also be integrated into the sequence.

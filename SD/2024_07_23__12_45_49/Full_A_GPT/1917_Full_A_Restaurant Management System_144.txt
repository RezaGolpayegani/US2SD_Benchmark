Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that details the process a manager might undergo to examine the spending ratio of specific products using the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This diagram outlines the interaction between the manager, the system's interface, the backend server, and the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Backend Server" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> MI: Request spending ratio of products
activate MI
MI -> BS : Fetch spending ratio data
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query product spending data
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return spending data
deactivate DB
BS --> MI : Process and calculate ratios
deactivate BS
MI --> Manager : Display spending ratio results
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

### Explanation:
- **Manager**: Initiates the process by requesting to view the spending ratio of products through the management interface.
- **Management Interface (MI)**: Acts as the intermediary that receives the manager's request and forwards it to the backend server for processing.
- **Backend Server (BS)**: Handles the logic of fetching and calculating the requested spending ratios. It queries the database for the necessary spending data on products.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores all the data regarding financial transactions, product costs, and sales. It returns the requested data to the backend server.

This sequence diagram skims over the complexity of the actual calculations and data processing but provides a clear overview of the steps involved in the process from a manager's request to receiving the spending ratio information. Each step is crucial for ensuring accurate and timely provision of the information needed to make informed decisions about menu pricing, cost control, and financial planning within the restaurant.

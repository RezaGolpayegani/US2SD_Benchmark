Given the complexity of creating a detailed sequence diagram in plain text, the following is an outline of how a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to create a table for workers' work time." could be structured using PlantUML syntax. This example assumes a basic interaction flow involving the Manager, the Restaurant Management System (back-end server), and the Database. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as mgr
participant "Restaurant Management \nSystem" as RMS
database "Database" as DB

mgr -> RMS : Access employee scheduling feature
activate RMS

RMS -> DB : Retrieve current employee schedules
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Current schedules
deactivate DB

RMS --> mgr : Display current schedules
mgr -> RMS : Input new work time table details
activate RMS

RMS -> DB : Update employee schedules with new work time table
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Confirmation of update
deactivate DB

RMS --> mgr : Display confirmation message
deactivate RMS

@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. **Interaction Start**: The manager accesses the employee scheduling feature on the Restaurant Management and Operations System.
2. **Retrieve Current Schedules**: The system retrieves the current employee schedules from the database to display to the manager. This step ensures the manager is aware of existing schedules before making any changes.
3. **Input New Schedule**: After reviewing current schedules, the manager inputs the details for the new work time table.
4. **Update Database**: The system updates the employee schedules in the database with the new work time table details.
5. **Confirmation**: Finally, the system confirms the update to the manager, completing the process of creating a new table for workers' work time.

Please note, this sequence diagram is simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, additional steps like authentication, error handling, and more detailed interactions (such as specifying which employees are affected and the specific shifts being assigned) would likely be necessary. Also, depending on the specific technologies and architecture choices, the sequence of interactions might vary.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process a library staff member would follow to use content and metadata from the repository in other systems or web pages. This diagram includes actors, systems, and interactions required to fulfill the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff" as staff
participant "Digital Repository System" as repo
participant "Metadata Management" as metadata
participant "Content Management" as content
participant "External System/Web Page" as external

== Use Content and Metadata from Repository ==

staff -> repo : Search for content and metadata
repo -> metadata : Retrieve metadata
repo -> content : Access content
metadata --> staff : Display metadata results
content --> staff : Display content options

activate staff
staff -> metadata : Select relevant metadata
staff -> content : Select specific content
deactivate staff

== Export and Integrate Content and Metadata ==

staff -> repo : Request export of selected items
repo -> metadata : Package selected metadata
repo -> content : Package selected content
metadata -> repo : Metadata packaged
content -> repo : Content packaged
repo --> staff : Provide packaged content and metadata

activate staff
staff -> external : Integrate content and metadata\ninto designated system or web page
deactivate staff

== Feedback ==

external -> staff : Confirm integration success
staff -> repo : Log activity and feedback(optional)

This sequence diagram details a workflow where the library staff member first searches for and selects the desired content and metadata within the digital repository system. They then request the export of these selected items. The repository system packages the requested metadata and content, which are then provided to the library staff member. Finally, the staff member integrates this packaged content and metadata into an external system or web page, with an optional step to log this activity and any feedback within the repository system for future reference or improvement.

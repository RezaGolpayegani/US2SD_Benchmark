To fulfill your request, let's create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a manager, I want to see the working hours of each employee so that I can pay each employee accordingly."

Please note that PlantUML requires a specific textual notation to visualize sequence diagrams. Below is a diagram expressed in PlantUML syntax that depicts the interactions between the manager, system, and database to view and process employee working hours for payroll purposes.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as manager
participant "Management Interface" as managementInterface
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

manager -> managementInterface : Access working hours report section

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events triggered by a manager wanting to view and process employee payroll based on the hours worked. Here are the steps outlined:

1. The manager accesses the working hours report section through the management interface.
2. The management interface, upon receiving the request, asks the backend server to retrieve all employee working hours.
3. The backend server queries the database for the required information.
4. The database calculates and returns total working hours for each employee.
5. The backend server provides this data to the management interface, which then displays it for the manager.
6. The manager initiates the payroll process based on the displayed working hours.
7. The management interface commands the backend server to process payroll according to the retrieved working hours.
8. The backend server fetches payment details for each employee from the database, calculates payroll, updates payroll records, and confirms the completion of the process back to the management interface.
9. The management interface confirms to the manager that payroll processing is complete.

Adjust the diagram according to your project's specific implementation details or technology stack.

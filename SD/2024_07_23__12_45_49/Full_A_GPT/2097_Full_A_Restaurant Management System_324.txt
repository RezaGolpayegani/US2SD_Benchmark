Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story involves defining the interactions between various system components across time. The user story you've provided focuses on enabling an employee to add comments for each order, aimed at gathering customer feedback on menu items for the restaurant owner's consideration.

Below is a simplified representation of how you might structure a Sequence inside PlantUML to fulfill this requirement. This example assumes a basic interaction flow where an employee inputs customer feedback into the system, which is then stored and made accessible to the restaurant owner or management for review.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant "Restaurant Management\nSystem" as RMS
participant Database as DB

E -> RMS : Selects Order to Comment
activate RMS

RMS -> RMS : Authenticate Employee
RMS -> DB : Retrieve Order Details
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Order Details
deactivate DB

RMS --> E : Display Order Details
E -> RMS : Input Customer Feedback
activate RMS

RMS -> DB : Save Feedback
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Confirmation
deactivate DB
RMS --> E : Display Success Message
deactivate RMS

@enduml
```

### Description of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Employee Initiates**: The process begins when the employee selects an order to add comments about customer feedback.
2. **Authentication**: The system authenticates the employee to ensure they have permission to add comments.
3. **Retrieve Order Details**: The system queries the database to retrieve details of the selected order.
4. **Display Order Details**: The management system displays the details to the employee.
5. **Input Customer Feedback**: The employee inputs the customer's feedback on the order.
6. **Save Feedback**: The system saves the feedback in the database associated with the specific order.
7. **Success Message**: Finally, the system confirms that the feedback was saved successfully and displays a success message to the employee.

### Notes:
- This diagram assumes that the employee has already been authenticated in the system and has the necessary permissions to add comments to orders.
- Depending on the complexity of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, additional steps or components could be involved, such as logging, error handling, or notifications to the restaurant owner.
- Adaptations may be necessary based on the actual system architecture and requirements, including more detailed interactions with cloud services or third-party integrations.
  
For actual use, depending on your specific project requirements, consider expanding on this basic example by incorporating error handling, detailed authentication mechanisms, or interactions with other system modules (like notifications for managers to review new feedback).

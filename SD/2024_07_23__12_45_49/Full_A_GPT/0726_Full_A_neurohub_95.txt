Given the intricacies involved in file sharing and ownership changes within a system like Neurohub, and based on the project description provided, below is a simplified representation of how a sequence diagram for the user story could be conceived using PlantUML syntax. This example aims to illustrate interactions between system components when a user attempts to change sharing and ownership settings for multiple files. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant UserInterface as UI
participant AuthenticationModule as Auth
participant FileManager as FM
participant Database as DB
actor User

User -> UI : Selects multiple files
User -> UI : Requests ownership/sharing change
UI -> Auth : Validates user
Auth --> UI : Success/Failure
alt Validation Success
    UI -> FM : Request file details
    FM -> DB : Fetch file details
    DB --> FM : File details
    FM --> UI : File details display
    User -> UI : Selects new owner/shares
    UI -> FM : Update request with new settings
    FM -> DB : Update file metadata
    DB --> FM : Update confirmation
    FM --> UI : Confirmation message
    UI --> User : Display success message
else Validation Failure
    UI --> User : Display error message
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **User Interaction**: The user selects multiple via the User Interface (UI) and requests to change their sharing and ownership.
2. **Authentication**: The UI sends a request to the AuthenticationModule (Auth) to validate the user's identity.
   - If validation is successful, the process continues.
   - If validation fails, an error message is displayed to the user.
3. **Fetch File Details**: Upon successful authentication, the UI requests the file details from the FileManager (FM), which in turn fetches this information from the Database (DB).
4. **Display File Details**: The fetched file details are displayed to the user, who then selects new ownership or sharing settings.
5. **Update Request**: The UI sends the updated metadata, including new ownership or sharing settings, to the FileManager.
6. **Metadata Update**: The FileManager requests the Database to update the file metadata with the new settings.
7. **Confirmation**: Upon successful update, a confirmation message is sent to the UI and displayed to the user.

This example can be further expanded or modified based on specific project requirements, system architecture, and user interaction flows defined for the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project.

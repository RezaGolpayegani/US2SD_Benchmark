To create a sequence diagram for the specified user story in PlantUML format, we'll first outline all the actors and components involved in the encryption process from the moment an admin decides to encrypt all data. This scenario involves the admin user, the RecycleSmart platform's backend server, the encryption service/module, and the database.

### Actors and Components:

- **Admin:** The person responsible for ensuring data is encrypted.
- **Backend Server:** RecycleSmart's server that processes requests and commands.
- **Encryption Service/Module:** A dedicated service or part of the platform responsible for encrypting data.
- **Database:** Where RecycleSmart's data is stored.

### Sequence of Actions:

1. The admin initiates the data encryption process.
2. The backend server receives the command to encrypt all data.
3. The backend server communicates with the encryption module to start the encryption.
4. The encryption module fetches the data to be encrypted from the database.
5. Data is encrypted.
6. Encrypted data is saved back into the database.
7. The database acknowledges the operation.
8. The backend server receives confirmation of successful encryption.
9. The admin is notified that the data encryption is complete.

### PlantUML Code:

Below is the PlantUML code that represents the sequence diagram for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Admin
participant "Backend Server" as Server
participant "Encryption Service/Module" as Encryption
database Database

Admin -> Server: Initiate encryption
Server -> Encryption: Start encryption process
Encryption -> Database: Fetch data to encrypt
Database --> Encryption: Data
Encryption -> Encryption: Encrypt data
Encryption -> Database: Save encrypted data
Database --> Encryption: Acknowledge save
Encryption --> Server: Encryption successful
Server --> Admin: Notify encryption completion

@enduml
```

This code creates a sequence diagram showing the flow of actions starting from the admin's intention to encrypt the data, through the backend server, encryption module/service, and database, ending with the admin being notified of the encryption completion. It encapsulates the process of ensuring data is encrypted to protect sensitive information in the event of a server breach or attack.

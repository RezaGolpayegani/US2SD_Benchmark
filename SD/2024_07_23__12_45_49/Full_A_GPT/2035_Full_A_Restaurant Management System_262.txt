Given the user story and the context mentioned in the project description, here's a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format for tracking the Employee Check-In information by a restaurant manager to track down working hours and improve labor management efficiency. Please note, to view this diagram, you need to use a Plant UML viewer or any tool that supports Plant UML syntax.

### Explanation of the Diagram:
- The **Manager** interacts with the **Employee Management System** (EMS) to track employee check-in information and analyze working hours for improving labor management efficiency.
- Initially, the Manager logs in, and the EMS validates the Manager's credentials against the **Database**.
- Once logged in, the Manager requests the Employee Check-In Records. The EMS queries these records from the Database and displays them to the Manager.
- The Manager then requests an analysis of the working hours based on the check-in records. The EMS calculates total working hours and provides an analysis to the Manager.
- Finally, the Manager requests the generation of an Efficiency Report. The EMS compiles efficiency metrics, saves the report to the Database, and displays it to the Manager.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the Manager, the Employee Management System, and the underlying Database specifically for managing and analyzing employee check-in information and working hours within the context of the Restaurant Management and Operations System project.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a given user story involves illustrating the interactions between objects in a particular scenario. For the specified user story -- integrating a jQuery plugin for Core Data Packages to enable autocompletion using a core dataset -- the sequence diagram in PlantUML format can be outlined as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "jQuery Plugin" as Plugin
participant "Core Data Package" as CorePackage
participant "Form Control" as FormControl

Developer -> Plugin: Include Plugin in Project
activate Plugin

Plugin -> CorePackage: Request Dataset
activate CorePackage

CorePackage -> CorePackage: Fetch Dataset 
CorePackage --> Plugin: Return Dataset

deactivate CorePackage

Plugin -> FormControl: Apply Autocompletion
activate FormControl

FormControl -> FormControl: Display Autocompleted Results
FormControl --> Developer: Show Autocompletion in UI

deactivate FormControl
deactivate Plugin

@enduml
```

This PlantUML diagram starts with the Developer deciding to include the jQuery plugin in their project. The sequence progresses with the plugin requesting the relevant dataset from a Core Data Package. Once the core dataset has been fetched, it is returned to the plugin, which then applies the logic for autocompletion on a specified form control. The form control displays the autocompleted results based on the core dataset, ultimately reflecting the changes in the user interface visible to the Developer.

This diagram is a basic representation and can be expanded based on more detailed requirements, including error handling, interaction with external data sources, dynamic updating of datasets, and more complex UI interactions.

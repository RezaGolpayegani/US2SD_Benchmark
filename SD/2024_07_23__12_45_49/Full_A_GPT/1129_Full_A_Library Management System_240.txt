To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As a member, I want to assign a unique identification number to the books," we need to clarify the operational feasibility within the given context. Normally, the responsibility of assigning unique identification numbers to books lies with librarians or staff rather than library members. However, for the purposes of this exercise and to adhere to the request, we will creatively adjust the user story to fit a plausible scenario in the system's design. We can consider a feature where members can suggest or apply for a book to be added to the library's catalog, and as part of this process, a temporary unique identification is generated until finalized by a librarian.

Given this adjustment, letâ€™s craft a sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
entity "Web Interface" as web
control "Library System" as system
database "Database" as db
entity "Notification Service" as notifier

== Book Suggestion and Temporary ID Assignment Process ==

member -> web: Select "Suggest a Book"
web -> system: Initiate book suggestion
system -> db: Check if book already exists

alt Book exists
    db -> system: Book exists message
    system -> web: Show "Book Already Exists"
    web -> member: Display message
else Book does not exist
    db -> system: OK to proceed
    system -> db: Generate temporary unique ID
    db -> system: Temporary unique ID generated
    system -> web: Display temporary unique ID
    web -> member: Show ID and confirmation
    member -> web: Submits full book details
    web -> system: Capture book details and temporary ID
    system -> db: Store book suggestion and ID
    db -> system: Confirmation of storage
    system -> notifier: Send notification to librarian
    notifier -> system: Notification sent confirmation
    system -> web: Acknowledge receipt to member
    web -> member: Display acknowledgment message
end

This sequence diagram outlines the adjusted process where a member initiates a book suggestion through the web interface, leading to the generation of a temporary unique identification number for the book. The process includes checks to ensure no duplicate entries are created and involves notifying the librarian about the new suggestion for further actions, such as reviewing and formally assigning a permanent unique identification number to the new book entry in the library's catalog.

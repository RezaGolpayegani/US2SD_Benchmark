To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to delete items in inventory list" using PlantUML notation, the process involves several actors including the manager, the Restaurant Management and Operations System's interface, and the database system. Here is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format illustrating the interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as Interface
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Interface : selects "Inventory Management"
Interface -> Backend : request inventory list
Backend -> DB : query inventory items
DB -> Backend : return inventory items
Backend -> Interface : display inventory items
Manager -> Interface : selects item to delete
Interface -> Backend : request delete item
Backend -> DB : delete item query
DB -> Backend : confirm item deletion
Backend -> Interface : display deletion success message
Interface -> Manager : show updated inventory list

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps involved when a manager decides to delete an item from the inventory list:

1. **Manager selects "Inventory Management"**: This represents the action where the manager navigates to the section of the system where inventory items can be managed.
2. **Request and Display Inventory List**: The system fetches and displays the list of current inventory items from the database for the manager.
3. **Selection of Item to Delete**: The manager selects an item from the list that they wish to delete.
4. **Deletion Request and Database Update**: The system processes the deletion request by sending a query to the database to delete the specified item.
5. **Confirmation and Updated List**: Finally, the manager is shown a success message, and the updated list of inventory items is displayed, reflecting the deletion.

This diagram shows a simplified view of the process. Depending on requirements and existing system architecture, additional steps such as authentication and authorization checks, logging of the deletion action, and error handling procedures might also be included in the actual implementation.

To create a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story you provided, we'll first outline the steps necessary for an API user to change the colors of the embedded visualizations in their own platform, and then translate these steps into Plant UML syntax. This will involve interactions between the API User, the OpenSpending API, and the Visualization Customization Service.

### Detailed Steps:
1. The API User sends a request to the OpenSpending API to fetch the default visualization settings.
2. The OpenSpending API processes the request and returns the default visualization settings.
3. The API User decides on new color settings for the visualization.
4. The API User sends a customization request with the new color settings to the Visualization Customization Service via the OpenSpending API.
5. The Visualization Customization Service processes the new settings and updates the visualization customization options.
6. The Visualization Customization Service confirms the update and notifies the OpenSpending API.
7. The OpenSpending API sends the confirmation and the updated visualization settings back to the API User.
8. The API User integrates the customized visualization with updated colors into their platform.

### Plant UML Code:
The following Plant UML code translates the above steps into a sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "API User" as User
participant "OpenSpending API" as API
participant "Visualization Customization \nService" as VCSService

User -> API : Request default visualization settings
activate API
API -> VCSService : Fetch default settings
activate VCSService
VCSService -> API : Default settings
deactivate VCSService
API -> User : Default visualization settings
deactivate API

User -> User : Decide on new color settings

User -> API : Send customization request\nwith new color settings
activate API
API -> VCSService : Process new color settings
activate VCSService
VCSService -> VCSService : Update visualization customization
VCSService -> API : Confirm update &\nupdated settings
deactivate VCSService
API -> User : Confirmation &\nupdated visualization settings
deactivate API

User -> User : Integrate customized visualization\ninto platform

This diagram outlines the high-level interactions required for an API user to customize the colors of embedded visualizations within their platform via the OpenSpending platform's API and Visualization Customization Service. Note that for simplicity, error handling and authentication steps are not included in this sequence diagram.

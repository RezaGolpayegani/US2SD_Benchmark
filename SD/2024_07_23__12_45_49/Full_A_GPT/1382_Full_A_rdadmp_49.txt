Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the provided user story in PlantUML can be quite intricate since it involves multiple entities and actions. Here's a text representation of a PlantUML sequence diagram to capture the process of a funder checking all the repositories mentioned in a DMP (Data Management Plan) to verify compliance with funding rules.

Note: Given the complexity and potential variability in how DMPTool might be implemented or interacted with by various stakeholders, the sequence diagram description below is somewhat generalized and focuses on capturing the main steps and interactions as described in your project brief.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Funder
participant DMPTool
database Repositories
participant DMP
participant ComplianceService

== Funder Starts Compliance Check ==

Funder -> DMPTool : Request repositories from DMP
activate DMPTool

DMPTool -> DMP : Fetch Repository Details
activate DMP
DMP --> DMPTool : Repository List
deactivate DMP

DMPTool -> Funder : Show Repository List
Funder -> DMPTool : Select repositories for verification
activate Repositories

DMPTool -> Repositories : Query repositories data
Repositories --> DMPTool : Repositories Data
deactivate Repositories

DMPTool -> ComplianceService : Verify compliance with funding rules
activate ComplianceService
ComplianceService -> Repositories : Check data against funding rules
Repositories --> Compliance2005Service : Validation Response
Deactivate ComplianceService

ComplianceService --> DMPTool : Compliance Report
DMPTool --> Funder : Show Compliance Report

== End of Process ==

This sequence diagram starts with the `Funder` making a request to the `DMPTool` to fetch the repository details mentioned in a specific DMP. The `DMPTool` then retrieves the repository details from the `DMP` (which could be a part of the DMPTool or an external system, depending on the actual implementation). Once the repository list is provided to the `Funder`, they can select repositories for verification. The `DMPTool` queries these repository details against a `Repositories` database/system to gather the relevant data. 

Next, the `DMPTool` sends this data to a `ComplianceService`, which checks if the repository data complies with the funder's rules by querying the `Repositories` again or performing other logic as required. Finally, the `ComplianceService` sends a compliance report back to the `DMPTool`, which then presents this report to the `Funder`.

This diagram assumes a simplified interaction flow and does not cover all possible error handling or secondary processes for brevity. Depending on the project's exact requirements, additional details and interactions could be necessary.

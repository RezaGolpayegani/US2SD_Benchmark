To create a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format based on the given user story, we need to define the interactions between the Consumer and the Data Registry and Publishing Platform's components involved in the process of downloading a data package at a particular version. 

Here's a basic example of how this could be visualized in PlantUML. This example assumes the Consumer already knows which dataset and version they're interested in and that authentication has been handled if necessary.

```
@startuml
participant "Consumer" as consumer
participant "UI/CLI" as ui
database "Platform Server" as server
database "Data Storage" as storage

== Download Data Package at Specific Version ==
consumer -> ui : Request specific version of data package
ui -> server : Validate request & fetch version details
alt Data package version exists
    server -> storage : Retrieve specified version of data package
    storage -> server : Specified version data
    server -> ui : Provide download link for data package
    ui -> consumer : Offer data package download
    consumer -> ui : Download package
    ui -> storage : Download requested data
    storage -> consumer : Data package (version specific)
else Version not found
    server -> ui : Error message (version not found)
    ui -> consumer : Show error message
end

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Consumer requesting a specific version of a data packages from the UI or CLI. The platform server validates this request and fetches the details for the requested version. If the specified version exists, the server retrieves it from data storage and provides a download link to the Consumer through the UI or CLI. The Consumer then initiates the download and receives the data package directly from data storage. If the requested version doesn't exist, an error message is generated and passed back to the Consumer.

Please note, this is a simplified example. Depending on the complexities and additional features of your platform, like authentication, version control, and data integrity checks, you might need to add more components or interactions to fully represent the sequence of actions in your particular system.

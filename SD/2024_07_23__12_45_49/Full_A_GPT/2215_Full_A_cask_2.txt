Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format will involve illustrating the interactions between app developers, dataset types, dataset instances, and the management system as the developer deploys a new app version which includes an updated dataset type. Below is a simplified version of how such an interaction might occur, focusing on key actions like deploying the app, including the dataset type, updating existing instances, and ensuring dataset instances use the new dataset type version.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AppDeveloper as "App Developer"
participant DeploymentSystem as "Deployment System"
participant DatasetManagement as "Dataset Management"
participant DatasetType as "Dataset Type"
participant DatasetInstances as "Dataset Instances"

AppDeveloper -> DeploymentSystem : deploy new app version with updated dataset type
DeploymentSystem -> DatasetManagement : check for updated dataset type
DatasetManagement -> DatasetType : deploy new version
DatasetType -> DatasetManagement : version deployed successfully
DatasetManagement -> DatasetInstances : update instances to new dataset type version
DatasetInstances -> DatasetManagement : instances updated successfully
DatasetManagement -> DeploymentSoft : confirm app and dataset deployment success
DeploymentSystem --> AppDeveloper : deployment success confirmation

This diagram simplifies the process to focus on the main elements described in the user story. Here's a walkthrough of the steps represented:

1. **App Developer Initiates Deployment**: The App Developer deploys a new version of the app, which includes an updated dataset type version.

2. **Deployment System Checks for Updates**: The Deployment System, upon receiving the instruction to deploy the new app version, contacts the Dataset Management system to check and deploy the updated dataset type.

3. **Dataset Type Version Deployment**: The Dataset Management system deploys the new version of the dataset type and confirms successful deployment.

4. **Updating Dataset Instances**: The Dataset Management system then updates existing dataset instances to use the new version of the dataset type, ensuring that they start using the new code bundled with the app.

5. **Confirmation of Successful Deployment**: The Dataset Management system reports back to the Deployment System, which then confirms to the App Developer that the deployment, including the app and its associated dataset type (and instances), was successful.

Keep in mind that this sequence diagram is a high-level view and the actual implementation details might require more in-depth sequences to handle error cases, version compatibility checks, rollback mechanisms, and notifications to stakeholders among other aspects relevant to robust dataset management and version control in application ecosystems.

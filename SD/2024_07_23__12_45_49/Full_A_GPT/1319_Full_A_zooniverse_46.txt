Below is a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: As a Zooniverse admin, I want to remove background noise and distracting sounds from the audio files.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ZooniverseAdmin as admin
participant "Media Upload Interface" as upload
participant "Audio Processing Module" as audioProc
participant "Noise Reduction Algorithm" as noiseRed
database "Audio Storage" as storage

admin -> upload : Upload audio file
activate upload
upload -> audioProc : Send audio file
activate audioProc

audioProc -> noiseRed : Analyze and identify noise
activate noiseRed
noiseRed --> audioProc : Noise profile
deactivate noiseRed

audioProc -> noiseMitigation Filter -> noiseRed : Apply noise reduction
activate noiseFilter
noiseFilter -> storage : Save processed audio
activate storage
storage --> admin : Updated audio file available
deactivate storage
deactivate noiseFilter
deactivate audioProc
deactivate upload

In this diagram, the sequence begins with the Zooniverse admin uploading an audio file through the Media Upload Interface. The uploaded audio file is then sent to the Audio Processing Module, which analyzes and identifies the background noise and distracting sounds using the Noise Reduction Algorithm. After identifying the noise, the Audio Processing Module applies a noise reduction filter to mitigate the identified noise, and the processed audio is then saved back to the Audio Storage. Finally, the updated audio file is made available to the Zooniverse admin, completing the process of removing background noise and distracting sounds from the audio files.

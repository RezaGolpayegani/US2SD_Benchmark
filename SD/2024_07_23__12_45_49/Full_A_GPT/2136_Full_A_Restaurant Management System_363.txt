Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to see prices of the ordered foods by customers" involves outlining the interaction between different system components in response to the employee's request. Below is an illustrative sequence diagram described in PlantUML format. Note that this assumes a simplified flow, focusing on the primary interactions necessary for an employee to view the prices of ordered foods.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant UI as "User Interface"
participant Server as "Backend Server"
participant DB as "Database"

Employee -> UI : Select "View Orders"
UI -> Server : Request orders list
Server -> DB : Query orders and prices
DB -> Server : Return orders and prices
Server -> UI : Display orders with prices
UI -> Employee : Show orders and prices

@endump
```

This sequence starts with the employee selecting the option to view orders in the user interface (UI), which could be a web page or a mobile app. The UI then requests this information from the backend server, which queries the database for the necessary data (orders placed by customers along with their prices). The database returns this information to the server, which in turn sends it back to the UI to be displayed to the employee.

Please make sure you have PlantUML installed and configured in your environment to render this sequence diagram correctly. If you're using an online editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) with PlantUML support, you should be able to paste this code directly and see the diagram.

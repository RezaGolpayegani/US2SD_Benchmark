Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story involves outlining the interactions between the user and the system components when searching for profiles based on specific fields. Here is an example of how you might represent this process in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Site Member" as member
participant "Search Interface" as search
participant "Profile Database" as db
participant "Search Controller" as controller
participant "Results Page" as results

member -> search : Enter search criteria
search -> controller : Pass search criteria
controller -> db : Query profiles based on criteria
db -> controller : Return matching profiles
controller -> results : Display matching profiles
results -> member : Show search results

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
- **Site Member**: The actor or the user who wishes to search for profiles based on specific fields.
- **Search Interface**: The front-end component where the user inputs their search criteria.
- **Search Controller**: The back-end controller that handles the search logic.
- **Profile Database**: The storage that holds all the profile information.
- **Results Page**: The interface component that displays the search results to the user.

### Process Flow:
1. **Enter search criteria**: The user begins by entering search criteria into the Search Interface.
2. **Pass search criteria**: The search criteria are then passed to the Search Controller.
3. **Query profiles based on criteria**: The Search Controller queries the Profile Database for profiles that match the specified criteria.
4. **Return matching profiles**: The Profile Database returns a list of profiles that match the search criteria.
5. **Display matching profiles**: The Search Controller processes the matching profiles and prepares them for display.
6. **Show search results**: Finally, the Results Page shows the search results to the user.

Creating a sequence diagram for the described user story, "As a moderator, I want to estimate a story we estimated earlier in the session again, so that we can give a new estimate if we feel different about the detail after estimating other related stories," involves outlining the interactions between different entities such as the moderator, the web interface of the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT), and the backend system. Here's how these interactions can be visualized using PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Moderator
participant "AEPT Web Interface" as WebInterface
participant "Estimation Session Management" as SessionManagement
participant Database

Moderator -> WebInterface: Access session dashboard
WebInterface -> SessionManagement: Request list of estimated stories
SessionManagement -> Database: Query estimated stories
Database -> SessionManagement: Return estimated stories
SessionManagement -> WebInterface: Display estimated stories
WebInterface -> Moderator: Show estimated stories list

Moderator -> WebInterface: Select story to re-estimate
WebInterface -> SessionManagement: Request story details for re-estimation
SessionManagement -> Database: Query selected story details
Database -> SessionManagement: Return story details
SessionManagement -> WebInterface: Display story details in estimation mode

Moderator -> WebInterface: Input new estimate
WebInterface -> SessionManagement: Submit new estimate
SessionManagement -> Database: Update story with new estimate
Database -> SessionManagement: Confirm update
SessionManagement -> WebInterface: Update confirmation
Web3Interface -> Moderator: Display updated story with new estimate

### Explanation
1. **Moderator Accesses Session Dashboard:** The moderator accesses the dashboard of an ongoing estimation session via the AEPT Web Interface.
2. **Request and Display Estimated Stories:** The moderator requests to see a list of already estimated stories. This interaction involves fetching this information from the database through the session management system.
3. **Selecting a Story for Re-estimation:** Upon reviewing the list, the moderator selects a specific story they wish to re-estimate.
4. **Entering New Estimate:** The AEPT Web Interface provides a mechanism for the moderator to input a new estimate for the selected story.
5. **Submission and Database Update:** The new estimate is submitted to the backend, where it is processed and saved, updating the existing record of the story with the new estimate.
6. **Confirmation and Display Update:** The moderator is shown a confirmation of the updated estimate, and the interface is updated to reflect the change.

This sequence diagram reflects a simplified interaction flow focusing on the back-and-forth communication necessary for a moderator to re-estimate a story in the AEPT. It assumes a straightforward web application architecture comprising a frontend web interface, a backend session management system, and a persistent storage database.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves understanding the processes a researcher would undergo to inquire about a specific file within a digital archive management system. Below is a sequence diagram that outlines the series of interactions between the researcher, the system, and other components to achieve the stated goal.

Please note, the sequence diagram code assumes a basic scenario where the researcher uses a web interface to send a query, which is processed by the backend system, potentially requiring interaction with a database, and finally, a response is generated and sent back to the user.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Researcher as researcher
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Archive Database" as db
participant "Notification System" as notification
entity "Archivist" as archivist

== Ask a Question About a Specific File ==

researcher -> web : Access file details
web -> backend : Request file information
backend -> db : Query file details
db -> backend : Return file information
backend -> web : Display file info to researcher
researcher -> web : Click on "Ask a Question"
web -> backend : Show question form
researcher -> web : Submit question form
web -> backend : Process question
backend -> db : Log question with file reference
db -> backend : Confirm log entry
backend -> notification : Send notification to Archivist
notification -> archivist : Notify about new question
archivist -> notification : View question details
notification -> backend : Request detailed information
backend -> db : Fetch file and question details
db -> backend : Return requested information
backend -> notification : Send detailed info to Archivist
archivist -> backend : Submit response
backend -> notification : Process response
notification -> researcher : Notify researcher with answer
researcher -> web : View response

This diagram starts with the researcher accessing the web interface, moves through finding and asking about a specific file, and ends with receiving an answer from an archivist. Key processes like file information display, question form submission, notification to the archivist, and finally, the researcher viewing the response, are depicted.

To use this code, you'd need a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor where you can paste this code to generate the sequence diagram. The diagram visually represents the interactions over time, providing a clear understanding of the steps involved in a researcher asking a question about a specific file in a digital archive.

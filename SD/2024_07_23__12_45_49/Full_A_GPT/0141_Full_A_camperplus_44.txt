Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the scenario where a parent wants to share photos the camp has taken of their child involves describing the interactions between the parent user, the system (Camp Management & Communication Platform), potentially a photo storage/service, and any other relevant actors like authentication services or perhaps a third-party sharing service (assuming such capabilities are part of or integrated with the platform).

Considering the basic functionalities and emphasizing simplicity, the following PlantUML code outlines one possible implementation of this user story. Note that this diagram assumes the platform includes direct photo sharing functionality and that the photos are accessible through a secure authentication process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Parent as parent
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Camp Management \n& Communication Platform" as CMCP
participant "Photo Storage" as PhotoStore
participant "Sharing Service" as ShareService

parent -> CMCP : Access platform
activate CMCP

CMCP -> Auth : Validate parent credentials
activate Auth
Auth --> CMCP : Authentication Success
deactivate Auth

CMCP --> parent : Show dashboard
parent -> CMCP : Select "View Photos"
activate PhotoStore

CMCP -> PhotoStore : Request photos of parent's child
PhotoStore --> CMCP : Return photos
deactivate PhotoStore

CMCP --> parent : Display child's photos
parent -> CMCP : Select photos to share
parent -> CMCP : Select "Share Photos"
activate ShareService

CMCP -> ShareService : Invoke sharing service with selected photos
ShareService --> CMCP : Generate share link
deactivate ShareService

CMCP --> parent : Provide share link
parent -> CMCP : Copy & share link externally

deactivate CMCP

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Parent Accesses Platform:** The parent logs onto the Camp Management & Communication Platform (CMCP).
2.  **Authentication:** The system interacts with the Authentication Service to validate the parent's credentials.
3.  **View Photos:** Once authenticated and on the dashboard, the parent can navigate to view photos of their child taken at the camp, which prompts the CMCP to request photos from Photo Storage.
4.  **Select & Share Photos:** The parent selects specific photos they wish to share and initiates the sharing process. The CMCP uses an integrated Sharing Service to facilitate this, generating a link for the parent.
5.  **External Sharing:** The parent receives a shareable link, which they can then distribute outside the platform via their preferred communication method (e.g., social media, email).

This diagram simplifies multiple steps and assumes integration with both photo storage and a sharing service, focusing on the sequence of actions from the parent's perspective and the system's reactions. Depending on real-world complexities, additional steps like error handling, more detailed authentication processes, and interactions with external services could further expand it.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story you've stated involves understanding the interaction between different actors and systems in the process of managing worm strain stocks integrated with Wormbase. Let's draft a basic PlantUML code skeleton for this. The sequence will involve the lab administrator initiating a request to manage worm strain stocks, which gets processed through the enhanced Neurohub platform, and then interacts with Wormbase for data retrieval or update.

Please note, to render this PlantUML code, you would need to use a PlantUML environment (like an online editor, IDE plugin, or a local setup).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Lab Administrator" as admin
participant "Neurohub Interface" as neurohub
database "Wormbase" as wormbase

== Managing Worm Strain Stocks ==
admin -> neurohub : Request worm strain management
activate neurohub

neurohub -> wormbase : Retrieve current strain data
activate wormbase
wormbaee --> neurohub : Strain data
deactivate wormbase

admin <- neurohub : Display strain data
activate admin
admin -> admin : Review / Update data

admin -> neurohub : Submit updated strain data
deactivate admin

neurohub -> wormbase : Update strain information
activate wormbase
wormbase --> neurohub : Confirmation of update
deactivate wormbase

neurohub --> admin : Confirmation message
activate admin
deactivate admin
deactivate neurohub

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Lab Administrator Request:** The lab administrator initiates a request for managing worm strain stocks via the Neurohub interface. This could involve querying current stock information, updating it, or adding new stock details.

2. **Neurohub Processes Request:** The Neurohub interface processes this request. First, it might need to fetch the current worm strain data from Wormbase if the task is to review or update existing records.

3. **Interaction with Wormbase:** Neurohub queries Wormbase for the required data, which, upon retrieval, is sent back to the Neurohub interface.

4. **Display and Review:** The lab administrator reviews the fetched data or enters new information into the Neurohub interface. This could include editing details about the worm strains or adding new stock details.

5. **Update Submission:** Once the administrator finalizes the changes or new entries, these are submitted back through the Neurohub interface.

6. **Wormbase Update:** Neurohub sends the updated or new strain information to Wormbase to either create new records or update existing ones. 

7. **Confirmation:** Once Wormbase successfully updates its records, a confirmation is sent back to the Neurohub interface, which then informs the lab administrator of the successful update or creation.

This sequence diagram is a simplified representation. Real-world applications might involve more detailed interactions, error handling, authentication and authorization processes, and user feedback mechanisms. Depending on the project requirements and scope, more actors (like system administrators for managing user permissions) or systems (like backups for data integrity) might be involved.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML requires specifying the interactions between different entities in the minting process. This includes the interaction between the depositor, the research data management platform, and any external systems such as a DOI registration agency (for example, Crossref or DataCite).

Please note, the following is a simplified version focusing on the key steps involved when a depositor wants to mint DOIs for their data. Depending on the actual architecture of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform and the external DOI service provider, there could be additional steps or complexities not captured here.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Depositor
boundary "Research Data Management Platform" as Platform
control "DOI Service Provider" as DOIService

Depositor -> Platform : Submit data with metadata
activate Platform

Platform -> Platform : Validate metadata
Platform -> Platform : Assign internal ID
Platform -> DOIService : Request DOI
activate DOIService

DOIService -> DOIService : Generate DOI
DOIService --> Platform : Return DOI
deactivate DOIService

Platform -> Platform : Update dataset with DOI
Platform -> Platform : Store dataset and metadata
Platform --> Depositor : Confirm DOI and provide link

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Submit data with metadata:** The depositor starts the process by submitting their data along with the necessary metadata to the platform.
2. **Validate metadata:** The platform validates the provided metadata to ensure it meets the required standards for DOI minting.
3. **Assign internal ID:** The platform assigns an internal ID to the dataset, which is used for internal tracking purposes.
4. **Request DOI:** The platform sends a request to the DOI Service Provider to generate a DOI for the dataset.
5. **Generate DOI:** The DOI Service Provider generates a unique DOI for the dataset.
6. **Return DOI:** The DOI Service Provider returns the generated DOI to the platform.
7. **Update dataset with DOI:** The platform updates the dataset record with the newly minted DOI and finalizes the dataset's metadata.
8. **Store dataset and metadata:** The platform stores the dataset along with its metadata, including the DOI, making it accessible for search, discovery, and citation.
9. **Confirm DOI and provide link:** Finally, the platform confirms to the depositor that the DOI has been successfully minted and provides a link to the dataset with the DOI.

Remember, the actual implementation details might vary based on the platform's architecture, the specific DOI service used, and additional requirements such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

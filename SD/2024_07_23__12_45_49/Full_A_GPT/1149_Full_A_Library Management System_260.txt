Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story in Plant UML format involves illustrating how different system components interact with each other when a library member searches for books by an author. Below is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML code focusing on this functionality:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member
participant UISystem
participant SearchController
participant Database
participant Book

== Lookup Books by Author ==

Member -> UISystem : Enters search query (Author name)
UISystem -> SearchController : Initiate author search
activate SearchController

SearchController -> Database : Query books by author
activate Database

Database -> Book : Fetch books matching author
activate Book

Book -> Database : Return results
deactivate Book

Database -> SearchController : Send results
deactivate Database

SearchController -> UISystem : Display search results
deactivate SearchController

UISystem -> Member : Show list of books by author
@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Member Interaction**: The sequence starts with the Member (library user) entering a search query for a book by an author's name in the User Interface System (UISystem).

2. **UISystem to SearchController**: The UISystem forwards the search request to a backend controller, here named `SearchController`, responsible for handling book search operations.

3. **Search in Database**: `SearchController` then formulates a query to retrieve books from the `Database` that match the specified author's name.

4. **Book Object Response**: The `Database` processes the query, fetches the relevant `Book` instances that match the criteria, and sends a list of these books back to the `SearchController`.

5. **Returning the Results**: The `SearchController` receives the search results and sends them back to the UISystem, which in turn displays the list of books written by the specified author to the Member.

6. **Display Results to Member**: Finally, the Member views the results which could include details like book title, author, publication year, and availability status.

This sequence diagram is a simplified representation focusing primarily on the search functionality. Actual implementations might involve additional steps or components such security checks, data caching, or user preference analysis for optimized results.

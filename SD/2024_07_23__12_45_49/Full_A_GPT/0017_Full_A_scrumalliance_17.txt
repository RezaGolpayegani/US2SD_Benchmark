Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format requires breaking down the user story into its component interactions. The user story, "As a site visitor, I want to email news items to the editor, so that they can be considered for publication," involves multiple steps and actors, including the site visitor, the web interface of the community platform, potentially a backend server, and the editorial team or editor who would receive the news submission.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that represents this user story. Please note that since this is a text-based description, you will need PlantUML software or an online PlantUML tool to visualize the sequence diagram generated by the following code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteVisitor as visitor
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Email System" as email
participant "Editor" as editor

visitor -> web: Accesses News Submission Page
web -> visitor: Displays News Submission Form
visitor -> web: Submits News Item (Email, Content)
web -> server: Validates Submission
alt validation successful
    server --> web: Confirmation
    web -> visitor: Displays Submission Success Message
    server -> email: Composes Email (News Item)
    email -> editor: Sends Email to Editor
else validation fails
    server --> web: Error Message
    web -> visitor: Displays Error Message (e.g., Invalid Email)
end
@enduml
```

This diagram breaks down the process as follows:

1. The **Site Visitor** accesses the news submission page on the **Web Interface**.
2. The **Web Interface** displays the news submission form to the **Site Visitor**.
3. The **Site Visitor** fills out and submits the news item, including their email and the content of the news.
4. The **Web Interface** sends this information to the **Backend Server** for validation.
5. If the submission is successfully validated:
   - The **Backend Server** sends a confirmation back to the **Web Interface**, which then displays a submission success message to the **Site Visitor**.
   - The **Backend Server** instructs the **Email System** to compose an email containing the submitted news item.
   - The **Email System** sends this email to the **Editor** for consideration.
6. If the submission fails validation:
   - The **Backend Server** sends an error message back to the **Web Interface**.
   - The **Web Interface** displays an error message to the **Site Visitor**.

This sequence diagram provides a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in the user story and how each actor and component interacts from the point of submission to the point where the news item is emailed to the editor for consideration.

To illustrate the process detailed in the user story as a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, consider the following steps: User authentication, data package submission, validation, storage on the publisher’s server, caching by the registry, and finally publication confirmation. Here's how these steps can be translated into a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Publisher as pub
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "Data Publishing Interface" as dpi
participant "Validation Service" as validate
participant "Publisher's Server" as server
participant "Registry Cache" as cache
participant "Publication Confirmation" as confirm

pub -> auth: Authenticate\n(GitHub, Google)
auth --> pub: Authentication Success

pub -> dpi: Submit Data Package
dpi -> validate: Validate Data Package
validate --> dpi: Validation Success

dpi -> server: Store Data on Publisher's Server
server --> dpi: Data Stored Successfully

dpi -> cache: Cache Copy of Data Package
cache --> dpi: Caching Successful

dpi -> confirm: Publish Data Package
confirm --> pub: Publication Success Notification

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Authentication**: The Publisher logs in through an authentication service, which could be via GitHub or Google integration, ensuring the user is authenticated before any data package submission.

2. **Submit Data Package**: Once authenticated, the Publisher submits the data package to the Data Publishing Interface (DPI).

3. **Validation**: The DPI forwards the data package to a Validation Service to ensure its accuracy and integrity. On success, it moves to the next step.

4. **Storage on Publisher’s Server**: The DPI instructs to store the data on the Publisher's own server, ensuring that the original data source is controlled by the Publisher.

5. **Caching by the Registry**: Once the data is confirmed stored on the Publisher's server, the DPI requests the Registry Cache to store a copy of the data package. This ensures availability even if the original data gets lost or broken.

6. **Publication Confirmation**: Finally, the DPI confirms the successful publication of the data package to the Publisher, which includes the successful caching of the data by the registry.

This sequence diagram represents a high-level overview of the interactions and steps involved from the perspective of a Publisher intending to publish a data package with resources stored on their servers while ensuring the registry caches a copy.

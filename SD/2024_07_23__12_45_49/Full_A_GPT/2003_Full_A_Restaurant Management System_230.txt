Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As a restaurant employee, I want to get a notification when an order is canceled so that I can track the most quickly," can be complex due to the myriad interactions involved. Here, we need to consider the flow involving the customer (who may cancel the order), the system (which processes the cancellation and notification logic), and the restaurant employee (who receives the notification). This scenario assumes an interaction with a web-based restaurant management system.

Given the project description and focusing on a simplified version for clarity, here is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the basic interactions for the described user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer as C
participant "Order System" as OS
participant "Notification System" as NS
actor Employee as E

C -> OS: Cancel Order
OS -> NS : Process Cancellation
activate NS #FFBBBB
NS -> OS : Order Cancellation Reason
OS -> E : Send Notification
activate E #DarkSalmon
E -> OS : Acknowledge Notification
deactivate E
deactivate NS
@enduml
```

This diagram follows these steps:
1. The **Customer** initiates an order cancellation request to the **Order System**.
2. The **Order System** processes this request and communicates with the **Notification System** to handle the cancellation logic.
3. The **Notification System** may then request additional information, like the order cancellation reason, which is then processed internally.
4. Once the cancellation reason is processed, the **Notification System** instructs the **Order System** to send a notification to the relevant **Employee** about the cancellation.
5. The **Employee** receives the notification, and an acknowledgment is sent back to the **Order System** indicating that the notification was received and understood.

It's worth noting that this diagram is a high-level overview. In a real-world scenario, additional steps and actors (e.g., a Database Management System for logging the cancellation and reason, External Notification Services for sending notifications via SMS or email) might be involved, making the process more complex.

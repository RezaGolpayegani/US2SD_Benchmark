Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to delete the employee information" involves depicting the communication between different entities within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Here, I will generate a PlantUML script that represents this process.

To understand the sequence, here's a simplified flow of events that we will represent in the diagram:

1. The manager initiates the process by selecting the employee information to be deleted.
2. The system asks for confirmation to ensure that the manager wants to proceed with deletion.
3. Upon confirmation, the system performs the deletion operation in the database.
4. The system then confirms the deletion back to the manager.

Here is the corresponding PlantUML script to visualize this flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> WebUI: Select "Delete Employee"
WebUI -> Server: Request deletion of employee
Server -> DB: Check if employee exists

alt employee exists
    DB -> Server: Employee found
    Server -> WebUI: Ask for confirmation
    Manager -> WebUI: Confirm deletion
    WebUI -> Server: Delete command with confirmation
    Server -> DB: Delete employee record
    DB -> Server: Confirmation of deletion
    Server -> WebUI: Deletion successful
    WebUI -> Manager: Show deletion confirmation
else employee does not exist
    DB -> Server: Employee not found
    Server -> WebUI: Error: Employee does not exist
    WebUI -> Manager: Show error message
end

This script outlines a basic sequence of interactions without going into the intricacies of authentication and authorization, error handling for cases where the employee might be associated with unresolved tasks or financial records, and other complexities that might arise in a real-world scenario. 

To use this script, you'll need a PlantUML environment set up or access to an online PlantUML editor where you can paste this code to visualize the sequence diagram.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story mentioned in the project description requires specifying the interactions between various system components and actors involved in the process of disseminating works in a branded digital space. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines these interactions. Please note, for simplicity, external systems integration (like Symplectic Elements or Activity Insight) mentioned in the system integration section are not included here but assumed as part of the background processes.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "Branding Module" as branding
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "External User" as user

admin -> branding: Initiate upload process
activate branding
branding -> CMS: Upload content
activate CMS
CMS -> DB: Store metadata\n(Set branded metadata fields)
activate DB
DB --> CMS: Confirm storage
deactivate DB
CMS --> branding: Confirm upload and metadata application
deactivate CMS
branding --> admin: Display upload and branding success message
deactivate branding

admin -> UI: Publish branded content
activate UI
UI -> DB: Update content status to 'Published'
activate DB
DB --> UI: Confirm status update
deactivate DB
UI --> admin: Display publication success message
deactivate UI

loop Each External User Access
    user -> UI: Access branded content
    activate UI
    UI -> DB: Retrieve branded content
    activate DB
    DB --> UI: Return branded content
    deactivate DB
    UI --> user: Display branded content
    deactivate UI
end

The diagram starts with the administrator initiating the upload process through the branding module, which interfaces with the Content Management System (CMS) for the content upload. The CMS then stores the relevant metadata, including branded metadata fields, into the database (DB). Once the upload and metadata application are confirmed, the Administrator is notified of the success.

Next, the Administrator publishes the branded content via the User Interface (UI), which updates the content's status in the DB to 'Published'. After the publication success message, the diagram depicts a loop showing how each external user can access the branded content through the UI, which retrieves the content from the DB and displays it to the user.

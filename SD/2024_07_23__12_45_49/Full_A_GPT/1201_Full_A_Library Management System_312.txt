Certainly! Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines the process of a library member updating their online reservations for books within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This includes interactions between the user, the system interface, and the backend components necessary to facilitate the reservation update.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Reservation System" as reservationSystem
participant "Database" as db

== Update Online Reservation ==

member -> ui : Selects option to update reservation
ui -> reservation <u>reservations</u>

reservation -> db : Fetch current reservation details\n(MemberID, BookID)
db -> reservation : Current reservation details
reservation -> ui : Display current reservation details
ui -> member : Shows current reservation details

member -> ui : Inputs new reservation details\n(New dates, Book etc.)
ui -> reservation : Sends updated reservation info\n(MemberID, NewDetails)

alt If update is valid
    reservation -> db : Update reservation details in DB\n(MemberID, NewDetails)
    db -> reservation : Confirm reservation update
    reservation -> ui : Display update success message
    ui -> member : Shows reservation update success
else If update is invalid
    reservation -> ui : Display error message\n(Conflicting dates/Unavailable book)
    ui -> member : Show error (Conflict/Book Unavailable)
end

### Explanation:
- **Member**: The library member or user who wants to update their book reservation.
- **UI Interface**: Represents the frontend interface through which the member interacts with the CLMS.
- **Reservation System**: The part of the system that handles reservations including updating them based on member requests.
- **Database**: Where all data related to reservations, books, and members are stored and managed.

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Selects option to update reservation**: The member initiates the process by choosing to update an existing reservation through the system interface.
2. **Fetch current reservation details**: The Reservation System queries the Database to retrieve the current details of the member's reservation.
3. **Display current reservation details**: Current reservation details are shown to the member for confirmation or modification.
4. **Inputs new reservation details**: The member inputs new details for the reservation, such as new dates or a different book.
5. **Update reservation in DB**: The new reservation details are validated and updated in the Database if there's no conflict or issue.
6. **Confirmation or Error Handling**: The system either confirms the successful update of the reservation or displays an error if the update cannot be made due to conflicts or unavailability.

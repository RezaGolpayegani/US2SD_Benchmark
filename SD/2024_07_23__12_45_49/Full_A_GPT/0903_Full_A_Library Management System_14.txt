Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to update book recommendation" involves outlining various system components and their interactions. Below is the PlantUML code to visualize this process. The process assumes the customer is already logged in and wishes to update a recommendation they've previously made.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Recommendation Controller" as Controller
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
participant "Recommendation Service" as RecService
participant "Database" as DB

Customer -> UI : Selects "My Recommendations"
UI -> Controller : Request to view recommendations
Controller -> AuthService : Validate user session
AuthService -> Controller : Session valid
Controller -> RecService : Fetch user recommendations
RecService -> DB : Query recommendations by user ID
DB -> RecService : Return recommendations
RecService -> Controller : Recommendations data
Controller -> UI : Display recommendations
UI -> Customer : Shows list of recommendations

Customer -> UI : Choose recommendation to update
UI -> Controller : Request update to recommendation [ID]
Controller -> AuthService : Confirm user permissions
AuthService -> Controller : Permission granted
Controller -> RecService : Request update [ID, new details]
RecService -> DB : Update recommendation entry
DB -> RecService : Confirmation of update
RecService -> Controller : Update successful
Controller -> UI : Update confirmation
UI -> Customer : Display update success message

```

This sequence diagram starts with the Customer interacting with the UI Interface to view their recommendations. Upon selecting a specific recommendation to update, the UI Interface communicates with the Recommendation Controller, which then checks with the Authentication Service to ensure the session and user permissions are valid. Once permissions are confirmed, the Recommendation Controller instructs the Recommendation Service to update the specific recommendation based on the customer's inputs. The Recommendation Service interacts with the Database to perform the update and returns a confirmation to the Customer through the UI Interface to indicate the process is completed successfully.

Remember, this diagram assumes a basic flow and could be expanded with error handling, more detailed interaction (e.g., specific fields being updated in the recommendation), or integration with other system components depending on the project requirements.

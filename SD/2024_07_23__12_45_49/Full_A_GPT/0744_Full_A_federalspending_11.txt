Given the project description and your request, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram snippet for the user story: "As a UI designer, I want to move on to round 2 of Homepage edits, so that I can get approvals from leadership." This sequence diagram aims to represent the workflow involved specifically in the context of a UI designer preparing and seeking approval for the second round of homepage design edits.

### Explanation

1. **Round 1 Edits Review**: This part demonstrates the process where the UI Designer submits the initial homepage draft to the design team, which is then uploaded to a review system for leadership to review and provide feedback or approval.
   
2. **Prepare for Round 2 Edits**: After receiving feedback from the leadership through the review system, the UI Designer analyzes the feedback to prepare for the second round of edits.

3. **Round 2 Edits Submission**: The UI Designer submits the second round of edits to the design team, which again uploads these edits to the review system. The review system notifies the leadership for a second round of review.

4. **Round 2 Review**: In this final step, the leadership provides feedback or approval for the second set of edits. The review system communicates this back to the UI Designer, who then makes necessary adjustments based on the feedback or finalizes the design if approved.

This sequence diagram focuses on the interaction between the UI Designer, the design team, the review system, and the leadership concerning progressing through and completing the second round of homepage edits.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the mentioned user story in PlantUML format involves various steps and components interacting with each other. Below is a simplified PlantUML code that represents the sequence diagram for the admin task of adding recycling center information to maintain an updated database. This diagram assumes a basic interaction flow based on the provided project description.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Admin
participant "Admin Interface" as UI
participant "Server" as Server
database "Database" as DB

== Add Recycling Center Information ==

Admin -> UI : Access Update Center Form
UI -> Admin : Display Form

Admin -> UI : Input Recycling Center Data
UI -> Server : Submit New Center Info

Server -> DB : Validate and Add Info
DB --> Server : Confirmation

Server -> UI : Display Success Message
UI -> Admin : Show Confirmation

== End ==

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram focuses on the specific action of an administrative user (admin) adding or updating a recycling center's information in the system. Here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. **Access Update Center Form**: The admin accesses the form to update or add new recycling center information through the administrative interface.
2. **Display Form**: The Admin Interface displays the form to the admin.
3. **Input Recycling Tour Data**: The admin inputs all required and relevant information about the recycling center, such as its name, address, types of recyclable materials accepted, operating hours, etc.
4. **Submit New Center Info**: Once all information is filled in, the admin submits it through the Admin Interface, which in turn sends it to the server.
5. **Validate and Add Info**: The server validates the provided information for completeness and correctness. If everything is valid, it proceeds to add or update the recycling center's information in the database.
6. **Confirmation**: The database confirms the successful addition or update of the information back to the server.
7. **Display Success Message**: Finally, the server instructs the Admin Interface to display a success message to the admin, confirming that the recycling center's information has been updated successfully.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and can be detailed further based on specific requirements, such as security checks, error handling, and more complex interaction details between the server and the database.

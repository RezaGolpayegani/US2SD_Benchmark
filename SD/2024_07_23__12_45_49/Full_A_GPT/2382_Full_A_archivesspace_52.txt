Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story "As an Archivist, I want to create and edit a Resource record" requires capturing the interaction between the system components involved in creating and editing a record in the Comprehensive Archival Management System (CAMS). Below is a PlantUML code that illustrates these interactions. Keep in makeup that this diagram is a simplification and might need adjustments based on the specific implementations and system architectures you're working with.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Resource Management Module" as RMM
database "CAMS Database" as DB

== Creating a Resource Record ==
Archivist -> UI : Selects "Create New Resource"
UI -> Auth : Validate Archivist Credentials
Auth -> UI : Credentials Valid
UI -> RMM : Request to Create a New Resource Record
RMM -> DB : Create New Resource Record Entry
DB --> RMM : Confirm Creation
RMM --> UI : Display New Resource Record Form
UI --> Archivist : New Resource Record Form

== Editing a Resource Record ==
Archivist -> UI : Access and Edit Resource Record
UI -> Auth : Validate Archivist Credentials
Auth -> UI : Credentials Valid
UI -> RMM : Request to Access Resource Record
RMM -> DB : Retrieve Resource Record Data
DB --> RMM : Resource Record Data
RMM --> UI : Display Resource Record for Editing
UI --> Archivist : Resource Record Edit Form
Archivist -> UI : Submit Updated Record
UI -> RMM : Update Resource Record
RMM -> DB : Apply Record Updates
DB --> RMM : Confirm Update
RMM --> UI : Confirm Updated Record
UI --> Archivist : Display Updated Record Confirmation

### Explanation:
1. **Creating a Resource Record:**
   - The Archivist selects the option to create a new resource through the UI Interface.
   - The UI Interface requests the Authentication Service to validate the Archivist's credentials.
   - Once the credentials are validated, the UI Interface sends a request to the Resource Management Module (RMM) to create a new resource record.
   - The RMM interacts with the CAMS Database to create a new record entry.
   - Upon successful creation, the database confirms the creation back to the RMM, and then the RMM instructs the UI Interface to display a form for entering the new resource record details to the Archivist.

2. **Editing a Resource Record:**
   - The Archivist decides to edit a resource record and accesses the record through the UI Interface.
   - The UI checks the credentials of the Archivist again with the Authentication Service.
   - After validation, the UI requests the Resource Management Module to retrieve the data for the specified resource record.
   - The RMM fetches the record data from the CAMS Database and sends it back to the UI, which then displays the record for editing to the Archivist.
   - Once the Archivist submits the updated record, the UI sends the updated details to the RMM, which then applies these updates in the database.
   - After the database confirms the update, the RMM signals the UI to display an updated record confirmation to the Archivist.

This sequence diagram abstracts the main steps involved in creating and editing a resource record within the Comprehensive Archival Management System from the perspective of an Archivist, highlighting the system's modular design and the flow of data. Adjustments may be required based on actual system design, security requirements, and error handling mechanisms.

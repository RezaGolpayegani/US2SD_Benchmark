Below is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax that outlines the process involved in the user story where "As a Data Publishing User, I want to have the Packager support Constants, so that I can model dimensions that may not exist in the source file." 

This sequence diagram assumes the existence of a graphical user interface (GUI) for the data Packager, a backend server managing data processing, and a datastore where datasets are stored. The diagram illustrates the steps from initiating the constant addition process to the data modeling with the newly added constants.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Packager GUI" as GUI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Datastore" as Datastore

User -> GUI: Select dataset for editing
GUI -> User: Show dataset editing options
User -> GUI: Choose to add constants
GUI -> User: Show constants addition interface

User -> GUI: Input constant details (name, value, etc.)
GUI -> Backend: Send constant addition request
activate Backend
Backend -> Backend: Validate constant details
alt Invalid Details
    Backend -> GUI: Respond with validation error
    GUI -> User: Display error message
    deactivate Backend
else Valid Details
    Backend -> Datastore: Store new constant in dataset model
    activate Datastore
    Datastore -> Backend: Confirm constant addition
    deactivate Datastore
    
    Backend -> GUI: Confirm successful addition
    deactivate Backend
    GUI -> User: Display success message
end

User -> GUI: Request to save and reprocess dataset
GUI -> Backend: Send reprocessing request with new constants
activate Backend
Backend -> Backend: Integrate constants into data model
Backend -> Datastore: Update dataset with new model
activate Datastore
Datastore -> Backend: Confirm dataset update
deactivate Datastore

Backend -> GUI: Confirm successful dataset update
deactivate Backend
GUI -> User: Notify dataset update success

This diagram illustrates the general process flow from a user's perspective where the user interacts with the Packager GUI to add constants to a dataset, and how these additions are processed and stored in the background. It's simplified for clarity and assumes successful operation except for a validation check on the details of the new constant.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for user story â€”"As a researcher, I want to export descriptive data in a common format, so that I can use text mining tools on it," involves illustrating the interactions between the researcher, the digital archive system, and potentially other components involved in the export process. Given the nature of your request, let's focus on a simplified version that encapsulates the key steps:

```plaintext
@startuml

participant Researcher as R
participant "Web Interface" as WI
participant "Archive System" as AS
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Export Service" as ES
participant "File System" as FS

R->WI: Request to export descriptive data
WI->AS: Initiate export request
AS->DB: Query searchable metadata
DB->AS: Return metadata results

AS->ES: Prepare data in common format
ES->FS: Fetch relevant files and metadata
FS->ES: Return files and metadata
ES->AS: Compile files and metadata
AS->WI: Provide download link for compiled data
WI->R: Display download link

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Researcher (R)** initiates the process by requesting to export descriptive data in a common format through the **Web Interface (WI)**.
2. The **Web Interface** forwards this request to the **Archive System (AS)**.
3. The **Archive System** queries the **Database (DB)** for the required searchable metadata.
4. The **Database** returns the metadata results to the **Archive System**.
5. The **Archive System** communicates with the **Export Service (ES)** to prepare the data in the requested common format.
6. The **Export Service** may need to fetch relevant files and their associated metadata from the **File System (FS)**.
7. The **File System** returns the requested files and metadata to the **Export Service**.
8. The **Export Service** compiles the files and metadata into the requested format and sends this information back to the **Archive System**.
9. The **Archive System** then provides a download link or method for this compiled data back to the **Web Interface**.
10. Finally, the **Web Interface** displays this downloadable link to the **Researcher**, completing the process.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in exporting descriptive data for a researcher. The specifics of the common format (such as CSV, JSON, XML, etc.), the nature of the searchable metadata, and the security measures for data transmission are abstracted for simplification.

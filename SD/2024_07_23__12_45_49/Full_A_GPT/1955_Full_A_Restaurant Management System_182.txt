To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the amount of products in stock" using PlantUML, you will first need to understand the sequence of actions that occur from the moment the manager decides to check the inventory levels until the information is displayed. The following is an example of how this interaction might be structured in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Backend System" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

== Check Product Stock Levels ==
Manager -> MI : Select view stock
activate MI
MI -> BS : Request inventory data
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query product amounts
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return product amounts
deactivate DB
BS --> MI : Send inventory data
deactivate BS
MI --> Manager : Display product amounts
deactivate MI
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps involved when a manager uses the Restaurant Management and Operations System to view the amount of products in stock. Here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. **Manager to Management Interface**: The manager initiates the process by selecting the option to view stock levels in the management UI (User Interface).
2. **Management Interface to Backend System**: The management UI forwards the manager's request to the backend system to fetch the inventory data.
3. **Backend System to Database**: The backend system queries the database for the current amounts of all products in stock.
4. **Database to Backend System**: The database returns the requested product amounts to the backend system.
5. **Backend System to Management Interface**: With the inventory data received from the database, the backend system processes and sends this information back to the management UI.
6. **Management Interface to Manager**: Finally, the management UI displays the product stock levels to the manager.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and can be extended with more detail, such as error handling, specific data attributes (e.g., product names, IDs, quantities), and more, depending on the complexity required for your project or documentation needs.

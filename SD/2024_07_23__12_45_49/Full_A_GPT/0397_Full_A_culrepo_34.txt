Creating a detailed sequence diagram to represent the user story of a researcher wanting to discover items in the repository through the library's discovery system and Google requires understanding the interaction between systems and users. Below is a simplified PlantUML code that outlines the sequence of actions from the researcher's initial search to accessing the desired content in the digital repository system.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher
participant Google
participant LibraryDiscoverySystem
participant DigitalRepository

Researcher -> Google : Enter search terms
Google -> DigitalRepository : Fetch information
DigitalRepository -> Google : Return indexed pages
Google -> Researcher : Display results
Researcher -> LibraryDiscoverySystem : Enter search terms
LibraryDiscoverySystem -> DigitalRepository : Query for items
DigitalRepository -> LibraryDiscoverySystem : Return search results
LibraryDiscoverySystem -> Researcher : Show items in repository
Researcher -> DigitalRepository : Select item for access
DigitalRepository -> Researcher : Provide access to item (Verify permissions, Fetch item)

This sequence diagram starts with the researcher querying both Google and the library's discovery system for items in the repository. It shows the process flow from the initial search to accessing an item within the digital repository. 

**Key Points in the Sequence:**

1. **Search Initiation:** The researcher initiates two separate searches, one through Google and another through the library's discovery system, using relevant search terms.

2. **Fetching and Returning Information:** 
   - When searching through Google, the digital repository provides Google with indexed pages containing the search terms, allowing Google to return these results to the researcher.
   - When the researcher uses the library's discovery system, it directly queries the digital repository, which then returns a list of relevant items.

3. **Accessing Content:**
   - Once the researcher identifies an item of interest from the search results, they request to access it directly from the digital repository.
   - The repository verifies the researcher's permissions (if necessary) before providing access to the item.

4. **Interaction With Systems:** The diagram highlights interactions between the researcher and Google, the library's discovery system, and the digital repository, showcasing how the systems work together to facilitate the researcher's access to content.

This diagram can be detailed further based on the specific technical interactions, such as API calls between systems, authentication mechanisms, and detailed steps for content retrieval and access permissions validation.

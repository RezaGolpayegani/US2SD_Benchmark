Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to delete the paying subscriptions" requires illustrating how different system components interact with each other to accomplish this functionality. To keep the sequence diagram clear and focused, let's assume the manager interacts with the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) via a web interface, which then processes the request through backend services to ultimately update the database.

Given the complexity of drawing diagrams in plain text, below is a PlantUML representation that outlines the sequence of actions required for a manager to delete paying subscriptions within the CLMS.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager

participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Authentication Service" as AuthService
participant "Subscription Management\nService" as SubsService
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> WebUI : Selects Delete Subscription
WebUI -> AuthService : Authenticate Manager
AuthService -> WebUI : Authentication Success

WebUI -> SubsService : Request to Delete Subscription (subId)
alt Subscription Exists and Manager has permission
    SubsService -> DB : Delete Subscription Record (subId)
    DB --> SubsService : Confirm Deletion
    SubsService -> WebUI : Deletion Success
    WebUI -> Manager : Show Success Message
else Subscription Does Not Exist or\nManager Lacks Permission
    SubsService -> WebUI : Show Error Message
    WebUI -> Manager : Display Error
end
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram begins with the manager selecting the option to delete a subscription through the web interface. The web interface then requests authentication from the authentication service to ensure that the manager is permitted to perform this action. Once authenticated successfully, the web interface sends a deletion request to the subscription management service with a specific subscription identifier (subId).

The subscription management service checks if the subscription exists and if the manager has the necessary permissions. If both conditions are met, the service requests the database to delete the subscription record. Upon successful deletion, the database confirms the action to the subscription management service, which then informs the web interface to display a success message to the manager.

If the subscription does not exist or the manager does not have the required permissions, the subscription management service will instruct the web interface to display an error message to the manager.

This outline assumes a basic level of access control and subscription management functionality within the CLMS, and it can be expanded or adjusted based on more detailed requirements or system architecture specifics.

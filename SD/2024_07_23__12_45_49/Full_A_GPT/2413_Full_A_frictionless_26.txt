Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you have in mind involves depicting the interactions between the Developer, the DPIE system, and the DAT integration. Given the complexity and the range of operations DPIE is capable of, a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML could highlight the main steps in the integration process.

Below is a basic PlantUML code snippet that outlines a possible sequence when a Developer wants to integrate data-packaged data with pipelines that use DAT:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant "DPIE API" as DPIE
participant "DAT Integration Module" as DAT

Developer -> DPIE: Request DAT Integration
activate DPIE
DPIE -> DAT: Initialize Integration
activate DAT
DAT -> DPIE: Fetch Data Package Configurations
activate DPIE
DPIE --> DAT: Return Configuration Details
deactivate DPIE
DAT -> DAT: Process Configuration and Setup
DAT --> DPIE: Integration setup complete
deactivate DAT
DPIE --> Developer: DAT Integration Successful
deactivate DPIE
@enduml
```

To utilize this PlantUML code:

1. Copy the code.
2. Visit a PlantUML editor or integrator (Many are available online for free).
3. Paste the code into the editor.
4. The editor should render the sequence diagram based on the input.

This diagram starts with the Developer initiating a request to the DPIE system for DAT integration. DPIE communicates with the DAT integration module to prepare and process data package configurations. Finally, the successful setup is acknowledged back to the DPIE system and then to the developer.

Keep in awareness that this is a conceptual diagram. The actual implementation details may require interactions with additional components such as data validation, user authentication, or error handling systems, depending on the DPIE system's architecture and the specific requirements of the DAT integration.

To make the diagram more detailed, you could expand on each interaction, perhaps by specifying the exact data being passed between components (like configuration files or API keys), or by adding more steps that depict error handling or conditional logic (e.g., what happens if DAT integration fails).

Remember, the key to a useful sequence diagram is understanding the interactions that are most critical to the process you're trying to depict, so you may adjust the level of detail based on your specific needs and audience.

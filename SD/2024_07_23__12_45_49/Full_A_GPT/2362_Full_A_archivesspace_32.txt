Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story you've provided involves illustrating the interactions between the archivist and the components of the Comprehensive Archical Management System (CAMS) when creating and editing a Collection Management subrecord. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that outlines this process.

Please note this example assumes a simplified scenario where the archivist interacts through a user interface, which then communicates with a backend system responsible for handling the creation and editing of Collection Management subrecords. Adjustments might be necessary to suit the specific architecture and workflows of CAMS.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as archivist
participant "UI Component" as ui
participant "Controller" as controller
participant "Collection Management\nService" as service
database "Archival Database" as db

== Creating a Collection Management Subrecord ==
archivist -> ui : Select option to create\nCollection Management subrecord
ui -> controller : invoke createSubrecord()
controller -> service : createSubrecord()
service -> db : insert new subrecord details
db --> service : confirm creation
service --> controller : return creation status
controller --> ui : display creation status
ui --> archistar : show success/failure message

== Editing a Collection Management Subrecord ==
archivist -> ui : Select and edit\nCollection Management subrecord
ui -> controller : invoke editSubrecord(subrecordId, newDetails)
controller -> service : editSubrecord(subrecordId, newDetails)
service -> db : update subrecord details
db --> service : confirm update
service --> controller : return update status
controller --> ui : display update status
ui --> archistar : show success/failure message

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the Archivist (actor) wanting to create or edit a Collection Management subrecord. The steps are as follows:

1. The Archivist selects the option to create or edit a Collection Management subrecord through the UI Component. 
2. The UI Component sends the request to a Controller.
3. For creation, the Controller asks the Collection Management Service to create a new subrecord, which, in turn, interacts with the Archival Database to insert the new subrecord details. 
4. For editing, the Controller sends the subrecord ID and the new details to be updated to the Collection Management Service, which updates the respective subrecord in the Archival Database.
5. The database confirms the creation or update action back to the Collection Management Service.
6. The Collection Management Service returns the status (success or failure) of the action to the Controller.
7. The Controller then communicates the status back to the UI Component.
8. Finally, the UI Component displays a success or failure message to the Archivist based on the response from the Controller.

This sequence diagram is a high-level representation and might need adjustments based on the detailed architecture of the Comprehensive Archival Management System.

Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story you've provided involves depicting the interactions between different system components and actors to accomplish the goal of modifying a group's information. Below is an example of how you might represent this process. Please note, to convert this PlantUML code into a visual diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML editor or compatible tool.

```
@startuml
actor Administrator as admin
participant "Camp Management\nSystem" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Modify Group Information Flow ==

admin -> CMS : Select Group to Modify
CMS -> DB : Retrieve Selected Group Information
DB -> CMS : Return Group Information
CMS -> admin : Display Group Information
admin -> CMS : Modify Group Information
CMS -> DB : Update Group Information in Database
DB -> CMS : Confirm Update
CMS -> admin : Display Update Confirmation

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Flow:

1. **Select Group to Modify**: The process starts with the camp administrator selecting a group whose information needs to be modified. This action is an interaction between the administrator and the Camp Management System (CMS).

2. **Retrieve Selected Group Information**: The CMS requests the current information of the selected group from the database.

3. **Return Group Information**: The database returns the information of the selected group to the CMS.

4. **Display Group Information**: The CMS displays the group's current information to the administrator, allowing them to see what details are currently on record.

5. **Modify Group Information**: The administrator makes the desired changes to the group's information through the CMS interface.

6. **Update Group Information in Database**: The CMS sends the modified group information to the database to update the existing records.

7. **Confirm Update**: The database confirms that the group's information has been updated and notifies the CMS.

8. **Display Update Confirmation**: Finally, the CMS displays a confirmation to the administrator that the group's information has been successfully updated.

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions and steps involved in modifying a group's information within a camp management context, as described in your project overview.

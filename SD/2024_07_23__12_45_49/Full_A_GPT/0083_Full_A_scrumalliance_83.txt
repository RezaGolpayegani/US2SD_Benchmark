Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that represents the process a trainer would follow to load an Excel file into the site so that the course participants are added to the Scrum Alliance records. This sequence includes interaction between the trainer, the web interface, a file processing system, and the database. Note that this diagram assumes a simplified process for readability and understanding.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Trainer
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "File Processing System" as FPS
participant "Database" as DB

Trainer -> Web : Upload Excel File
activate Web

Web -> FPS : Send file for processing
activate FPS

FPS -> FPS : Validate file format
alt file format is valid
    FPS -> FPS : Extract data
    note right: Data includes\nparticipant details
    FPS -> DB : Insert participant records
    activate DB
    DB --> FPS : Acknowledge record addition
    deactivate DB
    
    FPS --> Web : Confirm upload success
else file format is invalid
    FPS --> Web : Error: Invalid file format
end
deactivate FPS

alt upload success
    Web --> Trainer : Display success message
else upload failure
    Web --> Trainer : Display error message
end

deactivate Web

### Explanation:
- **Trainer uploads an Excel file:** The sequence begins with the Trainer uploading an Excel file through the Web Interface. This file contains the details of course participants that need to be added to the Scrum Alliance records.
- **File processing:** The Web Interface sends the file to the File Processing System (FPS) for processing. The FPS first validates the file format to ensure it's in Excel format (or whatever format is expected). If the format is valid, it proceeds to extract data from the file. This data extraction involves pulling participant details contained within the Excel file.
- **Database interaction:** Once the data is extracted, the FPS interacts with the Database (DB) to insert the participant records. The DB acknowledges this insertion.
- **Success or error feedback:** Following the DB's acknowledgment, the FPS informs the Web Interface whether the upload was successful or not. The Web Interface then displays a corresponding success or error message to the Trainer.
- **Alternative paths:** The diagram includes alternative paths for both the file validation step (valid vs. invalid format) and the final upload outcome (success vs. failure), ensuring clarity on how different scenarios are handled.

This sequence diagram outlines a clear process flow for the described user story, showing the interactions between different system components to achieve the functionality of adding course participants to the Scrum

Alliance records via an Excel file upload.

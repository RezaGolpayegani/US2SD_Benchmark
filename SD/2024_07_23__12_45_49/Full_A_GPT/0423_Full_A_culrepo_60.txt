Given your request, below is a detailed PlantUML code snippet to create a sequence diagram for the user story: "As an administrator, I want to have a platform that can support a variety of media file and text-based formats, so that the intellectual output of the school can be showcased and preserved in a more comprehensive way."

The sequence diagram will depict the interaction between the administrator and the digital repository system, including file uploading and format support verification steps.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Administrator as admin
participant "Digital Repository System" as system
participant "Content Management Module" as content
participant "Format Support Check" as formatCheck
participant Database as db

== Check Format Support ==
admin -> system: Request format support info
activate system
system -> formatCheck: Retrieve supported formats
activate formatCheck
formatCheckout -> system: Return supported formats list
deactivate formatCheck
system -> admin: Display supported formats
deactivate system

== Upload Process ==
admin -> system: Initiate file upload
activate system
system -> content: Upload requested
activate content
admin -> content: Select files for upload
loop for each file
    content -> formatCheck: Verify format
    activate formatCheck
    alt If file format is supported
        formatCheck --> content: Format verified
        deactivate formatCheck
        content -> db: Save file metadata
        activate db
        db --> content: File metadata saved
        deactivate db
        content --> admin: File upload successful
    else File format not supported
        formatCheck --> content: Format unsupported
        deactivate formatCheck
        content --> admin: File format error
    end
end
deactivate content
deactivate system

This diagram illustrates the following steps:
1. The administrator requests information about supported formats from the digital repository system.
2. The system retrieves and displays the supported formats to the administrator.
3. The administrator initiates the file upload process through the system.
4. For each selected file, the system checks if the file format is supported.
5. If a file's format is supported, it saves the file metadata to the database and notifies the administrator of a successful upload.
6. If a file's format is not supported, the system notifies the administrator of the error.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of the interactions required to support and manage a variety technically diverse files within the digital repository system, focusing on the administrator's perspective in ensuring comprehensive showcase and preservation of intellectual outputs.

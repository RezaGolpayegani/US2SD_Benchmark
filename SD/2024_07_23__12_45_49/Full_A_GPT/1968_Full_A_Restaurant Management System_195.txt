Given your request, I'll outline a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story: "As a manager, I want to see the list of reservations for the whole week so that I can revert back to customers correctly." This diagram will illustrate the interactions between the system components involved in fetching a week's reservation list for a manager.

Note: To visualize this PlantUML code, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or online editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as mgr
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend
participant "Database" as db

mgr -> ui : Accesses reservation view
ui -> backend : Requests weekly reservation data
backend -> db : Query to fetch reservations
db --> backend : Reservations data
backend --> ui : Weekly reservations list
ui --> mgr : Displays reservations

@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. **Manager (`mgr`)**: Initiates the process by accessing the reservations view on the system interface to retrieve information about the week's reservations.
2. **UI Interface (`ui`)**: Acts as an intermediary, forwarding the manager's request to the backend system to obtain the needed reservations data.
3. **Backend System (`backend`)**: Processes the request by querying the database for the list of reservations made for the entire week.
4. **Database (`db`)**: Stores and manages the reservations data, returning the queried information back to the backend.
5. **Backend System (`backend`)**: Receives the reservations data from the database and formats it if necessary before sending it to the UI Interface.
6. **UI Interface (`ui`)**: Receives the formatted list of weekly reservations from the backend and displays it to the manager.

This sequence diagram is simplified to convey the basic flow of operations for the manager's request. Depending on the project's complexity, additional steps or systems (like authentication or a cache layer) might be included in an actual implementation scenario.

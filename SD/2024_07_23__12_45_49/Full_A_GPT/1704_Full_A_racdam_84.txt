Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an archivist, I want to search images by people represented in them" involves various components like the User Interface (UI), Search Controller, Database, and potentially an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service if the images are to be searched based on text derived from them. However, for simplicity and direct relevance to searching by people represented, we'll focus on a tagged-based or metadata-driven search. This assumes that images in the digital archive are tagged with identifiers or names of people represented in them.

Below is the PlantUML code for a sequence continued from where the archivist initiates a search to when they receive the search results. This UML diagram assumes a simple architecture for demonstration purposes.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "UI/Search Interface" as UI
participant "Search Controller" as SC
participant "Database" as DB

title Search Images by People Represented Sequence Diagram

A -> UI : Enters name/tag of person
UI -> SC : Search query for person
activate SC
SC -> DB : Query images by tag
activate DB
DB --> SC : Return image results
deactivate DB
SC --> UI : Display search results
deactivate SC
UI --> A : Shows images with person represented

Explanation of Steps:
1. **Archivist (A)**: The user, in this case, an archivist, starts the process by entering the name or a specific tag associated with the person they are looking for in the search field of the UI/Search Interface.
2. **UI/Search Interface (UI)**: The interface captures the search input (name/tag of the person) and sends this query to the Search Controller.
3. **Search Controller (SC)**: This component processes the incoming query. It's responsible for parsing the search terms and formulating the correct query to send to the Database.
4. **Database (DB)**: The Database receives the query, searches through the collection of image metadata/tags for matches with the specified person's name or tag, and returns a list of images where the person is represented.
5. **Back to Search Controller (SC)**: The Search Controller receives the search results (images list) from the Database.
6. **Back to UI/Search Interface (UI)**: The Search Controller sends the results back to the UI, which then displays the images that match the query to the Archivist.

Please adapt and expand the diagram based on specific technologies, frameworks, or detailed steps involved in your project's architecture. This example assumes a straightforward search based on tags or metadata explicitly mentioning people represented in images, without accounting for more complex image recognition or OCR technologies that might be part of a more advanced archival system's capabilities.

To customize this UML sequence diagram further, consider adding error handling, such as what happens if no images match the search query, or including steps for previewing or accessing detailed views of the images within the search results.

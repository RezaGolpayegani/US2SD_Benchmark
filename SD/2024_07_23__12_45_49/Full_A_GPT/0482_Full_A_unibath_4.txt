To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story, we'll illustrate the interaction between the depositor, the Virtual Research Environment (VRE), the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform, and any other necessary components. Below is a simplified example in PlantUML format that captures the key steps involved when a depositor wants to deposit and maintain datasets through VREs and other workflow tools.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Depositor
participant "Virtual Research\nEnvironment (VRE)" as VRE
participant "Enhanced Research\nData Management\nPlatform" as Platform
database "Data Archive" as Archive

Depositor -> VRE : Initiate dataset deposit
VRE -> VRE : Validate depositor\ncredentials
VRE -> Platform : Request dataset deposit
activate Platform
Platform -> Platform : Generate deposit ID
Platform -> Archive : Store dataset metadata and files
activate Archive
Archive --> Platform : Confirm dataset stored
deactivate Archive
Platform --> VRE : Deposit success\nwith deposit ID
deactivate Platform
VRE --> Depositor : Show success message\nand deposit ID

Depositor -> VRE : Initiate dataset update
VRE -> Platform : Request dataset update\nwith deposit ID
activate Platform
Platform -> Archive : Update dataset metadata\nand files
activate Archive
Archive --> Platform : Confirm dataset updated
deactivate Archive
Platform --> VRE : Update success
deactivate Platform
VRE --> Depositor : Show update success message

This diagram starts with the depositor initiating the dataset deposit process through a Virtual Research Environment (VRE). The VRE validates the depositor's credentials and sends a request to the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform to deposit the dataset. The platform then generates a deposit ID, stores the dataset's metadata and files in the Data Archive, and returns a success message with the deposit ID to the VRE, which in turn informs the depositor of the successful deposit.

For dataset maintenance, including updates, the depositor initiates the update process through the VRE, which requests the update from the platform using the deposit ID. The platform updates the dataset in the Data Archive and confirms the update to the VRE, which then informs the depositor.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interaction flow. Depending on the project's complexity, you might need to add detailed error handling, additional steps for managing large file uploads, specifying embargoes, or generating DOIs.

Remember, this example illustrates the general process. Your actual implementation might require more detailed interactions to accommodate specific requirements of the Enhanced Research Data Management Platform and the VREs used by the University of Bath.

Given your project description and focusing on the user story for checking product inventory as a restaurant employee, I'll draft a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence demonstrates interactions among components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Inventory Management" as Inventory
participant "Database" as DB

Employee -> UI: Request to check product availability
UI -> Backend: Fetch product availability details
activate Backend
Backend -> Inventory: Query product availability
activate Inventory
Inventory -> DB: SELECT available_quantity FROM products WHERE product_id = XYZ
activate DB
DB --> Inventory: Return product availability
Inventory --> Backend: Product availability details
deactivate DB
Backend --> UI: Display product availability status
UI --> Employee: Show product availability
deactivate Inventory
deactivate Backend

### Explanation:

1. **Employee Initiates Request:** The sequence starts when a restaurant employee wants to check the availability of a product to inform a customer accurately.
2. **UI Interface Interaction:** The employee interacts with the user interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, requesting product availability.
3. **Backend Processing:** The backend server receives the request and then processes it, forwarding the request to the Inventory Management subsystem for the specific details.
4. **Inventory Management Query:** The Inventory Management subsystem queries the database to retrieve the current availability status of the requested product (e.g., how many units are in stock).
5. **Database Response:** The Database Management System processes the query and returns the requested information back to the Inventory Management subsystem.
6. **Result Propagation:** The product availability details are then sent back to the backend server from the Inventory Management subsystem.
7. **User Interface Update:** Finally, the backend server updates the UI Interface with the product's availability status, which in turn displays the information to the employee.

Note: The above sequence assumes a simplified view focusing on the core components and interactions. Real-world implementations might include additional layers, such as authentication and authorization checks, error handling, and logging processes.

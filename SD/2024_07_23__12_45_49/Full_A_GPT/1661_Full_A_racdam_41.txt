To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story, we need to focus on the process a researcher would go through to locate photographs and documents, verify their shareability status, and then share those on social Christianity. Below is a sequence diagram designed to encapsulate these processes, tailored for use in the context described in the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as res
participant "Search & Browse\nFunctionality" as search
participant "Database" as db
participant "Rights Management\nSystem" as rights
participant "Social Media\nInterface" as sm

== Locate Shareable Content ==
res -> search : Enter keywords/tags
search -> db : Query photographs/documents
db -> search : Return results
search -> res : Display results

== Verify Shareability ==
res -> rights : Check license/rights of selected content
rights -> db : Retrieve license/rights information
db -> rights : License/rights data
rights -> res : Confirm shareable status

== Share on Social Media ==
res -> sm : Access sharing interface
res -> sm : Choose platform & Share
sm -> db : Log activity (optional)

This sequence diagram illustrates the steps a researcher would follow to locate and share photographs and documents on social media using the digital archive's functionalities:

1. **Locate Shareable Content**: The process begins with the researcher entering search criteria (keywords or tags) into the search and browse functionality. This system queries the database and returns relevant results to the researcher.

2. **Verify Shareability**: The researcher selects content of interest and checks its license or rights through the Rights Management System. This system, in turn, fetches the license or rights information from the database to ascertain if the content can be legally shared. It then informs the researcher of the content's shareability status.

3. **Share on Social Media**: If the content is shareable, the researcher can proceed to use the social media interface to select the platform and share the content. The system might optionally log this activity in the database for record-keeping or statistical purposes.

This diagram can be refined further depending on more specific requirements or additional steps in the process, such as requiring the researcher to log in, more specific interactions with the Rights Management System, or integrating directly with social media platforms for streamlined sharing capabilities.

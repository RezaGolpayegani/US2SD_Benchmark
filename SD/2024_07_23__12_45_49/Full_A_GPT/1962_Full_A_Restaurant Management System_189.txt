Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the customer satisfaction ratio" in PlantUML language demands outlining the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Below is a simplistic approach to illustrate this process. 

Please note that this is a foundational reference and might need adjustments based on specific system design and requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant Browser as B
participant Server as S
participant AnalyticsService as AS
participant Database as DB

M -> B: Requests customer satisfaction ratio
B -> S: GET /customerSatisfactionRatio
S -> AS: calculateSatisfactionRatio()
AS -> DB: queryFeedbackAndRatings()
DB --> AS: returns data
AS --> S: ratioCalculated
S --> B: satisfactionRatioResult
B --> M: Displays Customer Satisfaction Ratio

note over M: Manager views \n satisfaction ratio on dashboard
note over AS: AnalyticsService calculates \n the ratio based on feedbacks \n and ratings
note right of DB: Database holds feedback \n and ratings data

### Explanation:
- **Manager (M):** The manager begins the process by requesting to view the customer satisfaction ratio, which is a crucial metric for gauging overall customer satisfaction.
- **Browser (B):** Represents the manager's interface with the system, possibly a web application.
- **Server (S):** Acts as the middleman that processes requests from the browser and fetches the necessary data.
- **AnalyticsService (AS):** A dedicated service or module within the system designed to handle analytics, including calculations of key performance indicators like customer satisfaction ratios.
- **Database (DB):** Stores all data related to customer feedback, ratings, and possibly other relevant metrics.

### Process Flow:
1. The manager initiates the request from their browser or dashboard.
2. The server receives the request and forwards it to the AnalyticsService.
3. The AnalyticsService then makes a request to the database to fetch all necessary data for calculating the satisfaction ratio.
4. Upon receiving the data, the AnalyticsService calculates the customer satisfaction ratio.
5. The calculated ratio is sent back to the server.
6. The server then sends the satisfaction ratio result back to the browser.
7. Finally, the manager can view the customer satisfaction ratio on their dashboard.

This sequence diagram represents a high-level process flow and does not cover error handling, security concerns, or detailed interactions that might also be important components of the actual implementation. Depending on the complexity of the restaurant management system, additional steps, services, or processes might be included.

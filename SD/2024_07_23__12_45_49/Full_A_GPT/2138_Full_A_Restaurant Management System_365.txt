Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to see table orders from the cellular system," requires illustrating the interactions between different components of the system to fulfill this request. Since PlantUML is a text-based language used to draw diagrams, below is a notational representation of how such a sequence might look in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant WebInterface as WI
participant Server as S
participant Database as DB

E -> WI : Request table orders view
activate WI

WI -> S : Fetch table orders
activate S

S -> DB : Query table orders
activate DB

DB --> S : Return orders data
deactivate DB

S --> WI : Orders data
deactivate S

WI --> E : Display table orders
deactivate WI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with an Employee who wants to view the table orders. Here's a brief rundown of the steps:

1. **Employee to Web Interface**: The process begins with the employee requesting to view table orders through the system's web interface. This could be a dashboard or a specific section within the software designed for employees to manage and view table orders.

2. **Web Interface to Server**: The web interface forwards this request to the server. This step involves sending a request to retrieve the necessary order data from the system's backend.

3. **Server to Database**: The server then processes this request and queries the database for the table orders. This involves fetching all relevant order information stored in the database that matches the criteria for what the employee wishes to see (e.g., all current table orders, specific table orders by number, or status).

4. **Database to Server**: The database returns the queried table orders data to the server. This data is then processed, potentially formatted, or further filtered according to the needs of the request.

5. **Server to Web Interface**: The server sends the table orders data back to the web interface, completing the data retrieval cycle.

6. **Web Interface to Employee**: Finally, the web interface displays the table orders to the employee. This step concludes the process by fulfilling the employee's request to view table orders.

Each activation bar (represented by `activate` and `deactivate` in PlantUML) indicates the period during which an actor or object is performing an action in response to the flow of events in this sequence diagram.

This diagram and description are simplified to focus on the key steps involving an employee requesting and viewing table orders within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Depending on the system's complexity and additional features, more steps or different technologies might be involved in the process.

Given your request, I've crafted a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that captures the interaction process between the Data Consuming User and the OpenSpending platform for downloading an image of a particular view state for offline use. This sequence showcases the steps from initiating the request to completing the download.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Consuming User" as user
participant "OpenSpending Web Interface" as web
participant "Visualization Service" as viz
participant "Image Generation Service" as img
database "Data Store" as db

user -> web: Access visualization feature
web -> viz: Request current view state data
viz -> db: Fetch data for visualization
db -> viz: Return requested data
viz -> web: Display current visualization
user -> web: Request download of view state image
web -> img: Send request for image generation
activate img
img -> viz: Request specific data for image
viz -> db: Fetch necessary data
db -> viz: Provide data
viz -> img: Return visualization data
img -> img: Generate image from view state
img -> web: Provide generated image
deactivate commodities
web -> user: Offer image download link
user -> web: Download image

This sequence diagram begins with the Data Consuming User accessing the visualization feature on the OpenSpending Web Interface. Upon the request to download an image of the particular view state, the OpenSpending Web Interface interacts with an Image Generation Service. This service might fetch necessary data once more from the Visualization Service, which in turn might need to pull specific data points from the Data Store. After generating the image based on the requested view state, the Image Generation Service passes the image back to the Web Interface, which then provides the Data Consuming User with a downloadable link.

Please note, sequence diagrams are abstract and designed to illustrate the flow of actions; the actual implementation details may vary based on the project's technical architecture, the technologies used, and specific requirements not covered in the description.

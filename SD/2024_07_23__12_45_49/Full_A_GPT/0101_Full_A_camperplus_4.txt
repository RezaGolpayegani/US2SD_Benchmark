To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a camp administrator, I want to be able to upload consent forms, so that campers or their parents can easily access the forms" using PlantUML format, you'd want to visualize the interaction between the camp administrator, the system (the Camp Management & Communication Platform), and potentially the database where the consent forms are stored, as well as the acknowledgment from the system back to the admin and the notification sent to parents. Below is a simple example of how you might define this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Camp Administrator" as admin
participant "Management System" as system
database "Database" as db
actor "Parent" as parent

== Upload Consent Forms ==
admin -> system : Upload consent form
activate admin
activate system

system -> db : Save consent form details
activate db

db --> system : Confirmation of saved form
deactivate db

system --> admin: Acknowledge upload success
deactivate system

== Notification to Parents ==
system -> parent : Notify available consent form
activate system
activate parent

parent --> system : Acknowledge Notification
deactivate parent
deactivate system


@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the "Camp Administrator" initiating the upload process of a consent form. The system then processes this request, which includes saving the form details into the database. Upon successful saving, the system acknowledges the upload success back to the admin. Following the successful upload, the system also notifies parents that a new consent form is available, illustrating the full end-to-end process based on the project description provided. 

Remember, for more complex scenarios or additional details, you might need to expand on this diagram, for instance, including error handling (e.g., what happens if the upload fails or if saving to the database is not successful), or more nuanced steps in the consent form dissemination process (e.g., parents accessing and signing the form).

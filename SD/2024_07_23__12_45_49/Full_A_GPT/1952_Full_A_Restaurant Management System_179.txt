To generate a sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see our top-selling menu items, so that I can focus on offering the right products" using PlantUML, we'll need to outline the interactions between different parts of the system. This diagram will focus on the process when a manager requests to view top-selling menu items and how this data is retrieved and displayed.

Please note, you will need to copy this code into a PlantUML editor or a tool that supports PlantUML diagrams to visualize it.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Dashboard" as MD
participant BackendServer as BS
participant Database as DB

M -> MD : Request top-selling menu items
MD -> BS : GET /top-selling-items
activate BS
BS -> DB : Query top-selling menu items
activate DB
DB --> BS : Return top-selling items data
deactivate DB
BS --> MD : Top-selling items data
deactivate BS
MD --> M : Display top-selling menu items
@enduml
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what each line in the sequence diagram represents:

1. **Manager to Management Dashboard**: The manager (M) starts the process by requesting to see the top-selling menu items through the Management Dashboard (MD).

2. **Management Dashboard to Backend Server**: The MD then sends a request to the Backend Server (BS) to retrieve data for the top-selling menu items. This is shown as a GET request to the `/top-selling-items` endpoint.

3. **Backend Server to Database**: The BS sends a query to the Database (DB) to fetch the top-selling menu items. This involves querying sales data and aggregating the total number of sales per menu item to determine which items are selling the best.

4. **Database to Backend Server**: The DB processes the query and returns the requested data, which includes details on the top-selling items, to the BS.

5. **Backend Server to Management Dashboard**: The BS processes the data and then sends it back to the MD, which will format and prepare the data for display.

6. **Management Dashboard to Manager**: Finally, the MD displays the top-selling menu items to the manager, who can now make informed decisions about which products to focus on.

This sequence diagram lays out the interactions between different components of the system when a manager requests top-selling items data, showcasing how the system supports decision-making processes for restaurant management.

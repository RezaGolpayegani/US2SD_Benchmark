To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to chat with users" using PlantUML, first let's outline the steps involved in this process:

1. **Librarian Initiates Chat**: The librarian decides to initiate a chat with a user. This could be in response to a query raised by a user or as a proactive measure to offer assistance.
2. **System Validates Librarian**: Before proceeding, the system checks whether the librarian has been authenticated and has the permissions to initiate chats.
3. **Locate User**: The librarian selects the user to chat with, possibly by searching for the user in the system based on their user ID or name.
4. **System Validates User**: The system checks whether the selected user exists and is available for chat.
5. **Open Chat Window**: Upon successful validation, the chat window is opened for the librarian to communicate with the user.
6. **Message Exchange**: Messages are sent back and forth between the librarian and the user.
7. **Close Chat**: The chat is ended by either the librarian or the user.

Here's how you can represent the above steps in a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
entity "Chat System" as System
actor User

Librarian -> System : Initiate Chat
activate System

System -> System : Validate Librarian
System -> System : Locate and Validate User

System --> Librarian : Open Chat Window
Librarian -> User : Chat Message
activate User

User --> Librarian : Reply Message
deactivate User

Librarian -> System : End Chat
System -> User : Notify Chat End
deactivate System

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram script starts with the Librarian initiating a chat through the Chat System. The system validates the librarian's credentials and then locates the user to validate their availability. Upon successful validation, the chat window is opened, and messages can be exchanged between the Librarian and the User. Finally, the chat is ended by the librarian, and the chat system notifies the user of the chat end.

Please note that in real implementations, more steps could be involved, such as authentication processes, logging, and handling of errors or edge cases, which you might want to consider depending on the complexity and requirements of your Library Management System.

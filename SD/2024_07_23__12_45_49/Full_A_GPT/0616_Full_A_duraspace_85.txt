Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves depicting the interactions between the DAMS manager, the DIMS system, and possibly other components involved in the process of tracking modifications to copyright status for an object or object component. Here's a PlantUML representation of how this scenario could be depicted:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DAMS Manager" as manager
participant "DIMS System" as DIMS
participant "Copyright Database" as database
participant "Notification System" as notification

manager -> DIMS : Request copyright status
DIMS -> database : Query copyright status
database --> DIMS : Return current status
DIMS --> manager : Display current copyright status

alt Manual Update
    manager -> DIMS : Update copyright status manually
    DIMS -> database : Update status
    database --> DIMS : Confirm update
    DIMS -> notification : Trigger notification
    notification --> manager : Notify copyright status change
else Automatic Update Detected
    database -> DIMS : Inform automatic status change
    DIMS -> notification : Trigger notification
    notification --> manager : Notify copyright status change
end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines a process where:

1. The DAMS manager requests the current copyright status from the DIMS system.
2. DIMS queries the copyright database for the current status.
3. The database returns the status to DIMS, which then displays it to the DAMS manager.
4. If a manual update is made:
   - The manager updates the copyright status manually through DIMS.
   - DIMS updates the status in the database.
   - The database confirms the update to DIMS.
   - DIMS triggers a notification of the status change.
   - The manager receives a notification of the change.
5. If an automatic update is detected:
   - The database informs DIMS of the automatic status change.
   - DIMS triggers a notification.
   - The manager receives a notification of the change.

This diagram is simplified for the scope of the user story and assumes the existence of a notification system within DIMS to alert the DAMS manager of changes. Depending on the actual system architecture and requirements, there might be additional steps, error handling, or systems involved in the process.

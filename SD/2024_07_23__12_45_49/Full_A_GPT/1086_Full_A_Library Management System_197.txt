To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see library members," we need to outline the interactions between the different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This sequence will highlight the journey from when a manager requests to view library members to when the system displays those members.

This diagram assumes that there is a web-based interface for the manager to interact with, a backend server to process requests, and a database where member information is stored.

Here's the PlantUML code representing the sequence diagram for this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager Interface" as Manager
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Backend: Request to view library members
activate Backend

Backend -> DB: Query for member information
activate DB

DB -> Backend: Return member information
deactivate DB

Backend -> Manager: Display member information
deactivate Backend

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Manager Interface to Backend Server:**
   - The sequence starts when the manager interacts with the Manager Interface (likely a webpage or an application within the Comprehensive Library Management System) to request a view of the library members. This action sends a request to the Backend Server.
   
2. **Backend Server to Database:**
   - Upon receiving the request, the Backend Server processes it and queries the Database for the information about the library members. This query retrieves the necessary data to fulfill the manager's request.
   
3. **Database to Backend Server:**
   - The Database processes the query and returns the member information to the Backend Server. This step involves accessing and retrieving data from the member profiles stored in the Database.
   
4. **Backend Server to Manager Interface:**
   - Finally, the Backend Server receives the member information from the Database and sends it back to the Manager Interface to be displayed to the manager. This completes the process, providing the manager with the information requested about the library members.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow of information and interaction required within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) to allow a manager to view library members. It demonstrates a straightforward query process from initiation by the user (manager) through data retrieval and response presentation.

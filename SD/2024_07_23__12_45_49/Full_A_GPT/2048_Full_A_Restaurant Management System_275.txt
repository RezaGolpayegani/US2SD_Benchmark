Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to clean the reservation for each table" requires illustrating how different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System interact to accomplish this task. Since PlantUML code cannot be visually rendered here, I'll provide the PlantUML source code which you can use in PlantUML compatible software or online editors to visualize the sequence diagram.

This scenario starts with the waiter initiating the process to clear a reservation after customers have left, ensuring the table is ready for new guests. The system updates the reservation status and notifies the relevant stakeholders.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Waiter Interface" as WInterface
participant "Reservation System" as ReservationSys
participant "Table Management" as TableMgmt
participant "Notification Service" as NotifyServ
database "Restaurant Database" as RestaurantDB

== Clear Table Reservation ==

Waiter -> WInterface: Select option to clear table
WInterface -> ReservationSys: Request to retrieve current table reservations
ReservationSys -> RestaurantDB: Query reservation details
RestaurantDB -> ReservationSys: Return reservation details
ReservationSys -> WInterface: Show reservations to waiter
WInterface -> Waiter: Display reservations
Waiter -> WInterface: Select reservation to clear
WInterface -> ReservationSys: Send clear table request
ReservationSys -> TableMgmt: Update table status to available
TableMgmt -> RestaurantDB: Update reservation status
RestaurantDB -> TableMgmt: Confirm update
TableMgmt -> ReservationSys: Confirm table cleared
ReservationSys -> NotifyServ: Trigger notifications
NotifyServ -> "Management": Notify reservation cleared
NotifyServ -> "Host/Hostess": Update on table availability
ReservationSys -> WInterface: Confirm reservation cleared to waiter
WInterface -> Waiter: Show confirmation of clear

This sequence diagram outlines the steps taken by the waiter through the system's interfaces to clear a reservation. It shows interactions with the interface, reservation system, table management, notification service, and the restaurant's database. 

To see the diagram, please copy the code into a PlantUML editor or an online PlantUML viewer like http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/.

- Note: The sequence of steps assumes a straightforward reservation clearing process. Depending on the actual requirements, additional steps such as logging, payment processing, or detailed clearing procedures might be included. Adjustments to the diagram may be necessary to reflect specific business logic or additional functionalities within the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

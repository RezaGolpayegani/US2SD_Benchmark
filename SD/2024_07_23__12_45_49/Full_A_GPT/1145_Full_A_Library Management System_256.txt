To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to have a wish list" using PlantUML, we need to illustrate the interactions between different system components involved in adding a book to the member's wish list. Let's assume this functionality allows a member to search for books and add them to a personal wish list for future reference.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "SearchController" as SC
database "Database" as DB
participant "WishListController" as WC
participant "NotificationService" as NS

== Search for Book ==
Member -> UI : Searches for a book
UI -> SC : searchBook("book details")
SC -> DB : queryBook("book details")
DB --> SC : return bookResults
SC --> UI : displayResults(bookResults)
UI --> Member : Show search results

== Add Book to Wish List ==
Member -> UI : Select book to add to wish list
UI -> WC : addToWishList("selectedBookID", "memberID")
WC -> DB : checkIfBookExists("selectedBookID")
DB --> WC : bookExists = true
WC -> DB : addToWishList("selectedBookID", "memberID")
DB --> WC : wishListUpdated = true
WC --> UI : displayConfirmation("Book added to wish list")

== Notification for Wish List Update ==
WC -> NS : sendWishListUpdateNotification("memberID", "selectedBookID")
NS --> DB : getUserContact("memberID")
DB --> NS : return contactDetails
NS -> NS : prepareNotification("contactDetails", "Your wish list has been updated.")
NS --> Member : sendNotification

This sequence diagram represents the process in which a member of the Comprehensive Library Management System searches for a book, selects a book to add to their wish list, and then receives a confirmation about the addition along with a notification update. 

- The **Member** interacts with the **User Interface (UI)** to input their search request.
- The **UI** communicates this request to the **SearchController (SC)**, which then queries the **Database (DB)** for the requested book(s).
- The search results are returned to the **UI** and displayed to the **Member**.
- Upon selecting a book to add to their wish list, the request is sent from the **UI** to the **WishListController (WC)**.
- The **WC** checks with the **DB** if the selected book exists and then proceeds to add it to the member's wish list.
- Upon successful updation, a notification process is triggered by the **WC** communicating with the **NotificationService (NS)**, which fetches the user's contact details from the **DB** and sends out a notification to the **Member** informing them of the update.

This diagram is a high-level representation and can be extended or modified based on more specific requirements or system details not covered in the brief.

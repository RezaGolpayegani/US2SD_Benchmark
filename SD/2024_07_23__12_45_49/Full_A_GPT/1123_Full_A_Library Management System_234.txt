Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story "As a member of the library, I want to reserve books so that I can borrow it when it is available" in PlantUML format involves outlining the interactions between the system components and the user. Below is a representation of the sequence of actions in a reservation process.

This sequence diagram demonstrates a simplified process of reserving a book through the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Member initiates a search**: The library member starts the process by searching for a book through the Library Web Application interface based on various filters like book details.

2. **Availability check**: The Web Application then interacts with the Reservation System to check the availability status of the requested book.

3. **Database query**: The Reservation System queries the database for the book's details and current status (available or reserved).

4. **Book status response**: Based on the book's availability, different paths are followed:
   - If the book is immediately available, the member is informed accordingly.
   - If the book is already reserved or checked out, the Web Application displays a message indicating the book is currently unavailable and offers an option to reserve the book when it returns.

5. **Reservation request**: If the member decides to reserve the book, the Web Application sends a reservation request to the Reservation System with the member's details and book identifier.

6. **Database update**: The Reservation System updates the bookâ€™s status in the database to reflect that it's been reserved by the member, ensuring no other member can reserve it during this period.

7. **Reservation confirmation**: Upon successful reservation, the member is notified of the success through the Web Application interface. Additionally, the Reservation System triggers the Notification System.

8. **Notification dispatched**: The Notification System sends an email or SMS to the member, confirming the reservation and possibly providing details on when the book is expected to be available for pick-up.

This sequence ensures a straightforward, user-friendly process for library members wishing to reserve books, incorporating real-time updates and notifications to enhance the user experience.

Given the request for generating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the outlined user story, the following is a basic conceptual representation. This example focuses on the interaction process between a research support officer and the DMPTool, specifically addressing compliance with funders' rules and ensuring that all costs are accurately accounted for in the data management plan.

Note: Due to the versatile nature of PlantUML, there might be several ways to interpret and design these sequences, and the complexity of your actual system's architecture could necessitate additional layers of detail. Below is a simplified approach to get you started:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor "Research Support Officer" as officer
participant "DMPTool Interface" as DMPTool
database "Funders' Compliance Database" as ComplianceDB
participant "Cost Calculation Module" as CostModule
database "Project Costs Database" as CostsDB

== Ensure Compliance with Funders' Rules ==

officer -> DMPTool : Access DMPTool
activate DMPTool

DMPTool -> ComplianceDB : Retrieve funders' rules
activate ComplianceDB
ComplianceDB --> DMPTool : Return rules
deactivate ComplianceDB

DMPTool --> officer : Display funders' rules
officer -> DMPTool : Input project data details
activate officer

DMPTool -> CostModule : Estimate costs based on project data
activate CostModule
CostModule -> CostsDB : Query existing costs
activate CostsEntry
 
CostsDB --> CostModule : Return existing costs
CostModule -> CostsDB : Calculate additional project costs
CostsDB --> CostModule : Update costs
deactivate CostsEntry

CostModule --> DMPTool : Return calculated costs
deactivate CostModule

DMPTool -> ComplianceDB : Validate costs against funders' rules
activate ComplianceDB
ComplianceDB --> DMPTool : Costs compliance result
deactivate ComplianceDB

DMPTool --> officer : Display compliance status and detailed costs
deactivate DMPTool
deactivate officer

**Explanation:**
- The sequence diagram begins with the research support officer accessing the DMPTool interface.
- The DMPTool then retrieves the funders' rules from a compliance database, which are displayed to the officer.
- The officer inputs project data into the DMPTool, which then estimates the project costs via a cost calculation module.
- This module queries an existing costs database to retrieve any relevant costs and then calculates additional project costs, updating the database as necessary.
- The cost calculation module returns the calculated costs to the DMPTool, which then checks these costs against the funders' rules in the compliance database.
- Finally, the DMPTool displays the compliance status and detailed cost information to the research support officer, ensuring they can make informed decisions to adhere to funding requirements.

This diagram provides a simplified view of the sequence of interactions. Depending on the complexities of your system, you might need to expand it with more detailed interactions, error handling, external systems integration, or conditional flows.

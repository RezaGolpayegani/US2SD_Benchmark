Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story mentioned involves representing interactions between different system components and actors to fulfill the task of viewing medical forms by a camp administrator. Below is the PlantUML code that represents these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Camp Administrator" as Admin
participant "Camp Management\nPlatform" as Platform
database "Database" as DB

== View Medical Forms for Allergy Preparedness ==

Admin -> Platform: Request to view medical forms
activate Platform

Platform -> DB: Query medical forms
activate DB

DB --> Platform: Return medical forms
deactivate DB

Platform --> Admin: Display medical forms
deactivate Platform

Admin -> Platform: Select specific camper
activate Platform

Platform -> DB: Query camper medical form
activate DB

DB --> Platform: Return selected camper's medical form
deactivate DB

Platform --> Admin: Display selected camper's medical form
deactivate Platform

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Interaction Start**: The sequence begins with the Camp Administrator (Admin) requesting to view medical forms through the Camp Management Platform.
2. **Query for Medical Forms**: The Platform then queries the database for the medical forms its holds.
3. **Database Response**: The database returns the requested medical forms to the Platform.
4. **Display to Admin**: The Camp Management Platform displays the medical forms to the Admin.
5. **Further Interaction**: The Admin selects a specific camper to view detailed medical forms.
6. **Query for Specific Camper**: The Platform sends another query to the database, this time for a specific camper's medical form.
7. **Database Provides Camper's Form**: The database responds with the selected camper's medical form.
8. **Final Display**: The Camp Management Platform then displays this specific medical form to the Admin.

### Notes:
- The sequence assumes the "Camp Management Platform" acts as the primary interface for the Admin, handling both the display and data retrieval operations.
- "Database" symbolizes any data storage solution where camper records and medical forms are kept.
- The diagram illustrates a simplified process of interaction for clarity, focusing on the user story's core requirements.

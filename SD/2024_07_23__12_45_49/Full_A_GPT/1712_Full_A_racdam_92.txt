To depict the process described in the user story "As an archivist, I want to search individual material types" as a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, it is essential to consider the interaction between the archivist and the digital archive management system, particularly the search functionality. This sequence will detail steps from the archivist initiating a search for a specific material type to receiving the search results. Here's a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor Archivist as archivist
participant "Search Interface" as searchInt
database "Digital Archive\nManagement System" as DAMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Search Process ==
archivist -> searchInt : enters search query\n(material type)
searchInt -> DAMS : process query
DAMS -> DB : retrieve records\n(material type)
DB --> DAMS : records
DAMS --> searchInt : search results
searchInt --> archivist : display results

@enduml
```

In the diagram, the process initiates with the Archivist entering a search query for a specific material type into the Search Interface. The query is then processed by the Digital Archive Management System (DAMS), which interacts with the Database to retrieve relevant records based on the material type specified. Finally, the results are sent back to the Archivist through the Search Interface.

This is a basic depiction and might need adjustments based on specific functionalities or steps within the system, like search optimization, handling of access permissions, and so forth. Depending on the complexity of the archive system and the requirements, further refinements or additional steps might be necessary to accurately represent the search process.

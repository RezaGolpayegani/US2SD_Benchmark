Creating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format that reflects the user story of a Development Staff member issuing a Development-related Permit involves outlining the interactions between the system components such as the User Interface (UI), the Application Backend, the Database, and the Applicant. This diagram will demonstrate the flow from the moment a Development Staff member decides to issue a permit based on a valid application, through to the Database updates and the notification sent to the Applicant about the issuance of the permit.

Please note, to execute this PlantUML code, you would need a PlantUML environment set up or use an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme cerulean

actor "Development Staff" as Staff
participant ":UI/Application\nPortal" as UI
participant ":Backend\nService" as Backend
participant ":Database" as DB
actor "Applicant" as Applicant

== Issue Development-related Permit ==

Staff -> UI: Log in
UI -> Backend: Auth request
Backend -> DB: Validate Staff credentials
DB -> Backend: Credentials valid
Backend -> UI: Auth successful
UI -> Staff: Access Granted

activate Staff

Staff -> UI: Select Application to Review
UI -> Backend: Locate Application
Backend -> DB: Query Application Details
DB -> Backend: Return Application Details
Backend -> UI: Show Application Details
UI -> Administrator: Display Application

note right of Staff: Review Application Details\nand Compliance

Staff -> UI: Issue Development Permit

UI -> Backend: Process Permit Issuance
Backend -> DB: Update Permit Status\n+Generate Permit
DB -> Backend: Confirm Permit Issued
Backend -> UI: Permit Issuance Successful
UI -> Staff: Notify Permit Issued

deactivate Staff

Backend -> DB: Log Activity
DB -> Backend: Log Confirmed

Backend -> UI: Send Notification to Applicant
UI -> Applicant: Notify Permit Issued

note over Applicant: Applicant Receives\nPermit Issuance Notification

Explanation of Sequence Diagram Steps:
1. The Development Staff logs in through the UI/Application Portal, which sends an authentication request to the Backend Service. The Backend then validates the credentials with the Database.
2. Once authentication is successful and access is granted, the Staff selects the permit application to review from the UI.
3. The UI requests the Backend to locate the application, which queries the Database for application details. These details are returned to the Backend, then shown to the Staff through the UI.
4. The Staff reviews the application details and decides to issue the development permit through the UI.
5. The UI communicates this decision to the Backend, which proceeds to update the permit status in the Database and generates the permit. The Database confirms that the permit is issued.
6. The Backend then logs the activity of permit issuance in the Database.
7. Finally, the Backend instructs the UI to send a notification to the Applicant, informing them that the permit has been issued.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in issuing a development-related permit within the County Services & Property Information Portal from the perspective of Development Staff.

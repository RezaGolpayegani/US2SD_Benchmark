Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the interactive process between different system components when an archivist searches for images by the place they were taken. We will create this diagram using PlantUML language, which might include components like the User Interface (UI), Search Controller, Database, and possibly a third-party API if the location-based search utilizes external services for place information.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "UI" as UI
participant "Search Controller" as SC
database "Database" as DB

A -> UI : Enter search query (Place Name)
UI -> SC : Send search request
SC -> DB : Query images by place
DB --> SC : Return image results
SC --> UI : Display search results
UI --> A : Show images taken at specified Place

@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Archivist (A)**: This actor initiates the search process by entering a place name or location in the search box on the User Interface (UI).
2. **UI (User Interface)**: Acts as the intermediary for input and output between the Archivist and the system. It collects the search query from the Archivist and displays the search results back to them.
3. **Search Controller (SC)**: Receives the search request from the UI and communicates with the Database (DB) to retrieve the pertinent images. This component may also handle any necessary logic for interpreting the place name, possibly interfacing with a geographical location system or a third-party API if the system incorporates external services to enhance location-based search capabilities (not explicitly mentioned in this sequence but a possible enhancement).
4. **Database (DB)**: Stores the digital archival collections, including metadata about the images, such as the place where each photo was taken. The query for images by place is executed here, and the relevant image data is returned to the Search Controller.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the process involved in searching for images by the place they were taken in the digital archive system. The detailed implementation may require additional steps or components, such as error handling, authentication and authorization checks (especially for accessing restricted images), and integrating with external map or location services for advanced place name interpretation and search accuracy.

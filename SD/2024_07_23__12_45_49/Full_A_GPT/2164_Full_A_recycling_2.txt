Given your user story requirement, I'll create a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format. This diagram will outline the process flow for a user who wants to anonymously view public information about recycling centers. Please note, as detailed specifications such as server or database architecture are not provided, the sequence will focus on the assumed key interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant User
participant "RecycleSmart Web Interface" as WebInterface
participant "RecycleSmart Server" as Server
database "Recycling Centers DB" as Database

User -> WebInterface : Access RecycleSmart
WebInterface -> Server : Request anon access to view recycling centers
Server -> Database : Query public info on recycling centers
Database --> Server : Return recycling center data
Server --> WebInteractive : Display recycling centers info
WebInterface --> User : Show list of nearby recycling centers

```

This sequence diagram represents the following steps within the specified user story:

1. **User**: The person interacts with the RecycleSmart web interface, seeking to find information about nearby recycling centers without having to sign in or create an account.
2. **RecycleSmart Web Interface**: This component is the front-end through which the user interacts with the RecycleSmart platform.
3. **RecycleSmart Server**: Acts as the middleware that processes the request. Here, it handles the anonymous request for information on recycling centers.
4. **Recycling Centers Database**: Contains detailed data on recycling centers, such as locations, types of recyclable materials accepted, and operating hours.
5. **Process Flow**:
    - The user accesses the RecycleSmart Web Interface.
    - The Web Interface sends a request to the Server to allow anonymous access for viewing public information about recycling centers.
    - The Server queries the Recycling Centers Database for the public information.
    - The Database returns the data for recycling centers to the Server.
    - The Server passes this information back to the Web Interface.
    - The Web Interface displays the recycling centers' information to the User, including locations, types of recyclables accepted, and possibly, operating hours.

This simplified flow describes the anonymous user's interaction with the RecycleSmart platform to view information about recycling centers. The diagram assumes that the platform allows for this functionality without requiring user authentication for accessing public data.

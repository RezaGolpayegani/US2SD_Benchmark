To accomplish the task of generating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story using PlantUML, we follow a series of interactions between the User (Researcher), the User Interface (UI), the System (Neurohub Platform), and potentially other subsystems like the Database and an External Data Visualization Tool. This scenario illustrates the process of requesting and displaying a timeline of multiple data files and their associated images for comparison.

Given the complexity of such interactions, the diagram focuses on key components and processes to fulfill the user story's requirements. The narrative assumes that the Neurohub platform has integrated capabilities for data visualization.

Here is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram illustrating the interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as R
participant "UI - Neurohub" as UI
participant "System - Neurohub" as Sys
participant Database as DB
participant "Data Visualization\nTool" as DV

R -> UI : Requests data timeline\nfor specific experiments
UI -> Sys : Validate request\n(User authenticated?)
activate Sys
Sys -> DB : Query metadata for\nrequested experiments
activate DB
DB --> Sys : Return metadata,\nfile paths
deactivate DB

Sys -> Sys : Organize data by date
Sys -> DV : Prepare visualization data
activate DV
DV --> Sys : Generate timeline visualization
deactivate DV

Sys --> UI : Send timeline data
UI --> R : Display experiment data timeline
deactivate Sys

This diagram outlines the following steps:

1. **Researcher Requests**: The researcher requests a timeline display of multiple data files and their associated images through the Neurohub UI.
2. **System Validation**: The Neurohub system validates the request, ensuring the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested data.
3. **Query Database**: The system queries the database for metadata corresponding to the requested experimental data files.
4. **Organize Data**: The system organizes the retrieved data by date, preparing it for visualization.
5. **Prepare Visualization Data**: The system prepares the data in a format compatible with the Data Visualization Tool.
6. **Generate Timeline Visualization**: The Data Visualization Tool generates the timeline visualization based on the prepared data.
7. **Display Timeline**: The generated timeline is sent back to the UI, which then displays it to the researcher.

This scenario emphasizes the importance of system integration and data management within the Neurohub Enhancement and Automation Project, particularly for features enabling efficient data visualization and comparison.

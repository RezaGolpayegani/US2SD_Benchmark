Creating a sequence diagram for the user story provided involves outlining the interactions between various entities (such as the NSF employee, project manager, designers, developers, and the content management system (CMS) selection team) through a series of steps to achieve the final workshop goal. This diagram will illustrate the flow of actions triggered by the NSF employee's desire to consolidate key lessons and features for deciding on a content management system through a final workshop.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet reflecting these interactions as they might occur within the context of the described project. To visualize this diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML environment (such as an online editor or a local setup with Graphviz installed).

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "NSF Employee" as Employee
participant "Project Manager" as PM
participant "Design Team" as Design
participant "Development Team" as Dev
participant "CMS Selection Team" as CMSTeam
participant "Final Workshop" as Workshop

== Preparation Phase ==
Employee -> PM: Request for final workshop
PM -> Design: Gather design lessons
Design -> PM: Design insights
PM -> Dev: Gather development lessons
Dev -> PM: Development insights
PM -> CMSTeam: Request for CMS feature summary
CMSTeam -> PM: Summary of CMS requirements

== Consolidation Phase ==
PM -> Workshop: Schedule and prepare agenda
PM -> Workshop: Consolidate all insights and requirements

== Workshop Execution ==
PM -> Workshop: Host workshop
Workshop -> Employee: Provide overview of project
Workshop -> Design: Share key design lessons
Workshop -> Dev: Share key development insights
Workshop -> CMSTeam: Discuss CMS requirements and features
CMSTeam -> Workshop: Identify essential CMS features
Workshop -> Employee: Involve in discussion and feedback

== Post-Workroom Action ==
Employee -> PM: Validate and agree on CMS decision criteria
PM -> CMSTeam: Finalize CMS selection based on workshop
CMSTeam -> PM: Confirm final CMS choice
PM -> Employee: Communicate final CMS decision and next steps

This PlantUML diagram starts with the NSF employee's request to the project manager for a final workshop aimed at identifying key lessons and CMS features. The project manager then coordinates with the design team, development team, and CMS selection team to gather necessary insights and requirements. These preparations lead to the execution phase of the workshop, where discussions are had, and feedback is collected. Finally, post-workshop actions ensure the CMS decision criteria are validated, leading to the final CMS selection.

Please note that this sequence diagram is a high-level representation. Depending on your specific requirements or details, you might need to adjust or elaborate on the interactions between the participants.

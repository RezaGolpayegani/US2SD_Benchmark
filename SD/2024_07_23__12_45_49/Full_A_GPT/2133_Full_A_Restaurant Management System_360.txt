To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to see my clock-in time reports" using PlantUML format, we need to outline the interaction between the employee and the system components involved in retrieving clock-in time reports. Below is a simplified version that assumes the existence of a front-end application where employees interact with the system, a back-end server, and a database where clock-in records are stored.

```
@startuml
participant Employee as E
participant FrontEndApplication as FE
participant BackEndServer as BE
participant Database as DB

title Employee Clock-In Time Reports Sequence

E -> FE: Request to view clock-in time reports
FE -> BE: GET /api/clockintimes
activate BE
BE -> DB: Query clock-in records for employee
activate DB
DB --> BE: Return clock-in records
deactivate DB
BE --> FE: Clock-in data response
deactivate BE
FE --> E: Display clock-in time reports
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Employee requesting to view their clock-in time reports through the front-end application. The front-end then sends a request to the back-end server, specifically to an endpoint that could resemble `/api/clockintimes.` The back-end server processes the request by querying the database for the clock-in records associated with that employee. Once the database returns the clock-in records, the back-end server formats this data, if necessary, and sends it back to the front-end application. Finally, the front-end application displays the clock-in time reports to the employee.

Please remember, this is a simplified version. The actual implementation can vary based on the system design, such as how authentication and authorization are handled, the structure of the database, and the specifics of how clock-in time data is stored and retrieved. Also, the system might involve more detailed interactions, such as error handling, data caching, or additional middleware services, which are not depicted in this straightforward sequence diagram.

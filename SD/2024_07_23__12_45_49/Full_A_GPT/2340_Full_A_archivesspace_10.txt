Given the user story and project description, below is a simplified PlantUML sequence diagram concept that demonstrates how an Archivist might encounter and understand an error during the import process in the Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement project. 

```
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant "Import Service" as Import
participant "Data Validator" as Validator
participant "Error Logging Service" as Logger
participant "Notification Service" as Notifier

Archivist -> Import : Initiate Import (EAD, CSV, MARCXML, EAC-CPF)
activate Import

Import -> Validator : Validate Data Format and Integrity
activate Validator

alt Validation Failed
    Validator -> Logger : Log Error Details
    activate Logger
    Logger --> Validator : Log ID
    deactivate Logger
    
    Validator -> Notifier : Trigger Error Notification(Log ID)
    deactivate Validator
    activate Notifier
    Notifier -> Archivist : Display Error and Suggestion
    deactivate Notifier
else Validation Successful
    Validator --> Import : Proceed with Data Import
    deactivate Validator
    
    Import -> Import : Import Data to System
    Import -> Archivist : Show Success Message
end

deactivate Import
@enduml
```

This diagram begins with the Archivist initiating an import process by sending data to the Import Service. The Import Service then requests a Data Validation from the Data Validator component. Based on the validation result, there are two possible outcomes:

1. **Validation Failed**: If data doesn't comply with the expected format or integrity checks fail, the Data Validator instructs the Error Logging Service to log the error details. The Logging Service returns a Log ID, which the Validator uses to inform the Notification Service. This service then communicates the error and possible reasons directly to the Archivist, helping them understand what went wrong.

2. **Validation Successful**: If the validation passes, the process proceeds with the Data Import to the system and eventually informs the Archivist of the successful operation.

This sequence ensures that in case of an error during the import process, the Archivist is duly notified and understands the nature of the error, aligning with the user story's requirements. Note that for real-life implementations, the diagram and process might be significantly more complex and could potentially involve more systems and interactions, especially concerning data integrity, user authentication, and detailed error handling mechanisms.

To represent the user story of a staff member wanting to display member profiles for reviewing member records in a sequence diagram, we will outline the interactions between various components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Given the complexity and the multiple steps involved in this operation, the PlantUML code provided below describes the sequential flow starting from the staff's action to initiate the display of a member profile, interaction with the web interface, processing by the backend, querying the database, and finally presenting the information back to the staff member.

Please note that this representation assumes a simplified view of the system for the sake of clarity and focus on the user story mentioned. The actual implementation might involve additional steps or components based on security, data validation, and user experience considerations.

```plantuml

UI -> SV : Fetch Member Profile(ID)

SV -> DB : Query Member(ID)
activate DB

DB --> SV : Return Member Data
deactivate DB

SV --> UI : Display Member Data

UI --> S : Show Member Profile Info

### Explanation:

1. **Staff (S) to WebInterface (UI):** The sequence begins with the staff member initiating a request to view a member's profile through the Web Interface (UI) of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). The staff would typically do this by providing a member's ID or selecting a member's profile from a list of members.

2. **WebInterface (UI) to Server (SV):** The Web Interface then sends a request to the backend server to fetch the profile information for the specified member. This request includes the member's ID or other identifying information necessary to retrieve the correct profile.

3. **Server (SV) to Database (DB):** Upon receiving the request, the server queries the Database to retrieve the requested member's data. This interaction typically involves looking up the member's record in the member profiles table or collection based on the supplied ID.

4. **Database (DB) to Server (SV):** The Database returns the queried member data to the Server. This data may include various pieces of information about the member, such as name, contact details, membership status, borrowing history, and any other relevant records.

5. **Server (SV) to WebInterface (UI):** The Server processes the received data as required (e.g., formatting it for display) and sends it back to the Web Interface.

6. **WebInterface (UI) to Staff (S):** Finally, the Web Interface presents the member's profile information to the staff member. This could be displayed in a detailed profile view page that allows the staff to review all pertinent information about the member.

This sequence diagram effectively outlines the interactions and flow of data within the CLMS for displaying a member profile to a staff member. It can serve as a blueprint for implementing this functionality in the system.

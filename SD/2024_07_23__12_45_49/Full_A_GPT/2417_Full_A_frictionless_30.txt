Certainly! To generate a Detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the described User Story, we first outline the key activities and interactions that might occur between the Researcher/Government Publisher and the various components of the DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer (DPIE) system. Here is a narrative for reference:

1. The researcher prepares the dataset containing geographic data.
2. The researcher initiates a request to DPIE to map lines based on the dataset.
3. DPIE validates the dataset format and integrity.
4. DPIE retrieves geospatial mapping tools or resources.
5. The system integrates geographic data from the dataset to create a map with lines.
6. DPIE enhances the dataset with the newly created map visualization.
7. The enriched dataset is presented back to the researcher, now ready for sharing with non-technical users.

Based on this narrative, hereâ€™s how a PlantUML sequence diagram could look like:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as "Researcher/Government Publisher"
participant "DPIE System" as DPIE
participant "Data Validator" as Validator
participant "Mapping Tool" as Mapper
participant "Data Enhancer" as Enhancer

Researcher -> DPIE: Request map lines creation from dataset
activate DPIE

DPIE -> Validator: Validate dataset format and integrity
activate Validator
Validator --> DPIE: Validation Success
deactivate Validator

DPIE -> Mapper: Retrieve mapping tools/resources
activate Mapper
Mapper --> DPIE: Mapping tools provided
deactivate Mapper

DPIE -> Mapper: Create map with lines from dataset
activate Mapper
Mapper --> DPIE: Map creation successful
deactivate Mapper

DPIE -> Enhancer: Enhance dataset with map visualization
activate Enhancer
Enhancer --> DPIE: Dataset enhancement successful
deactivate Enhancer

DPIE -> Researcher: Return enhanced dataset with maps
deactivate DPIE

This PlantUML code outlines the sequence of interactions based on the given user story. To visualize this diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or an online PlantUML editor. This diagram is a simplified representation to fit the given user story's context within the broader functionality of the DPIE project. Depending on the complexity of the DPIE system and the specifics of the geospatial mapping requirement, further details and components could be added to the sequence diagram.

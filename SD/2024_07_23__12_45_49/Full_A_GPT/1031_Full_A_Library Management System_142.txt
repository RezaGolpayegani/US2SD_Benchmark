Given the user story of interest from the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) project, a sequence diagram that outlines the process of a library member clicking into a book to get more information about that title can be generated using PlantUML syntax. Below is an example of a sequence diagram fulfilling this requirement.

Please note, this example assumes a basic flow where the user interacts with a web-based interface, which then communicates with a backend system to retrieve book details from a database. Additional or alternative steps might be necessary depending on the specific architectural and design choices made during the actual development of the CLMS system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as member
participant "UI Interface" as ui
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Library Database" as db

member -> ui : Clicks on a book title
ui -> backend : Request book details (bookID)
backend -> db : Query book details (bookID)
db -> backend : Return book details
backend -> ui : Book details response
ui -> member : Display book information

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Steps:
1. **Member Interaction:** The sequence starts with the library member (user) clicking on a book title in the UI (User Interface) to view more details about it.
   
2. **UI to Backend Request:** The UI interface captures this action and sends a request to the backend system. This request includes the identification of the book (bookID) whose details are being requested.

3. **Backend System Processing:** Upon receiving the request, the backend system queries the Library Database for the details of the requested book using the bookID.

4. **Database Query:** The Library Database processes the query and returns the details of the book back to the backend system. This can include information like the book's title, author, publication date, summary, availability status, and any other relevant details stored in the database.

5. **Response to UI:** The backend system processes the received information and sends a structured response back to the UI interface.

6. **Display to User:** Finally, the UI interface presents the book details to the member in a readable and interactive format. This completes the process of a library member clicking into a book to get more information on that item.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions involved in fetching and displaying book details to a library member within the CLMS. Actual implementation details might introduce additional complexities such as error handling, authentication, and more detailed data processing steps.

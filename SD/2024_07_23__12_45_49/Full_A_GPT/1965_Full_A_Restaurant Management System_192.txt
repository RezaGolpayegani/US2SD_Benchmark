To generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to see the ingredient storage so that I can know which products are not available" using PlantUML, we need to outline the interactions between the system's components from the manager's request to the display of the ingredient storage status.

Please note, the specific details of method names and class structures may vary depending on the actual implementation of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. The following is a simplified illustration that serves to demonstrate the sequence of events.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "Manager Interface" as managerInterface
participant "Backend Server" as backend
participant "Database" as db

manager -> managerInterface : requestIngredientStorageStatus()
managerInterface -> backend : getIngredientStorageStatus()
backend -> db : queryUnavailableProducts()
db -> backend : returnUnavailableProductsList()
backend -> managerInterface : showUnavailableProducts(unavailableProducts)
managerInterface -> manager : displayUnavailableProductsList()

@enduml
```

Explanation of the sequence:
- **Manager**: Initiates the action by requesting to see the ingredient storage status, specifically looking for products that are not available.
- **Manager Interface**: The front-end interface through which the manager interacts. It relays the request to the backend server to fetch the required data.
- **Backend Server**: Processes the request by querying the database for information on ingredient availability.
- **Database**: Holds the data related to ingredient storage and returns a list of unavailable products upon query.
- **Flow**: The information flows from the database back to the backend server, which processes and sends it to the manager interface; finally, the list of unavailable products is displayed to the manager.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the components involved and the interactions for fulfilling the manager's request. Adjustments may be required based on the specific technologies and architecture used in the project.

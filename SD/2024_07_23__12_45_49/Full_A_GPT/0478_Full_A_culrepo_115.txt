Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format involves illustrating how various system components interact with each other to achieve the functionality of uploading a new version of an item while keeping the old versions accessible. Here's a basic PlantUML sequence diagram to represent this process.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Data Curator" as curator
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
database "Repository System" as repo
participant "Versioning Controller" as versioning
participant "Metadata Management" as metadata
participant "Preservation System" as preservation

curator -> web : Request to upload new version
web -> auth : Validate curator credentials
auth -> web : Credentials valid

alt If new item
    web -> repo : Check item exists
    repo -> web : Item does not exist
    web -> curator : Show error message
else If updating existing item
    web -> repo : Check item exists
    repo -> web : Item exists
    web -> versioning : Create new version
    versioning -> metadata : Update metadata with new version info
    metadata -> preservation : Preserve old version
    preservation -> versioning : Confirmation of old version preserved
    versioning -> repo : Save new version
    repo -> web : New version uploaded successfully
    web -> curator : Show success message
end

### Explanation:
1. **Data Curator starts the process:** The Data Curator initiates the upload process for a new version of an item through the Web Interface.
2. **Authentication:** The Web Interface requests the Authentication Service to validate the curator's credentials to ensure that only authorized personnel can upload new versions.
3. **Check if item exists:** Before uploading a new version, the system checks if the item already exists in the Repository System.
4. **Version control flow:**
   - If the item does not exist, an error message is shown to the Curator.
   - If the item exists, the system proceeds with creating a new version.
5. **Creating a new version:**
   - The Versioning Controller handles the creation of a new version. It interacts with Metadata Management to update the item's metadata with information about the new version.
   - The old version of the item is preserved by the Preservation System. Confirmation that the old version has been securely stored is sent back to the Versioning Controller.
   - The new version of the item is saved in the Repository System, and a success message is displayed to the Curator.

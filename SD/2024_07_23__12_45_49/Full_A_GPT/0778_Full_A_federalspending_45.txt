Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story—updating SQL codes for clarity—requires mapping out the interaction between the broker team member and the system components involved. Here's a PlantUML code snippet that could represent this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant BrokerMember as "Broker Team Member"
participant IDE as "Integrated Development Environment"
participant VersionControl as "Version Control System"
participant BuildServer as "Build Server"
participant Testing as "Automated Testing System"
participant Deployment as "Deployment System"
participant DataBase as "Database"

BrokerMember -> IDE : Update SQL codes for clarity
IDE -> VersionControl : Commit updated SQL
VersionControl -> BuildServer : Trigger new build
BuildServer -> Testing : Run SQL unit tests
Testing --> BuildServer : Report test results
alt Successful Test
  BuildServer -> Deployment : Deploy updates to staging
  Deployment -> DataBase : Apply SQL updates
  DataBase --> Deployment : Confirm successful update
  Deployment --> BrokerMember : Notify update success
else Test Failure
  Testing --> BrokerMember : Report failure details
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Broker Team Member updating the SQL codes for clarity within their Integrated Development Environment (IDE). After making these updates, the changes are committed to a Version Control System (e.g., Git). The new commit triggers a build in the Build Server, which subsequently runs automated SQL unit tests. Depending on the outcome of these tests:

- If successful, the Build Server instructs the Deployment System to deploy these updates to a staging environment, where the updated SQL is applied to the Database. The Database confirms the successful update back to the Deployment System, which in turn notifies the Broker Team Member of the success.
- If the tests fail, the Automated Testing System reports the failure details back to the Broker Team Member for further action.

This diagram provides a high-level overview and could be further detailed by breaking down complex steps, adding more systems interactions, or detailing specific commands and actions taken at each step.

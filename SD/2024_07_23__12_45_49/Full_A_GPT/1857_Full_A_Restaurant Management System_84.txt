Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a management user, I want to see the arrival and simple departure times of the employees" requires identifying the key components and interactions within the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This encompasses interactions between the management user, the system's backend server, the database, and possibly other services involved in tracking employee time attendance.

Below is a simplified PlantUML code that outlines the sequence of actions a management user might take to retrieve employee attendance times, and how the system processes that request.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Management User" as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

user -> web : Access employee attendance section
web -> server : Request attendance data
activate server

server -> db : Query employee arrival and departure times
activate db
db --> server : Return attendance data
deactivate db

server --> web : Display attendance data
web --> user : Show attendance times on UI
deactivate server

@enduml
```

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram

1. **Management User Interaction**: The management user accesses the employee attendance section through the user interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

2. **Request for Attendance Data**: The web interface sends a request to the backend server to fetch the attendance data, including arrival and departure times of employees.

3. **Querying the Database**: The backend server, upon receiving the request, queries the system's database for the specified attendance data. This involves fetching records of employee check-ins and check-outs.

4. **Returning Data to Server**: The database processes the query and returns the relevant attendance data back to the backend server.

5. **Displaying Data**: The backend server then sends this data to the web interface, which formats and displays the attendance times to the management user.

6. **User Interaction Completed**: The management user reviews the arrival and departure times of employees as displayed on the user interface.

This sequence diagram is a high-level overview and can be expanded to include error handling, authentication and authorization steps, and more detailed interactions based on the specific requirements of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. The technologies mentioned (e.g., React.js, Node.js, MongoDB/PostgreSQL) provide the framework for developing these functionalities.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As a manager, I want to see the order wait time of customers' reports," involves illustrating the interactions between the Manager, the Restaurant Management System, and the Database. Given the complexity and the specifics of your project, below is a generic representation of how this could be structured in PlantUML format. This example assumes the manager interacts with a web interface (UI), which in turn queries the backend system to fetch the required data from the database.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as M
participant "UI Dashboard" as UI
participant "Backend Server" as B
database "Database" as DB

M -> UI : Select "Order Wait Time Report"
UI -> B : Request order wait time data
activate B
B -> DB : Query order wait times
activate DB
DB --> B : Return order wait times
deactivate DB
B --> UI : Process data for visualization
UI --> M : Display order wait time report
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the manager selecting to view the "Order Wait Time Report" on the UI Dashboard. The UI then requests this information from the Backend Server (`Backend Server`), which, in turn, queries the `Database` for order wait times. The Database returns the raw data to the Backend Server, which processes it (possibly aggregates, sorts, or filters) to better fit the visualization needs of the dashboard. Finally, the processed data is sent back to the UI Dashboard, which displays the report to the manager.

This diagram is simplistic and focuses on the high-level interaction between components. Practical implementations may have more layers and interactions, especially if there are authentication steps, error handling, or interactions with third-party services for analytics. Additionally, the technology stack mentioned (React.js or Angular, Node.js with Express, MongoDB or PostgreSQL, AWS or Google Cloud) should be taken into consideration when fleshing out the actual code and infrastructure specifics, as different stacks might lead to slightly different interactions or additional steps in processing the requests.

The following is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the described user story. This diagram assumes the interaction between the user (researcher), a Web UI (User Interface), and the backend systems responsible for handling metadata templates and data insertion within the Neurohub platform.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Researcher as user
participant "Web UI" as web
participant "Template Manager" as tempMgr
participant "Data Management System" as dataMgr

user -> web : Select to add new data
web -> tempMgr : Request available templates
tempMgr -> tempMgr : Fetch templates
tempMgr -> web : Return templates
web -> user : Display templates with common metadata
user -> web : Select preferred template\nand add/update data
web -> tempMgr : Get selected template metadata
tempMgr -> web : Return metadata
web -> dataMgr : Insert new data with template metadata
dataMgr -> dataMgr : Validate and store data
dataMgr -> web : Confirm data addition
web -> user : Display success message

This sequence diagram outlines the process from a researcher's perspective of adding new data to the Neurohub platform using a partially pre-populated template. The steps detailed are as follows:

1. The researcher initiates the process to add new data through the Web UI.
2. The Web UI requests a list of available templates from the Template Manager.
3. The Template Manager retrieves the templates from its storage and returns them to the Web UI.
4. The Web UI presents these templates to the researcher, showcasing those that contain commonly entered metadata.
5. The researcher selects their preferred template and adds or updates data as needed.
6. The Web UI requests the metadata associated with the selected template from the Template Manager.
7. The Template Manager returns the necessary metadata to the Web UI.
8. The Web UI then sends the new data along with the pre-populated metadata to the Data Management System for insertion.
9. The Data Management System verifies the information and stores the data.
10. Upon successful storage, the Data Management System informs the Web UI, which in turn notifies the researcher of the successful data addition.

This workflow enhances the user experience by streamlining the process of adding new data with common metadata, thus saving time and reducing repetitive tasks for researchers.

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the Admin and the platformâ€™s components necessary to manage pricing plans and the billing system. It includes creating, updating, and deleting pricing plans, viewing billing system details, handling invoice generation, adjusting invoices manually, and analyzing the performance of pricing plans. This diagram provides a simplified view of the process, and actual implementations might involve more detailed interactions based on specific business rules and software design.

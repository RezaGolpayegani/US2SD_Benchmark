To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the described user story in PlantUML format, you'd outline the flow and interaction between the user, UI components, and the backend services involved in hiding a dataset. Hereâ€™s an example sequence diagram for your requirement:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Publishing User" as user
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Validation Service" as validation
participant "Dataset Management Service" as management
database "OpenSpending Database" as db

== Hide a Public Dataset ==

user -> web : Request to hide a dataset
web -> validation : Validate user permissions
activate validation
validation --> web : Permission Granted
deactivate validation

web -> management : Hide dataset command (dataset ID)
activate management
management -> db : Update dataset visibility (Hidden)
activate db
db --> management : Dataset visibility updated
deactivate db
management --> web : Dataset hidden successfully
deactivate management
web --> user : Display success message

@enduml
```

This diagram illustrates the process from the user intending to hide a public dataset up until the operation's success confirmation, following these steps:

1. **User Action**: The data publishing user initiates the request to hide a dataset via the web interface, aiming to fix mistakes or use the dataset privately.

2. **Validation**: The system validates the user's permissions to ensure they have the right to alter the dataset's visibility.

3. **Command Processing**: Upon successful validation, the command to hide the dataset is sent to the dataset management service.

4. **Database Update**: The dataset management service communicates with the database to update the dataset's visibility to 'Hidden'.

5. **Confirmation**: The user receives a success message, indicating that the dataset is now hidden and not publicly visible.

This sequence ensures secure and user-intended modification of dataset visibility, fulfilling the user story requirements.

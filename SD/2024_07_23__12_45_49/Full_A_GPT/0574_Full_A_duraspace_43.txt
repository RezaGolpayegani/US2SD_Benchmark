Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story specified requires breaking down the interaction into discrete steps that include the user's action, the system's response, and any intermediate processes. Given the scope of the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS), the process to indicate if a statute pertains to the component, apart from the object as a whole, involves various actors and system components. 

Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents a sequence diagram for the aforementioned user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DIMS Interface" as UI
participant "Rights Management Component" as Rights
participant "Database" as DB

RM -> UI: Access component management
activate UI

UI -> Rights: Retrieve component details
activate Rights

Rights -> DB: Query component information
activate DB

DB --> Rights: Return component details
deactivate DB

Rights --> UI: Show component rights management options
deactivate Rights

RM -> UI: Indicate statute pertaining to component
activate UI

UI -> Rights: Update component rights with statute
activate Rights

Rights -> DB: Save statute information for component
activate DB

DB --> Rights: Confirm save
deactivate DB

Rights --> UI: Display save confirmation
deactivate Rights

UI --> RM: Confirm statute indication
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

To utilize this PlantUML code:

1. Copy the code snippet.
2. Use a PlantUML editor or an online tool that supports PlantUML to paste this code snippet.
3. Generate the diagram.

This diagram details the interaction flow starting from the repository manager wanting to indicate if a statute pertains to a component and not just the object as a whole. It involves navigating the DIMS interface, retrieving and updating component rights information, and finally, the repository manager receiving confirmation that the statute has been associated with the specific component within the DAMS environment.

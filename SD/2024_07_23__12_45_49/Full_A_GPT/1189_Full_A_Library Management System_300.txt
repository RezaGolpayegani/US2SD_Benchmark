To visualize the interaction for a library member who wants to see the library opening and closing hours, we'll create a Sequence Diagram using PlantUML. The process involves the member accessing the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), navigating through the system to find the library information, and then displaying the opening and closing hours.

Here's a detailed Sequence Diagram for this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant WebInterface as W
participant Server as S
participant Database as D

M -> W: Access CLMS
activate W

W -> S: Request to load library information page
activate S

S -> D: Query library hours
activate D

D --> S: Return library hours data
deactivate D

S --> W: Display library hours
deactivate S

W --> M: Show library opening and closing hours
deactivate W

@enduml
```

### Explanation:

1. **Member (M) to WebInterface (W):** 
   - The member accesses the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) through its web interface. This could be via a desktop, laptop, or mobile device.

2. **WebInterface (W) to Server (S):**
   - Once the member tries to find the library opening and closing hours, the web interface sends a request to the server to load the library information page where such details are displayed.

3. **Server (S) to Database (D):**
   - The server, upon receiving the request, queries the database for the library's opening and closing hours. The database holds all the relevant details about the library's operation times.

4. **Database (D) to Server (S):**
   - The database returns the queried information back to the server. This information includes the precise opening and closing hours of the library.

5. **Server (S) to WebInterface (W):**
   - With the information retrieved from the database, the server processes it and sends it to the web interface to display the information to the member.

6. **WebInterface (W) to Member (M):**
   - Finally, the member is presented with the library's opening and closing hours through the web interface, completing the interaction loop.

This Sequence Diagram outlines the flow of information and interaction between different components of the system for the given user story.

Given your request, below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram describing the steps involved in a Cornell faculty member assigning a Creative Commons (CC) license to the files they are depositing in the digital repository system.

Please note, PlantUML code is designed to be converted into a diagram using a PlantUML processor or compatible tool, such as an online PlantUML editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) plugin that supports PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as "Faculty Member"
participant "Upload Interface" as UI
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "License Management" as LM
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Repository Interface" as RI

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:
1. **Faculty Member Selects Files for Upload:** The faculty member begins the process by choosing the files they wish to deposit into the repository through the upload interface.

2. **Upload Interface to Content Management System:** The selected files are handed over from the upload interface to the core content management system for further processing.

3. **Content Management System Prompts License Selection:** Before finalizing the upload, the content management system interacts with the license management component to prompt the faculty member to select an appropriate license for the material.

4. **Faculty Member Assigns CC License:** The faculty member selects a Creative Commons license for their files, indicating how other users can use the deposited materials.

5. **License Management Updates Database:** Once a CC license is selected, this choice is recorded in the repository's database, updating the file's metadata with the licensing information.

6. **Database Confirms Metadata Update:** The database acknowledges the successful update of the file metadata, incorporating the CC license information.

7. **Content Is Displayed with CC License:** Finally, the repository interface reflects that the files have been uploaded with the specified Creative Commons license, making this information visible to users accessing the file.

This diagram portrays a simplified sequence focusing on the specific user story of a faculty member assigning a CC license during the file deposit process in the digital repository system. Remember, actual implementation details may vary and could require additional steps or involve different system components.

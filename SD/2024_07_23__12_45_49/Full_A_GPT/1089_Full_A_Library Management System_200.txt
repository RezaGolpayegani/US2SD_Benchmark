To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a manager, I want to update library members" using PlantUML, we need to outline the steps involved in the process and the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). 

Please note that to run PlantUML diagrams, you'll need a PlantUML environment or an online service that can interpret and display PlantUML code. 

Hereâ€™s a PlantUML sequence diagram detailing the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Database" as DB

== Update Library Member ==
manager -> UI: Chooses to update a member's profile
UI -> Auth: Validate Manager Credentials
Auth -> UI: Credentials Validated

UI -> manager: Show member update form

manager -> UI: Enters updated member details\n(subscription plan, personal info, etc.)

UI -> DB: Update Member Details in DB
DB -> UI: Confirm Member Updated

UI -> manager: Display Member Successfully Updated Message

### Explanation:
1. **Manager Chooses to Update a Member's Profile:** The sequence starts with the manager deciding to update the profile of a library member. This action is initiated through the user interface (UI) of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

2. **Validation of Manager Credentials:** The UI then sends a request to the Authentication Service to validate the manager's credentials to ensure that they have the necessary permissions to update member details.

3. **Credentials Validated:** Upon successful validation, the authentication service confirms that the credentials are valid.

4. **Show Member Update Form:** The UI presents the manager with a form or interface to update the member's details. This could include subscription plans, personal information, etc.

5. **Manager Enters Updated Details:** The manager inputs the updated details for the library member into the provided form.

6. **Update Member Details in Database:** The updated member details are then sent to the database to overwrite the existing member information.

7. **Confirm Member Updated:** The database confirms that the member's details have been successfully updated.

8. **Display Success Message:** Finally, the UI displays a message to the manager indicating that the member's profile has been successfully updated.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow from when a manager decides to update a library member's profile to the confirmation of the update, emphasizing interactions with the system's UI, authentication services, and the database.

Unfortunately, I cannot directly create visual diagrams or images. However, I can provide you with a detailed PlantUML syntax that you can use to generate the sequence diagram for your user story.

This sequence diagram will illustrate the process a FABS user goes through to ensure they see only FABS relevant banner messages, excluding DABS messages, and vice versa.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "FABS User" as FABSUser
participant "Broker Platform" as Broker
participant "Banner Message Service" as BannerService
participant "FABS Message Filter" as FABSFilter
participant "DABS Message Filter" as DABSFilter
participant "User Interface" as UI

FABSUser -> Broker : Login into Broker Platform
Broker -> BannerService : Request Banner Messages
BannerService -> FABSFilter : Apply FABS Filter
BannerService -> DABSFilter : Apply DABS Filter

alt If FABS User
    DABSFilter --> BannerService : Exclude DABS Messages
    FABSFilter --> BannerService : Include FABS Messages
    BannerService -> UI : Display FABS Messages
    UI --> FABUser : Viewed by FABS User
else If DABS User
    FABSFilter --> BannerService : Exclude FABS Messages
    DABSFilter --> BannerService : Include DABS Messages
    BannerService -> UI : Display DABS Messages
    UI --> FABSUser : Viewed by DABS User
end

### Explanation:

1. **FABS User logs into the Broker Platform**: The sequence starts with the FABS user logging into the platform.
2. **Broker Platform requests Banner Messages**: Once logged in, the Broker Platform requests the banner messages to be displayed.
3. **Banner Message Service applies filters**: The Banner Message Service then applies filters to determine which messages to display to the user.
   - **FABS Filter** ensures only FABS related messages are considered for FABS users.
   - **DABS Filter** ensures only DABS related messages are relayed for DABS users.
4. **Alternatives in Filtering**:
   - If the user is identified as a FABS user, DABS messages are excluded, and only FABS messages are forwarded to the User Interface to be displayed.
   - Conversely, if the user is identified as a DABS user, FABS messages are excluded, and only DABS messages are sent to the UI.
5. **Display Messages**: Finally, the relevant messages are displayed to the user based on their role and the filter's actions.

To turn this PlantUML syntax into a diagram, you will need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML code.

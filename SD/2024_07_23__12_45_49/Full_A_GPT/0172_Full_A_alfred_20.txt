Generating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As an Older Person, I want to have a very good battery for ALFRED so I can keep him on the whole day," involves illustrating the flow of interactions for a scenario where the user's primary concern is ensuring ALFRED's device has sufficient battery life to last the entire day. This could involve checking the battery level, receiving notifications about low battery, and perhaps interfaces for optimizing battery usage. 

Here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that outlines a possible sequence of events tailored to this user story. This example assumes that ALFRED has features to monitor its battery life actively, notify the user when the battery is low, and offers suggestions or modes to extend the battery life depending on usage.

```
@startuml
!theme plain

participant OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED's Interface" as interface
participant "Battery Management System" as battery
participant "Notification System" as notification
participant "Energy Saving Mode" as energy

== Daily Battery Check ==
user -> interface: Activate ALFRED
interface -> battery: Check battery status
battery -> interface: Display battery level
user <- interface: Battery level shown

== Battery Low Notification ==
alt Battery level low
    battery -> notification: Trigger low battery alert
    notification -> user: Display low battery warning
    user -> interface: Request energy saving options
    interface -> energy: List available energy saving modes
    user <- interface: Energy saving modes displayed
    user -> interface: Select preferred mode
    interface -> energy: Activate selected mode
else Battery level sufficient
    battery -> interface: Continue normal operation
end

== User Checks Battery Level Manually ==
user -> interface: Request battery level
battery -> interface: Current battery level
user <- interface: Display current battery level

== Outcomes ==
alt Battery level critically low
    battery -> notification: Send critical battery warning
    notification -> user: Prompt to charge ALFRED
else Sufficient battery for the day
    battery -> user: No action required
end

This PlantUML sequence diagram outlines a scenario where the Older Person activates ALFRED, checks the battery status, receives notifications about the battery level, interacts with energy-saving options when needed, and responds to notifications. It covers manual battery level checks by the user and the outcomes based on different battery levels throughout the day. Please note, the actual implementation of these features may vary based on ALFRED's technical specifications and capabilities.

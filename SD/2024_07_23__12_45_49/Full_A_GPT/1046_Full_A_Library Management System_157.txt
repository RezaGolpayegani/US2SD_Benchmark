To generate a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a library member, I want to list all books of an author so that I can choose between them," we will outline the interactions between the system components involved in fulfilling this requirement. Note that specific implementation details may vary, but the following provides a high-level overview of the process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Server" as server
database "Database" as db

member -> web: Enter author's name
web -> server: Request books by author(name)
activate server
server -> db: Query books by author
activate db
db --> server: Return book list
deactivate db
server --> web: Display book list
web --> member: Show book list
deactivate server

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:

1. **Library Member Interaction:** The library member initiates the process by entering the author's name through the system's web interface. This action is the trigger for the book search process related to a specific author.

2. **Web Interface to Server Request:** The web interface, acting as the client-side application, sends a request to the server to fetch books authored by the specified individual. This interaction signifies the system’s responsiveness to user inputs, transferring the user's request to the server for processing.

3. **Server Processes Request:** Upon receiving the request, the server interacts with the database to retrieve information. This step highlights server-side logic and data fetching based on user queries.

4. **Database Query and Response:** The database, containing detailed records of books and authors, processes the server’s query. It searches for all books matching the author's name provided in the request. The database then returns a list of these books back to the server. This demonstrates the system’s ability to handle complex data queries and manage extensive bibliographic records.

5. **Server to Web Interface Response:** After receiving the book list from the database, the server processes this information (if necessary) and forwards it to the web interface. This step may involve parsing the data into a format suitable for web display, signifying the server's role in data preparation.

6. **Display Results to Library Member:** Finally, the web interface presents the list of books by the specified author to the library member. This visual representation of the data concludes the process, providing the user with the information requested.

This sequence diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the system interactions involved when a library member wishes to list all books of an author, from the initial request to the display of information. It encapsulates the flow of data and control between the system's components in response to a user's query.

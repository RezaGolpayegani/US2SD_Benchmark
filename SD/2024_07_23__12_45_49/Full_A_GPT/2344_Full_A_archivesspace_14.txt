Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As an Authenticated User, I want to get access to links to contextual help," involves outlining the interactions between the system components and the user from the point of authentication to accessing the contextual help links. Below is a PlantUML code snippet which you can use to generate this sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
participant "Help Link Service" as HelpService
participant "Database" as DB

User -> Auth : Authenticate
activate Auth
Auth -> DB : Validate Credentials
activate DB
DB --> Auth : Credentials Valid
deactivate DB

Auth --> User : Authentication Success
deactivate Auth

User -> HelpService : Request Help Links
activate HelpService
HelpService -> DB : Fetch Contextual Links
activate DB
DB --> HelpService : Return Links
deactivate DB

HelpService --> User : Display Help Links
deactivate HelpService

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the User initiating an authentication request to the "Authentication Service". The authentication service then validates these credentials with the database. Upon successful validation, the authentication service indicates a successful authentication to the user.

Once authenticated, the user requests access to contextual help links from the "Help Link Service". The help link service then fetches these links from the database and returns them to be displayed to the user.

To make this diagram visually representative and coherent within the context of the Comprehensive Archival Management System Enhancement project, ensure you have the necessary PlantUML setup or access to an online PlantUML editor. This diagram serves as a high-level conceptual overview; further details might be added depending on specific project requirements, user roles, or technical architecture specifics.

To create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story you've provided, we'd delve into the specific interactions between the student (as the actor) and the various components of the digital repository system. Since detailed implementation specifics of the system are not provided, this example makes general assumptions about the system architecture, including a web UI, search controller, user authentication system (like Shibboleth), and the underlying database or content management system (CMS) where research information is stored.

The sequence diagram will illustrate the student's steps in identifying research-related information at Cornell through the digital repository system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Student as st
participant "Web UI" as ui
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Search Controller" as search
database "Content Database" as db

st -> ui : Access the repository
ui -> auth : Authenticate request
auth -> ui : Authentication success

st -> ui : Enter search query for topic
ui -> search : Initiate search for topic
search -> db : Query research related to topic
db -> search : Return search results
search -> ui : Display research results
ui -> st : Show research information, investigators

st -> ui : Select specific research details
ui -> search : Request detailed information
search -> db : Retrieve detailed information
db -> search : Return detailed information
search -> ui : Display detailed information
ui -> st : Show details (researchers, papers, etc.)

This diagram represents the sequence of interactions initiated by a student interested in identifying research related to a particular topic within the Cornell digital repository system. The student first accesses and is authenticated within the repository. They then enter a search query, triggering a series of interactions that lead to the display of relevant research information. This includes details on investigators, research papers, and potentially how to contact departments or researchers for further inquiries.

Please note, this is a high-level sequence diagram. The actual implementation details would depend on specific technologies, APIs, database schemas, and security protocols used by Cornell's digital repository system. Adjustments and enhancements might be necessary to align with specific system architectures and user requirements.

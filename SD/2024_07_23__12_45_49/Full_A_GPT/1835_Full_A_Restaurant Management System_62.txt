Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a user story involves illustrating how different system components interact with each other to achieve a specific functionâ€”in this case, allowing a customer to check the allergy list. Below, I've outlined a PlantUML sequence diagram that models the process.

To generate this diagram, you would use the following PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Backend System" as Backend
database "Restaurant Database" as DB

Customer -> Web : Select dish to view details
Web -> Backend : Request dish details
Backend -> DB : Query dish ingredients & allergy info
DB -> Backend : Return ingredients & allergy info
Backend -> Web : Display dish details & allergy list
Web -> Customer : Show dish details & allergy list

@enduml
```

This script, when executed in a PlantUML environment, will create a visual representation of the interactions between a customer and the Restaurant Management and Operations System when checking the allergy list of a dish.

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:**

1. **Customer Selects Dish:** The process begins with the customer selecting a dish for which they want to view details, including the allergy list.

2. **Web Interface Requests Details:** The Web Interface (either a website or a mobile app) sends a request to the Backend System to retrieve details for the chosen dish.

3. **Backend Queries Database:** The Backend System processes the request and queries the Restaurant Database for the ingredients and allergy information related to the selected dish.

4. **Database Returns Information:** The Restaurant Database returns the requested ingredients and allergy information to the Backend System.

5. **Backend Sends Data to Web Interface:** After receiving the information from the database, the Backend System formats it properly and sends it back to the Web Interface.

6. **Customer Views Allergy List:** Finally, the Web Interface displays the dish details, including the allergy list, enabling the Customer to check for any potential allergens.

This sequence diagram effectively captures the series of interactions involved when a customer wants to check the allergy list for a specific dish, highlighting the role of each component within the system to facilitate this functionality.

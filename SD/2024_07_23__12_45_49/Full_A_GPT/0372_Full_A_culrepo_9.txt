Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves mapping out the interaction between actors and the system components when a library staff member applies or removes an embargo on an item upon the request of an item author. Below is a PlantUML code that illustrates this process:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Library Staff" as staff
actor "Item Author" as author
boundary "Digital Repository System" as system
database "Repository Database" as db

== Request for Embargo Application/Removal ==
author -> staff: Request embargo application/removal
staff -> system: Authenticate login

alt Applying Embargo
    staff -> system: Select item for embargo
    system -> db: Query item details
    db --> system: Return item details
    staff -> system: Apply embargo with specified parameters (e.g., duration)
    system -> db: Update item with embargo details
    db --> system: Confirm embargo applied
    system --> staff: Display confirmation message
else Removing Embargo
    staff -> system: Select item for embargo removal
    system -> db: Query item with embargo details
    db --> system: Return item details
    staff -> system: Request embargo removal
    system -> db: Update item to remove embargo
    db --> system: Confirm embargo removed
    system --> staff: Display confirmation message
end

This sequence diagram starts with an "Item Author" requesting the application or removal of an embargo to a "Library Staff" member. The staff member then logs into the "Digital Repository System" to perform the requested action. If the action is to apply an embargo, the staff member selects the item, applies the embargo with the specified parameters (such as the duration of the embargo), and the system updates the item details in the repository database. Conversely, if the action is to remove an embargo, the staff member selects the embargoed item, requests the removal of the embargo, and the system updates accordingly.

The "Digital Repository System" interacts with the "Repository Database" to query and update item details based on the actions taken by the library staff. Confirmation messages are displayed to the staff member upon successful application or removal of an embargo.

This diagram provides a simplified view focused on the main interactions and does not delve into error handling and other system functionalities that would also be part of a comprehensive implementation.

To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format, we'll illustrate a scenario where an older person configures their ALFRED device for better usability given their visual troubles. This includes adjusting display settings, activating voice commands, and customizing feedback (like increasing font sizes, changing contrast, and ensuring speech interaction is primary). Please note, this PlantUML code snippet assumes familiarity with UML diagramming and PlantUML syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson
participant "ALFRED Device" as Device
participant "DisplaySettings" as Display
participant "SpeechSystem" as Speech
participant "FeedbackSystem" as Feedback

== Configuration Process ==
OlderPerson -> Device : Presses Home Button
Device -> Display : AccessDisplaySettings()
Display -> Display : IncreaseFontSizes()
Display -> Display : AdjustContrasts(high_contrast)
Display --> OlderPerson : DisplaySettingsUpdated()

OlderPerson -> Device : Says "Enable voice commands"
Device -> Speech : ActivateSpeechInteraction()
Speech --> OlderPerson : Confirmation("Voice commands activated")

OlderPerson -> Device : Navigate to Feedback Preferences
Device -> Feedback : AccessFeedbackSettings()
Feedback -> Speech : SetPrimaryInteraction(speech)
Feedback -> Feedback : CustomizeFeedback(high_volume, tactile_alerts)
Feedback --> OlderPerson : FeedbackSettingsConfigured()

### Explanation:
1. **OlderPerson**: The primary actor initiating the configuration process to adapt the ALFRED device for better usability due to visual troubles.
2. **ALFRED Device (Device)**: The system that receives inputs from the older person to adjust settings accordingly.
3. **DisplaySettings (Display)**: Represents the interface component where visual settings can be adjusted, including font sizes and contrast settings.
4. **SpeechSystem (Speech)**: This component handles all voice-related interactions, enabling the older person to control the device using voice commands.
5. **FeedbackSystem (Feedback)**: Manages how the device provides feedback to the user, allowing customization like audio volume and tactile alerts.

#### Process:
1. The older person initiates the configuration by pressing the home button on the device and verbally commanding to enable voice commands.
2. They navigate through display settings to increase font sizes and adjust screen contrast for better visibility.
3. The older person activates speech interaction for easier device use without relying on visual cues.
4. Finally, they adjust the feedback preferences to ensure they receive clear and understandable feedback from the device, catering to their visual impairments.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of how an older person with visual troubles could configure the ALFRED device for better usability.

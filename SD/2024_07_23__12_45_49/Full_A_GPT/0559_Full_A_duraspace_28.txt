Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story using PlantUML requires breaking down the interaction into its fundamental steps. The user story in question is: "As a DAMS manager, I want to know what repository an object belongs to." Below is a sample sequence diagram illustrating this process in PlantUML syntax.

Please note, the diagram assumes a simple interaction flow where the DAMS manager queries the system (DIMS) to find out the repository of a specific object. This involves interaction between the DAMS manager, the system interface, and possibly the system's database where the repository information is stored.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DAMS Manager" as Manager
participant "DIMS Interface" as Interface
database "DIMS Database" as Database

Manager -> Interface : Request repository information for object X
activate Interface
Interface -> Database : Query repository of object X
activate Database
Database -> Interface : Return repository information
deactivate Database
Interface -> Manager : Display repository information
deactivate Interface
@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:
1. **DAMS Manager initiates a request**: The DAMS manager (user) interacts with the DIMS (DAMS Integration and Management System) interface, requesting information about the repository to which a specific object (let's call it object X) belongs.
   
2. **DIMS Interface processes the request**: Upon receiving the request from the DAMS manager, the DIMS interface processes this request to understand that the information required is about finding the repository of object X.

3. **Query sent to DIMS Database**: The DIMS interface formulates a query based on the request (finding the repository of object X) and sends this query to the DIMS database where all data regarding objects and their respective repositories is stored.

4. **DIMS Database returns information**: The DIMS database processes the query, locates the information about object X's repository, and returns this information back to the DIMS interface.

5. **DIMS Interface displays the information**: Finally, the repository information, now retrieved from the database, is presented back to the DAMS manager through the DIMS interface, completing the request cycle.

This PlantUML diagram provides a clear and sequential visualization of the interactions and processes involved in retrieving and displaying the repository information of a specific object upon request by a DAMS manager within the DAMS Integration and Management System (DIMS) environment.

Given your request for a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the specific user story: "As a library manager, I want to see the due date of each book so that I can track them", here is a fundamental representation of how the sequence might unfold in CLMS. This diagram focuses on the interactions between the library manager, the system (specifically the library management system's server), and the database components when querying for book due dates.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryManager as Manager
participant "LibraryManagementSystem" as System
database "LibraryDatabase" as Database

Manager -> System : Request book due dates
activate System

System -> Database : Query due dates of all borrowed books
activate Database

Database --> System : Return book due dates
deactivate Database

System --> Manager : Display book due dates
deactivate System

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:
1. The library manager initiates a request to the library management system to see the due dates of each book.
2. The system processes this request and queries the library database for the due dates of all borrowed books.
3. The database returns the due dates of the borrowed books back to the system.
4. The library management system then displays this information to the library manager.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the interaction. The actual implementation can include additional steps such as authentication and authorization of the library manager, error handling if the database fails to retrieve the information, and a more interactive or graphical display of the due dates for better user experience.

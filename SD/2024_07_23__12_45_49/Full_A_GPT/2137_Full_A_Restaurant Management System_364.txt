Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story, "As an employee, I want to see reservations, so that I won't give reserved tables to other customers," involves illustrating the interactions between the user (employee), and the system components such as the user interface (UI), backend server, and the database where reservations are stored and managed. Here's a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee as emp
participant "UI: Reservation Page" as ui
participant "Backend Server" as backend
database "Database" as db

emp -> ui: Request reservation list
ui -> backend: Get all reservations
backend -> db: Fetch reservation data
db -> backend: Return reservation data
backend -> ui: Show reservations list
ui -> emp: Display reservations
@enduml
```

This diagram walks through the basic flow from the moment an employee wants to see all reservations to ensure tables are not double-booked. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Employee Requests Reservation List**: The process starts with the employee requesting to see all current reservations. This action is initiated through the User Interface of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, specifically on the Reservations Page.

2. **UI Requests Reservations from Backend**: The UI acts on the employee's request and sends a command to the Backend Server to retrieve all reservations.

3. **Backend Server Fetches Data from Database**: The Backend Server processes the request from the UI and fetches the required reservation data from the database. This is where all reservation records are stored.

4. **Database Returns Reservation Data**: The Database returns the requested reservation data back to the Backend Server. This data includes details such as reservation time, table number, customer name, and any special requests.

5. **Backend Server Sends Data to UI**: With the reservation data retrieved, the Backend Server processes and sends it back to the UI.

6. **UI Displays Reservations to Employee**: Finally, the UI updates to display the list of all reservations to the employee. This enables the employee to see which tables are reserved and at what times, ensuring they do not assign reserved tables to other customers.

This sequence ensures that the employee has the latest information on table reservations, aiding in efficient table management and enhancing the customer dining experience.

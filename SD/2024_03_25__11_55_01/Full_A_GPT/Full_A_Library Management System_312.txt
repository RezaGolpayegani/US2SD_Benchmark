This task involves converting a textual description into a sequence diagram which essentially maps out the sequence of actions and interactions in a system. However, since I cannot draw diagrams directly due to being a text-based model, you can use the Plant UML syntax provided here to generate the sequence diagram for the user story mentioned:

```plantuml

@startuml

participant "Member" as M
database "Library Database" as LD
participant "Library System" as LS

M -> LS: RequestUpdateReservation(bookId, newDate)
activate LS

LS -> LD: getReservationDetails(bookId)
activate LD
LD -->> LS: ReservationDetails
deactivate LD 

LS -> LS: validateChanges(ReservationDetails, newDate)
activate LS
LS -->> LS: isValid

alt isValid
    LS -> LD: UpdateReservation(bookId, newDate)
    activate LD
    LD -->> LS: ConfirmationMessage
    deactivate LD 
else
    LS --> M: ErrorMessage
end

deactivate LS 
LS --> M: ConfirmationMessage

@enduml

```

This Plant UML script describes a sequence where:

1. Member sends a request to the Library System to update an online reservation for a specific book and on a new date.
2. The Library System communicates with the Library Database to get existing reservation details.
3. The Library System validates the new reservation date.
4. If the changes are valid, the Library System updates the reservation in the Library Database and the database returns a confirmation message.
5. If not valid, the Library System sends an error message to the Member.
6. Finally, the Library System sends a confirmation message to the Member.

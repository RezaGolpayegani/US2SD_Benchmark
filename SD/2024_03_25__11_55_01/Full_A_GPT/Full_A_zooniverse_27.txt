Here is a sequence diagram represented in PlantUML syntax. 

This sequence diagram includes a Zooniverse admin, an Automation System for analyzing pictures, a Citizen User for providing annotations, and the Talk System where comments are retrieved. 

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor ZooniverseAdmin
entity AutomationSystem
entity CitizenUser
database TalkSystem

ZooniverseAdmin -> AutomationSystem: Request pic analysis
activate AutomationSystem
AutomationSystem --> ZooniverseAdmin: Return pic analysis
deactivate AutomationSystem

ZooniverseAdmin -> CitizenUser: Request citizen annotations
activate CitizenUser
CitizenUser --> ZooniverseAdmin: Return citizen annotations
deactivate CitizenUser

ZooniverseAdmin -> TalkSystem: Request Talk comments
activate TalkSystem
TalkSystem --> ZooniverseAdmin: Return Talk comments
deactivate TalkSystem

ZooniverseAdmin --> ZooniverseAdmin: Assess picture

Copy and paste the above code into the PlantUML online editor, or any other editor that supports PlantUML syntax, to generate the corresponding sequence diagram. 

Please adjust this sample as necessary or add further sequences to suit your specific project requirements.
Also, to represent time consuming processes and difference in the response time, use delays like ":5 seconds:" in between processes.

Remember that actors and entities might have different interactions and processes in different projects.
It's encouraged to modify and tailor this sample to your specific project's needs.

The Plant UML sequence diagram for entering customer reviews as an employee would be defined as follows:

```plantUML
@startuml
boundary "User Interface" as UI
Database Reviews
Actor Employee
participant "Reviews System" as RS

Employee -> UI: Enter review
activate UI
UI -> RS: Handle review entry
activate RS
RS -> Reviews: Check customer's consent
activate Reviews
Reviews --> RS: Consent Status
deactivate Reviews
alt Consent Given
RS --> UI: Allow review entry
deactivate RS
UI --> Employee: Submit review
deactivate UI
Employee -> UI: Confirm submission
activate UI
UI -> RS : Submit review
activate RS
RS -> Reviews : Save review
activate Reviews
Reviews --> RS : Confirmation
deactivate Reviews
RS --> UI : Review saved successfully
deactivate RS
UI --> Employee : Show success message
deactivate UI

end

This diagram starts with the employee entering the review via the User Interface (UI), which then attempts to handle the review entry. It does so by checking with the Reviews Database for customer's consent. 
If consent is given, the system allows the employee to submit the review, save it, and finally confirm to the employee that the action was successful. 
If consent was not given, the system denies the review entry, and shows an error message to the employee.

Below is a sample sequence diagram code in PlantUML format according to the user story. Please note that due to the text nature of the response I cannot draw an actual diagram. 

This is a simplified version and actual implementation may require more details based on specific systems and scenarios.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
entity OrderSystem
database OrderDatabase

Waiter -> OrderSystem: Request to see orders
activate OrderSystem

OrderSystem -> OrderDatabase: Fetch orders
activate OrderDatabase

OrderDatabase --> OrderSystem: Return orders
deactivate OrderDatabase

OrderSystem --> Waiter: Display orders
deactivate OrderSystem
@enduml
```

In this diagram, 'Waiter' represents the user, 'OrderSystem' is the system where the orders are managed, and 'OrderDatabase' is where orders are stored. 

1. The Waiter sends a request to see the orders to the OrderSystem.
2. The OrderSystem then requests the orders from the OrderDatabase.
3. The OrderDatabase returns the orders back to the OrderSystem.
4. Finally, the OrderSystem displays the received orders to the Waiter.
 
This sequence diagram can be visualized by copying the code into a PlantUML editor.

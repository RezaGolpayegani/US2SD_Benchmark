Upon initiating the request by the API user, the GDP Normaliser fetches the data from the database by ID. It then parses the data, calculates the GDP normalisation by comparing it with the GDP of corresponding entries. Once done, it returns the normalised data to the API user.

However, this is a simple flow and actual implementation might include error checkings as well as other API middleware functions such as authentication, authorisation checks before giving the user the authority to access and normalise the data.

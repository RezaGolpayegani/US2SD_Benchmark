Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model, I'm unable to create visual drawings such as diagrams. However, I can certainly provide a step-by-step structure for the sequence diagram in PlantUML format, which you can then use to construct the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Manager" as manager
participant "Library System" as system

manager --> system: login()
activate system
system --> manager: showDashboard()
activate manager
manager --> system: accessBookRegistry()
activate system
system --> manager: displayBooks()
deactivate system
manager --> system: addBook(inputBookDetails())
activate system
system --> manager: saveBookDetails()
deactivate system

manager --> system: accessBorrowerRegistry()
activate system
system --> manager: displayBorrowers()
deactivate system
manager --> system: checkOutBook(inputBorrowerDetails(), inputBookDetails())
activate system
system --> manager: saveBorrowerDetails()
deactivate system
system --> manager: confirmAvailability(inputBookDetails())
activate system
system --> manager: markAsBorrowed(inputBookDetails(), updateBorrowerRecord())

```
This PlantUML code describes the actions the library manager might perform while using the library system, such as logging in, accessing the book registry, adding new book details, accessing the borrower registry, checking out a book, and confirming the availability of a book.

Remember, you must interpret and adjust this proposed sequence diagram to suit the actual needs and nuances of your library management system.

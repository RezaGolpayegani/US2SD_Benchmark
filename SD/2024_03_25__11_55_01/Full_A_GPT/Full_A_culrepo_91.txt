Here's the sequence diagram in PlantUML code

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Administrator
participant Calendar as C
participant Database as DB

Administrator -> C: Add "release date" to calendar
C -> DB: Check access rights
DB --> C: Access granted
C -> DB: Update date information for a report/dataset
DB --> C: Date information Updated
C --> Administrator: Update Success
@enduml
```
This code should be used in PlantUML to generate a sequence diagram. It depicts a DB/IR administrator ("Administrator") who wants to add future release dates of reports/datasets to a calendar feature ("Calendar"). The administrator initiates the sequence by attempting to add a release date to the calendar. 

The calendar system then interacts with the database ("DB") to check the administrator's access rights. If the access is granted, the system is expected to update the date information for a specified report or dataset. Once the database has updated the necessary information, it informs the Calendar system of the successful update, which then communicates this confirmation back to the Administrator.

Here is a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format that represents the user store mentioned:

```
@startuml
actor Manager
boundary SalesSystem
database SalesData
entity Accountant

Manager -> SalesSystem: Request Total Sales and Profits
activate SalesSystem
SalesSystem -> SalesData: Query Total Sales and Profits
activate SalesData
SalesData --> SalesSystem: Return Sales and Profits
deactivate SalesData
SalesSystem --> Manager: Show Total Sales and Profits
deactivate SalesSystem
Manager -> Accountant: Provide Salaries Basis
activate Accountant
Accountant -> Accountant: Calculate Salaries
Accountant -> Manager: Confirm Salaries
deactivate Accountant
@enduml
```
In this sequence, the manager requests the total sales and profit from the Sales System. The Sales System then queries this information from the Sales Data database. Once the information is received back, the Sales System displays this to the manager.

Afterward, the manager interacts with the Accountant entity to provide the basis of salaries (which is the total sales and profit information). The Accountant calculates the salaries and confirms them with the manager.

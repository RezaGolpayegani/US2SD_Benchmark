Creating a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on the given user story would require actual code of that diagram. Here is a basic example showing how such a sequence might look like. This example is simplified and actual code may depend on your specific needs:

```plantuml
@startuml
Title Restrict a file from view - sequence diagram

participant Archivist
participant "File System" as FS
participant File

Archivist -> File : chooseFile()
activate File

File -> FS : restrictFile()
activate FS

FS -->> File : fileUpdated()
deactivate FS

File -->> Archivist : updatedFile()
deactivate File
@enduml
```

This describes a situation where:

1. The `Archivist` chooses a `File` that they want to restrict. 
2. The `File` then makes a request to the `File System` (FS) to have it restricted.
3. After the `File System` restricts the file, it sends a response back to the `File` indicating that the file has been updated.
4. This updated file status is then reported back to the `Archivist`.

Please note that this scenario is quite simplified, and real sequence may vary based on your specific system structure and dependencies. For example, you may need to consider authentication or specify exact methods that are being invoked depending on your systemâ€™s needs.

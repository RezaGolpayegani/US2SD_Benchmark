Based on your project description and user story, here's a sequence diagram coded in Plant UML:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Moderator" as M
participant "System" as S

M -> S: RequestGameTranscript(gameID)
note right: The moderator requests \nthe transcript for a specific game.

S -> S: FetchGameTranscript(gameID)
note right: System fetches the transcript\nfrom the database.
activate S #Yellow

S --> M: ReturnTranscriptData
note right: Returns the transcript data\nto the moderator.
deactivate S

M -> S: ExportTranscriptAsHTML(data)
note right: Asks system to turn transcript data\ninto an HTML file.
activate S #Yellow

S -> S : ConvertToHTMLFormat(data)
note right: System converts the \ntranscript data into HTML.
activate S #Yellow

S --> M: TransmitHTMLFile
note right: The HTML file is sent to the moderator.
deactivate S

@enduml
```

This code should present the sequence of actions when a moderator wants to export a transcript of a game as a HTML file to save the stories and estimates locally.

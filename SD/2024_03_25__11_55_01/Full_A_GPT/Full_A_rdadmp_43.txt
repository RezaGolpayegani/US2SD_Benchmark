Here's an example of how you might represent this user story in a PlantUML sequence diagram:

```plantuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "Data Manager" as DM
participant "Data Storage" as DS

RM -> DM : Request for data type details
activate DM
DM ->  DS : Fetch data type details
activate DS
DS --> DM: Response 
deactivate DS
DM -- > RM: Data type details
deactivate DM
```
This simple sequence diagram shows the interaction between the repository manager, data manager, and data storage. The repository manager requests for data type details from the data manager, who subsequently fetches these details from the data storage. The data storage returns the information to the data manager, who then provides the data type details to the repository manager.

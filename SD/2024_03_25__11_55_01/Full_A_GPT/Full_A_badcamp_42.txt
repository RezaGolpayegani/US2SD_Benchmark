Here's your sequence diagram for the given user story in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Summit Coordinator" as SC
participant "System"
participant "Database"

SC -> System : Enter Summit Details
activate System
System -> Database : Store Summit Details
activate Database
Database --> System : Confirmation Message
deactivate Database
System --> SC : Display confirmation 
deactivate System
@enduml
```

So, the diagram describes the following sequence of events:
1. The `Summit Coordinator` gives the command to the `System` to enter details about the summit.
2. The `System` receives this command and sends a request to the `Database` to store these details.
3. The `Database` stores the details and sends a confirmation message back to the `System`.
4. Finally, the `System` provides the `Summit Coordinator` with a confirmation that the details have been stored. 

Please replace `"summit Details"` with your specific summit detail and add more interactions if needed.

Note: This is a very basic sequence diagram without any error handling and simplicity in mind. You can go more detailed by adding authentication, error handling, more complex data manipulation. Also, bearer of this code should replace `System, Database, Summit Coordinator` with the correct names from your application.

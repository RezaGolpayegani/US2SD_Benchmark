Since the request requires a graphical representation (sequence diagram), I'm not able to provide a textual version of a sequence diagram. However, I can give you an illustrative textual representation with which you can create your own sequence diagram in Plant UML.

```
@startuml
Title Get File F in correct format - Sequence Diagram

actor "Agency User" as agency
entity "UI" as ui
entity "Server" as server

agency-> ui: Request File F
ui -> server: Fetch File F
activate server
server --> ui: Send File F
deactivate server
ui --> agency: Display File F
@enduml
```

Consider "Agency User" as the actor. The Agency User requests File F. This request is sent to the UI. The UI then requests the Server to fetch File F. The Server sends back File F, which the UI then displays to the Agency User.

Remember, the textual representation above is prepared in PlantUML format. Using the described text, you can draw a sequence diagram in the editor supporting PlantUML.

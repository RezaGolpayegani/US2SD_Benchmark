Sure, here is a basic sequence diagram described in Plant UML syntax for the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant ALFREDSensor as "ALFRED Fall Detection Sensor"
participant ALFREDDevice as "ALFRED Device"
participant EmergencyContact as "Emergency Contact"

OlderPerson --> ALFREDSensor: Fall Detected
ALFREDSensor --> ALFREDDevice: Signal Fall
activate ALFREDDevice
ALFREDDevice --> ALFREDDevice: Confirm Fall
ALFREDDevice --> EmergencyContact: Sends Alert
deactivate ALFREDDevice
@enduml
```

This diagram involves the following sequence:

1. The OlderPerson falls, which is detected by the ALFRED fall detection sensor.
2. The sensor sends a signal indicating the fall to the ALFRED device.
3. ALFRED device gets activated and confirms the fall.
4. The ALFRED device, after confirming the fall, sends an alert to a specific emergency contact.
5. The ALFRED device is then deactivated.  

This PlantUML code can be pasted into an online PlantUML editor to generate a visual sequence diagram. Please realize this is a simplified sequence for this user story and actual implementation could involve additional steps.

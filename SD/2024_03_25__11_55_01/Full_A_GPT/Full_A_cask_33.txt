Given the complexity of the request, a text representation of the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format might not be the most optimal way to capture the interactions. However, here is the PlantUML sequence diagram code based on understanding from your project description:

```plantuml

@startuml

title Plugin Update Sequence Diagram

participant "Plugin Developer" as P
participant "Dataset Type" as D
participant "Dataset Instance" as I
participant "Plugin" as Pl
participant "Pipeline" as Pi

P -> Pl : Create new version
activate Pl
Pl -> D: Upgrade Code
activate D
D -> I: Update Instance with upgraded code
deactivate D
activate I
I -> Pl: Instance updated
deactivate I
Pl -> Pi: Update Pipeline to use new version
deactivate Pl
activate Pi
Pi -> P: Pipeline updated

```

Explanation:
1. The Plugin Developer initiates the process by creating a new version of the Plugin.
2. The Plugin then upgrades the code of the Dataset Type.
3. This Dataset Type updates the Dataset Instance with the upgraded code.
4. After the Dataset Instance is updated, it sends confirmation back to the Plugin.
5. The Plugin then updates the Pipeline to use the new version
6. After updating the pipeline, the confirmation is sent back to the Plugin Developer.

Please adjust the code as you see fit or use a graphical UML editor for better results.

Creating a sequence diagram for the user story in PlantUML format requires knowledge on how to write PlantUML syntax. Unfortunately, as a language model AI, I don't have the ability to create visuals. But, instead, I am able to provide a basic PlantUML sequence diagram syntax that incapsulates the interactions between the Repository Manager and the Repository:

```plantuml
@startuml

title Repository Management - Create, Update, Delete Records

participant "Repository Manager" as RM
database "Repository" as DB

group Create Record
  RM->DB: CreateRecord()
  DB->DB: InsertRecord()
  DB-->>RM: RecordCreated()
end

group Update Record
  RM->DB: UpdateRecord()
  DB->DB: ModifyRecord()
  DB-->>RM: RecordUpdated()
end

group Delete Record
  RM->DB: DeleteRecord()
  DB->DB: RemoveRecord()
  DB-->>RM: RecordDeleted()
end

@enduml
```

This is a basic template for your user story. 
- In the "create record" group, it represents the Manager creating a record in the repository.
- In the "update record" group, it shows the Manager updating a specific record in the repository.
- In the "delete record" group, it represents the Manager deleting a certain record from the repository.

Please tailor this to your specific technical needs.

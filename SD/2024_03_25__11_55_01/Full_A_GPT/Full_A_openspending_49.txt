As an AI model, I'm text-based and don't have the ability to draw models or diagrams, but here's a representation of the sequence diagram in Plant UML written form that you could use for your User Story:

```
@startuml
title Search Dataset by Title and Metadata

Actor User as u
participant "Search Service" as s
database "Dataset Repository" as d

u -> s: SearchRequest(title, metadata)
activate s
s -> d: queryDatasets(title, metadata)
activate d
d --> s: DatasetList
deactivate d
s --> u: SearchResponse(DatasetList)
deactivate s

@enduml
```

In this sequence:

1. The User (Data Consuming User) sends a Search Request containing the targeted title and metadata to the Search Service.
2. The Search Service is activated and it relays the request to query for datasets matching the criteria from the Dataset Repository.
3. The Dataset Repository returns a list of all datasets that match the criteria given.
4. The Search Service then forwards this list back to the User in a Search Response message.

This should capture the main communication between components for your user story. You can refine it according to your specific system design. Note that PlantUML would transform this into a visual diagram if run through a PlantUML processor.

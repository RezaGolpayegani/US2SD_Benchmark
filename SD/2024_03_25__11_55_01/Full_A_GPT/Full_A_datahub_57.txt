This is a sequence diagram showing the interaction between the owner, an invited member, and the system. The owner inputs the email of the member they want to invite into the system. The system validates the email, generates an invitation link, sends it to the member, who then clicks on the invitation link, registers, and then the system notifies the owner of the successful registration of the new member.

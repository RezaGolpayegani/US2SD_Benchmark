Sequence diagrams in Plant UML format are difficult to generate purely with text as they require specific syntax and formatting that is not compatible with plain text. However, the description can be detailed and then translated into the Plant UML format by a developer.

Here is a general walkthrough:

1. The librarian (actor) initiates the system to view the list of expired books.
2. The system fetches the data from the database.
3. The database returns a list of expired books.
4. The system displays the list to the librarian.
5. The librarian chooses to send a notification to the member who has borrowed the expired book.
6. The system fetches the member's contact information from the database.
7. The database provides the information.
8. The system sends a notification to the member to return the expired books.

Once this description is recorded, it can be translated into a sequence diagram using specific Plant UML syntax:

```
@startuml
actor Librarian
entity "Library System" as system
database "Library Database" as database

Librarian -> system: Request expired books list
system -> database: Fetch expired books list
database --> system: Provide expired books list
system -> Librarian: Display expired books list

Librarian -> system: Choose to notify member
system -> database: Fetch member contact details
database --> system: Provide member contact details
system -> Librarian: Send notification
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram text will create a diagram where the Librarian interacts with the System to review expired books and send notifications to users who have these books borrowed.

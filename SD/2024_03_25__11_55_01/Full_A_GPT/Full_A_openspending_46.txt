Here is a Sequences Diagram represented in PlantUML for the provided User Story scenario. Note that this is a simplified version and actual steps may vary based on the detailed requirements. 

Enclose the following PlantUML code in @startuml and @enduml tags:

```
actor DataPublishingUser as UP
entity PythonClient as PC
database Datastore as DS

UP -> PC : addData(data)
activate PC

PC -> DS : insertDataBatch(data)
activate DS

DS -->> PC : confirmation
deactivate DS

PC -->> UP : confirmation
deactivate PC
```

This diagram represents the following sequence of interactions via Python Client:

- The Data Publishing User (UP) initiates the action of adding data in bulk by sending a request to the Python Client (PC) 
- Upon receiving the request, the Python Client interacts with the Datastore (DS) to insert the batch of data.
- After successfully inserting the data, Datastore sends a confirmation message back to Python Client.
- Python Client then sends this confirmation message back to Data Publishing User to let them know that the data has been successfully added in bulk.

You can copy and paste the above code (excluding quotation marks) into a PlantUML editor to view the diagram visualization.

Remember to import/update all necessary Python dependencies and modules which will be defined on the actual system to make this process possible.

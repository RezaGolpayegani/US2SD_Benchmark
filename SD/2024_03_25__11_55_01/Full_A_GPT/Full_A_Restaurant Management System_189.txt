We can't generate actual diagrams because this is a text-based platform, but here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML language that fits the user story: 

```plantuml
title See Customer Satisfaction Ratio Process

participant Manager
participant UI
participant System
participant Database

Manager -> UI : Request for Customer Satisfaction Ratio Report
activate UI

UI -> System : Trigger generation of Satisfaction Ratio Report
activate System 

System -> Database : Fetch all customer reviews and ratings 
activate Database

Database -->> System : Customer reviews and ratings
deactivate Database

System -> System : Calculate Satisfaction Ratio 

System -->> UI : Display Satisfaction Ratio Report
deactivate System

UI -->> Manager : Show Satisfaction Ratio Report
deactivate UI

end title
```

This simple sequence diagram scenario involves the manager requesting to view the customer satisfaction ratio, the system fetching all relevant details, calculating the ratio and providing the report back to the manager. Please adapt the actual calculation process based on your specific requirements and system architecture.

To view this sequence diagram, you may input it to online PlantUML editor or any other UML tools that support PlantUML syntax.

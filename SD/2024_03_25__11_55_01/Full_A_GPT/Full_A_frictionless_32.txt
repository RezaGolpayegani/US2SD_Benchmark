Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to physically draw a sequence diagram. However, I can describe the steps on how the sequence diagram would look like in plain English that is similar to Plant UML code format:

The sequence diagram could contain the following steps:

1. `Developer` sends a `Request Integration` message to the `Integration System`.

2. `Integration System` would then interact with `Data Package` by sending an `Extract Data` message.

3. `Data Package` would respond with a `Package Data` message back to `Integration System`.

4. `Integration System` would then interact with `DSpace` by issuing an `Integrate Data` message.

5. `DSpace` acknowledges the integration by sending a `Confirm Integration` message back to `Integration System`.

6. Finally, `Integration System` informs `Developer` about the success of the operation by sending a `Confirm Integration` message.

In Plant UML you would represent it as follow:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Developer
participant Integration System
participant Data Package
participant DSpace

Developer -> Integration System: Request Integration
Integration System -> Data Package: Extract Data
Data Package --> Integration System: Package Data
Integration System -> DSpace: Integrate Data
DSpace --> Integration System: Confirm Integration
Integration System -> Developer: Confirm Integration

Please note you should use a proper Plant UML Editor to generate the sequence diagram based on the Plant UML code above.
This diagram aligns with the user story and provides clear sequence for actions that need to happen for successful integration with DSpace.

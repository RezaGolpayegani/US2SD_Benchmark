Here's the PlantUML sequence diagram code for this User Story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "WaitingTimeTable" as W
participant "KitchenSystem" as K


Waiter -> W : updateWaitingTime
activate W

W -> W : validateTime
W --> Waiter : confirmation
deactivate W

Waiter -> K : informExtendedWaitingTime
activate K

K --> Waiter : Acknowledge
deactivate K

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the sequence of actions when a waiter wants to update the waiting time of the table. The waiter begins by sending a request to the `WaitingTimeTable` to `updateWaitingTime`. 

The `WaitingTimeTable` then validates the time, and upon successful validation, a confirmation is sent back to the waiter. 

The waiter, now informed about the updated waiting time, alerts the `KitchenSystem` about the `informExtendedWaitingTime`. 

Upon receiving this information, the `KitchenSystem` acknowledges and the interaction ends.

Remember, this is a simple arrangement, and the real implementation could have a lot more steps depending on the specifics of your system.

Here's a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the user story "As a waiter, I want to deselect order items."

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Waiter" as W
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant "Database" as DB

W -> OMS: Deselects item from order
activate OMS
OMS -> DB: Sends request to update order
activate DB

DB --> OMS: Confirms order update
deactivate DB
OMS --> W: Returns confirmation of order update
deactivate OMS
@enduml
```

This sequence begins with the waiter deselecting an item from a customer's order. The Order Management System (OMS), upon receiving this instruction, communicates with the Database to remove the specified item. Once this operation is completed, the database confirms the update back to the OMS, which in turn confirms to the waiter that the item has been removed from the order. 

Please note, this sequence diagram assumes the presence of an Order Management System and a database in the restaurant's workflow. These are both fairly common in modern eateries and have been included here to showcase how an order might be updated to remove a specific item. 

Also note that this is just one possible interpretation of the user story. A different diagram might make sense, depending on the specifics of the restaurant's workflow and systems.

Sequence diagrams mainly focus on the interaction between objects, which includes exchange messages, creating objects, destroying objects etc. In the context of your provided User Story, the important subjects would likely be the Repository Manager, Collection, Object, and possibly a Language Change Reporting System. An example of a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML code:

```puml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as R
participant "Collection" as C
participant "Object" as O
participant "Language Change Reporting System" as L

R -> C : isThereAnyLanguageChange()
activate C
C -> O : isThereAnyLanguageChange()
activate O
O --> C : languageChangeStatus()
deactivate O
C --> R : languageChangeStatus()
deactivate C
R -> L : reportLanguageChange(languageChangeStatus())
activate L
L --> R : acknowledgeReport()
deactivate L
@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram reflects the following process:

1. The Repository Manager queries a Collection for any language changes.
2. The Collection then passes this query onto each Object it contains. 
3. Each Object then checks for language changes and returns the status to the Collection.
4. The Collection returns the aggregated language change status to the Repository Manager.
5. If there are changes, Repository Manager uses a Language Change Reporting System to report these changes.
6. The Language Change Reporting System acknowledges the receipt of this report.

You can modify it or recreate it as per your needs. Note that PlantUML diagrams can be viewed using any tool that can interpret PlantUML code.

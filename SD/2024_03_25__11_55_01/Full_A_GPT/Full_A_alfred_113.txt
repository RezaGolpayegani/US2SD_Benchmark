Due to the limitations of this platform, a graphical PlantUML description cannot be represented. However, I can give you a outlined PlantUML code representation for the sequence diagram. 

To generate the diagram, you'll need to paste this description into a PlantUML environment (https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson as a
participant ALFRED as b
participant Game as c

a -> b : requests game that combines mental and physical exercise
activate b

b -> c : Fetches list of suitable games
activate c

c -> c : Filters games that require mental and physical activities

c --> b : Returns list of suitable games
deactivate c

b --> a : Shows list of suitable games
deactivate b

a --> b : Selects preferred game from list
activate b

b -> c : Starts selected game
activate c

c --> b : Game results
deactivate c

b --> a : Shows game result
deactivate b

This sequence diagram starts with an OlderPerson requesting ALFRED for a game that combines mental and physical exercises. ALFRED fetches a list of suitable games, filters them, and shows the OlderPerson. The OlderPerson selects a game, ALFRED starts it, receives the game results and shows the results to the OlderPerson.

Below is the Plant UML code which describes the sequence of interactions to edit the content of the email automatically sent to new Certified Scrum Masters and Product Owners. The actors involved here are the Site Editor and the Email System.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteEditor
entity EmailSystem

SiteEditor --> EmailSystem: Login
activate EmailSystem
EmailSystem --> SiteEditor: Show Dashboard
deactivate EmailSystem
activate SiteEditor
SiteEditor --> EmailSystem: Navigate to Email Templates
deactivate SiteEditor
activate EmailSystem
EmailSystem --> SiteEditor: Show Email Templates
deactivate EmailSystem
activate SiteEditor
SiteEditor --> EmailSystem: Choose Email for New Scrum Masters
deactivate SiteEditor
activate EmailSystem
EmailSystem --> SiteEditor: Show Email Details
deactivate EmailSystem
activate SiteEditor
SiteEditor --> EmailSystem: Edit Content and Save
deactivate SiteEditor
activate EmailSystem
EmailSystem --> SiteEditor: Confirm Update and Show Updated Details
deactivate EmailSystem
@enduml
```

This code generates a sequence diagram where the site editor logs into the system, navigates to the email templates, chooses the appropriate email for New Scrum Masters and Product Owners, edits the content and saves. The email system then confirms the update and shows the updated details to the site editor. 

This is a high-level outline and the specific steps and interactions would depend on the specific system and user interface. The code should be used in any software which supports Plant UML to generate the actual diagram.

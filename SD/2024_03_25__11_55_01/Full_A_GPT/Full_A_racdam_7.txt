Unfortunately, I can not create diagrams on this platform text-based. However, I can give you instructions on how you can create the desired sequence diagram in Plant UML:

Here is a PlantUML code for the required sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Sequence Diagram - Add Restricion End Date To File
  
participant "Archivist" as A
database "Archive database" as DB
entity "File Management" as FM
entity "Constraint Management" as CM

A -> FM: Select File
activate FM
FM -> DB: Fetch File
DB -->FM: Return File
FM --> A: Show File & its details
deactivate FM

A -> CM: Add end date restriction to file
activate CM
CM -> DB: Update File
DB --> CM : File Updated
CM --> A: Restricted end date added to file
deactivate CM
@enduml
```

In the Sequence Diagram, Archivist communicates with File Management to select and fetch a file from the Archive database. Once the archivist is presented with the file and its details, the archivist then communicates with Constraint Management to add an end date restriction to the file. The added restriction is updated in the database and the confirmation is then sent to the archivist from Constraint Management.

To visualize the diagram, copy and paste the code to a PlantUML editor and generate the diagram.

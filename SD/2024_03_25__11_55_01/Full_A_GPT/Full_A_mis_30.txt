Considering that text-driven interfaces like this one can't create visual diagrams, the following is the Plant UML syntax you can use to produce a sequence diagram. You may use an online PlantUML tool or any IDE that supports PlantUML to generate the diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Grant Embargo Privileges Diagram

actor DigitalRecordsArchivist as A
participant Repository as B
participant "Repository\nAdministrator" as C

note over A: Wants to grant embargo privileges

A -> B: requestEmbargoPrivileges(AdminID)
note over B: Validate request from the Archivist%
B -> C: grantEmbargoPrivileges(AdminID)
note over C: Embargo privileges updated

@enduml
```

In the diagram:

- DigitalRecordsArchivist (A) initiates the process (represented as an actor).
- The Repository (B) (possibly a system or server), is responsible for validating the request made by the Archivist.
- Once validated, the Repository (B) updates the privileges of the Repository Administrator (C).

Each arrow represents the flow of data or a request made from one participant to another complete with a decription of the action being taken.

I have assumed the process to be as straight-forward as described. Do modify if there are more details or intermediate steps.

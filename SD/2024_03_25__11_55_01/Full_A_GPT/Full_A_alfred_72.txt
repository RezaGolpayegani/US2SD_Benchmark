Sure, here's an example in PlantUML code for a sequence diagram based on the given user story:

```
@startuml
title ALFRED - Museum operations for the Older Person

actor OlderPerson as OP

entity ALFRED as AI
database "Museum Database" as DB

OP -> AI: "ALFRED, tell me about art expositions"

note right
    Older person uses a voice assistant (ALFRED)
end note

AI -> DB: Request information about art expositions

DB --> AI: Return information about art expositions

AI --> OP: Provide information about art expositions

OP -> AI: "ALFRED, tell me about a specific museum"

AI -> DB: Request information about specific museum

DB --> AI: Return information about specific museum

AI --> OP: Provide information about specific museum

@enduml
```

This diagram shows an older person interacting with the ALFRED device, which retrieves information from a museum database based on the user's requests. The results are then relayed back to the person by ALFRED.

The actual sequence will vary based on details such as the technical implementation of ALFRED, the specific database interactions used, and the interface adopted for the older person. The sample sequence diagram merely represents a high level conceptual flow.

You can paste this PlantUML code in any PlantUML compatible editor/viewer to see the sequence diagram.

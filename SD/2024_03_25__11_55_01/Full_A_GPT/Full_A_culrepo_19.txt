Since I am an AI, I am unable to create diagrams directly. But I'm able to provide you with a textual format (syntax) that you can use to generate a Sequence Diagram in Plant UML. Please build your detailed Sequence Diagram according to this example:

```plantuml
@startuml
LibraryStaff -> Repository: Access Repository
activate Repository

Repository -> LibraryStaff: Provide available data
activate LibraryStaff

LibraryStaff -> Repository: Request statistics
activate Repository

Repository -> AnalyticsEngine: Fetch Statistics
activate AnalyticsEngine

AnalyticsEngine --> Repository: Return statistics
deactivate AnalyticsEngine

Repository --> LibraryStaff: Display Statistics
deactivate Repository
deactivate LibraryStaff

LibraryStaff -> AltmetricsEngine: Request Altmetrics at item level
activate AltmetricsEngine

AltmetricsEngine --> LibraryStaff: Return Altmetrics
deactivate AltmetricsEngine

LibraryStaff -> Service: Assess results
activate Service 

Service --> LibraryStaff: Return assessment results
deactivate LibraryStaff
deactivate Service
@enduml
```

In this example, the LibraryStaff interacts with the repository to request and display statistics, then requests item-level Altmetrics. After receiving this data, they perform an assessment of the results on the service. The interaction between LibraryStaff, Repository, AnalyticsEngine, AltmetricsEngine, and Service is depicted. Remember, the words and terms used can be replaced based on actual terms used in your project.

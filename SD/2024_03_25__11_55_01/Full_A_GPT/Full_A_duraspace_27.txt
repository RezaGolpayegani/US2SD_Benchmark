According to the provided user story, the following is a simple sequence diagram represented in Plant UML format.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "Repository System" as RS
participant "Object Lifecycle System" as OLS

RM -> RS : Request all events for an object
RS -> OLS : Forward request for all events
OLS -> OLS : Fetch all events for requested object
OLS --> RS : Return all events
RS --> RM : Display fetched events

@enduml
```
This sequence starts with the Repository Manager requesting the Repository System for all events associated with a specific object. The Repository System then forwards this request to the Object Lifecycle System which is responsible for maintaining the history of all objects. After fetching the relevant events for the requested object, the Object Lifecycle System returns this information to the Repository System which then shows these events to the Repository Manager.

Please note that this is a very simplified diagram and the actual details might vary based on how the systems are structured and how they interact with each other.

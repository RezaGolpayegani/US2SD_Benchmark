Since this is a text-based platform, I can't generate a diagram directly in this response. However, here is a step-by-step instruction for creating a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Manager
participant "Library System" as LS

Manager -> LS : RequestMissingBookNumbers()
activate LS
LS -> LS : RetrieveMissingBookNumbers()
note right : The system processes \nthe missing book numbers.
LS --> Manager : ReturnMissingBookNumbers()
note left: Manager gets \na list of missing book numbers
deactivate LS

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:

1. Manager will send a `RequestMissingBookNumbers()` message or command to the Library system.
2. The `Library System` receives this command and processes it using the `RetrieveMissingBookNumbers()` function.
3. The system identifies the list of missing book numbers.
4. The system then returns the list of missing book numbers through the `ReturnMissingBookNumbers()` response.
5. The manager gets the list of missing book numbers.

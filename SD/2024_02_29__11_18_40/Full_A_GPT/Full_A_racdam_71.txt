Sure, here is the sequence diagram for your user story in text format, convertible to a diagram via the Plant UML tool.

```
@startuml
title Cross-Collection Citation Information 

actor Researcher

Researcher -> CitationDB : requests citation information
activate CitationDB

CitationDB -> CollectionA : verifies citation availability
activate CollectionA
CollectionA --> CitationDB : returns citation status 
deactivate CollectionA

CitationDB -> CollectionB : verifies citation availability
activate CollectionB
CollectionB --> CitationDB : returns citation status 
deactivate CollectionB

CitationDB --> Researcher : provides cross-collection citation report
deactivate CitationDB

@enduml
```

This assumes that the researcher queries a database ("CitationDB"), which in turn checks two collections ("CollectionA" and "CollectionB") for the required citation information. After receiving responses from the collections, the database returns a combined report to the researcher.

I used simple names for the collections and the database, you can replace these with real components from your software system. Also, you can extend this diagram to include more collections or other relevant actors.

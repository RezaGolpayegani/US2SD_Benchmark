Below is a simple illustration of the sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on your user story:

```
@startuml
title Member Suggestions Sequence Diagram

actor Member
box "System"
participant "Suggestions System"
end box

Member -> "Suggestions System": Request for suggestions
activate "Suggestions System"

"Suggestions System" --> Member: Provide suggestions
deactivate "Suggestions System"

@enduml
```

Kindly replace the placeholders ("Member", "Suggestions System") with the actual names used in your project. Additionally, this is a very basic sequence diagram. The actual diagrm may include more complex interaction, including several other actors, components, or systems, and may involve more steps.

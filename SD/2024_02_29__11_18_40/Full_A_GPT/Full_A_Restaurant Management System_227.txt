Here is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram that represents the user story. Please note, this is a basic visual representation, practical applications might require more detailed or complex diagrams.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Restaurant Employee" as RE
participant "Order System" as OS
database "Database" as DB

RE -> OS : Request Active Orders
OS -> DB : Fetch Active Orders
DB --> OS : Return Order Data
OS --> RE : Display Orders by Start Date
@enduml
```
In the sequence, the restaurant employee sends a request to fetch active orders to the order system, which in turn fetches all active orders information from the database. The database returns the active orders data back to the order system, which then displays the orders to the restaurant employee, sorted by the start date.

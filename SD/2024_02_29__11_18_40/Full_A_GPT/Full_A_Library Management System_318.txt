Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram for a reader to comment on books:

```plain
@startuml
actor Reader
entity "Book Website" as BookWebsite
entity Database

Reader -> BookWebsite : Choose a book
BookWebsite -> Reader : Display Book Details
Reader -> BookWebsite : Write Comment 
BookWebsite -> Database : Save Comment 
Database --> BookWebsite : Confirm Save
BookWebsite --> Reader: Show Confirmation Message
@enduml
```

Please note: You'll need to paste this syntax into a Plant UML editor to generate the sequence diagram.

This sequence diagram assumes that the reader is interacting with a book website and there is a database where comments are saved. The reader chooses a book, sees the book details, writes a comment, and saves the comment through the book website. The database confirms that the comment is saved, and the confirmation message is shown to the reader.

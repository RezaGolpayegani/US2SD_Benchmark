Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram in Plant UML:

```
@startuml
actor User
participant "Library System" as LS
participant "Database" as DB

User -> LS : Search for Book1
activate LS
LS -> DB : Check book1 reservation status
activate DB
DB --> LS : Book1 is available
deactivate DB
LS --> User : Book1 is available for reservation
deactivate LS
User -> LS : Reserve Book1
activate LS
LS -> DB : Reserve Book1
activate DB
DB --> LS : Book1 reservation successful
deactivate DB
LS --> User : Book1 reservation successful
deactivate LS

User -> LS : Search for Book2
activate LS
LS -> DB : Check book2 reservation status
activate DB
DB --> LS : Book2 is available
deactivate DB
LS --> User : Book2 is available for reservation
deactivate LS
User -> LS : Reserve Book2
activate LS
LS -> DB : Reserve Book2
activate DB
DB --> LS : Book2 reservation successful
deactivate DB
LS --> User : Book2 reservation successful
deactivate LS

This sequence diagram needs to be translated into images by Plant UML tool. It's important to note that the level of detail can vary in sequence diagrams - code snippet above does not include certain things such as error handling (what if a book is not available?).

In the diagram:
1. The user searches for Book1 in the library system.
2. The library system checks the reservation status of Book1 in the Database.
3. If Book1 is available, the user reserves Book1 through the library system which updates the Database.
4. The same process is done for Book2.

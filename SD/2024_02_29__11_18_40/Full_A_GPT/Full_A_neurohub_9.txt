Sure, here is an example of a sequence diagram for your user story in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
title Create Log Book Page and Attach File Sequence Diagram

actor Researcher

box "Research System"
entity "Log Book Page" as lb
entity "File Attachment" as fa
end box

Researcher -> lb: createPage()
activate lb
lb --> Researcher: pageCreated()
deactivate lb

Researcher -> fa: attachFile(pageId, filePath)
activate fa
fa --> Researcher: fileAttached()
deactivate fa

@enduml
```

Here's what's happening in this sequence:

1. The Researcher sends a request (`createPage()`) to the "Log Book Page" entity to create a new page.
2. The "Log Book Page" entity responds with a `pageCreated()` signal confirming the page creation.
3. The Researcher then sends an `attachFile(pageId, filePath)` request to the "File Attachment" entity. This includes the ID of the page to attach the file to and the path of the file to attach.
4. The "File Attachment" entity confirms the file attachment with a `fileAttached()` signal.

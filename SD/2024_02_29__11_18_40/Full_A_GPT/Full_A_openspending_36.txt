Sure, here is the sequence diagram in Plant UML format which based on the user story above. It describes the interaction between "API User", "API Server" and "Database" for normalising measures by GDP.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "API User" as A
participant "API Server" as B
database "Database" as DB

A->B: Request Normalize Measures
activate B
B->DB: Get GDP Data
activate DB
DB-->>B: Return GDP Data
deactivate DB
B->DB: Get Measures Data
activate DB
DB-->>B: Return Measures Data
deactivate DB
B->B: Normalize Measures with GDP Data
B-->>A: Return Normalized Measures
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This diagram assumes the API Server interacts with the Database to firstly gather the GDP Data, then retrieve the Measures Data. After both sets of data have been obtained, the API Server normalises the Measures with the GDP Data before finally returning the Normalised Measures to the API User.

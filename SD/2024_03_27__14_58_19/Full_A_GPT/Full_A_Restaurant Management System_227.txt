To visualize the sequence of operations described in your user story using PlantUML, it's key to break down the actions and interactions among system components that occur when a restaurant employee wants to view all active orders, sorted by order start date. Below is a PlantUML diagram that depicts this sequence.

This diagram assumes the following workflow:

1. The restaurant employee interacts with the UI to request viewing of all active orders.
2. The UI sends this request to the backend server.
3. The server processes this request and queries the database to fetch all active orders.
4. The database returns the list of active orders.
5. The server sorts these orders by their start date.
6. The sorted list is sent back to the UI.
7. The UI displays the orders to the restaurant employee in the requested order.

Here is the PlantUML code to illustrate this sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant EmployeeUI as UI
participant Server
participant Database

UI -> Server : Request active orders
activate Server

Server -> Database : Fetch active orders
activate Database

Database --> Server : List of active orders
deactivate Database

Server -> Server : Sort orders by start date
Server --> UI : Sorted active orders

UI -> UI : Display orders to employee
deactivate Server
@enduml
```

To render this PlantUML sequence diagram, you would need to use a PlantUML environment or tool that supports PlantUML code (e.g., an online editor, an IDE plugin, or the PlantUML command-line tool).

This diagram simplifies the interaction for clarity and focuses on the main steps involved in the process based on the given user story. Depending on the specific implementation details or additional features of the Restaurant Management and Operations System, there might be additional steps or components involved in this process.

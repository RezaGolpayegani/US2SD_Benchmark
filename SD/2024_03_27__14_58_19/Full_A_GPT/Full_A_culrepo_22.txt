To create a sequence diagram for the given user story where a DB/IR (Database/Information Repository) administrator wants to access a list of subscribers for a specified report to investigate missing report complaints, we'll outline the interactions between the administrator, the digital repository system, and the database that likely stores subscriber information.

Note: This diagram outlines a basic flow and assumes the existence of a web-based interface for the administrator to interact with and a backend system capable of processing these requests.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "DB/IR Administrator" as Admin
participant "Web Interface" as Web
participant "Repository System" as System
database "Database" as DB

== User Story: Access Subscriber List for a Specific Report ==

Admin -> Web : Access Reports Section
Admin -> Web : Select Report to Investigate

Web -> System : Request Selected Report Details
System -> DB : Query Report Information
DB -> System : Return Report Information
System -> Web : Display Report Details

Admin -> Web : Request List of Subscribers
Web -> System : Query Subscribers for Report
System -> DB : Retrieve Subscribers List
DB -> System : Return Subscribers List
System -> Web : Display Subscribers List
Web -> Admin : Show Subscribers List

```

**Explanation:**

1. **DB/IR Administrator** initiates the process by accessing the reports section of the web interface and selecting a report to investigate.
2. The **Web Interface** sends a request to the **Repository System** for the details of the selected report.
3. The **Repository System** queries the **Database** for information on the report, which includes metadata and possibly the list of subscribers. The database returns this information.
4. The system then displays the report details through the web interface.
5. The administrator makes a request (through the web interface) to view the list of subscribers for the specified report. This action is usually triggered because of a need to investigate complaints about missing reports or access issues.
6. The **Repository System** queries the **Database** again, this time specifically for the list of subscribers associated with the report.
7. The **Database** returns the list of subscribers.
8. The **Repository System** processes this list and displays it to the administrator through the web interface.

This sequence diagram simplifies complex backend processes involving user management, access control, and perhaps more intricate interactions depending on system architecture and database schema. However, it captures the essence of the process in alignment with the provided user story.

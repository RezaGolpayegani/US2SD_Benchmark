To illustrate the sequence of events for assigning a unique identification number (ID) to a book from the perspective of a library manager in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), the following PlantUML code provides a detailed sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryManager as LM
participant WebInterface as WI
participant Server as S
participant Database as DB

LM -> WI : Accesses Book Management
activate WI
WI -> S : Request Book Assignment Form
activate S
S -> DB : Fetch Next Unique ID
activate DB
DB --> S : Unique ID
deactivate DB
S --> WI : Display Form with Unique ID
deactivate S
WI --> LM : Show Form
deactivate WI

LM -> WI : Submits New Book Details
activate WI
WI -> S : Send New Book Data with ID
activate S
S -> DB : Store New Book Information
activate DB
DB --> S : Confirmation
deactivate DB
S --> WI : Assignment Success
deactivate S
WI --> LM : Display Success Message
deactivate WI

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the library manager accessing the book management section through the web interface. The server then requests the next available unique ID from the database, which is then used to pre-fill the new book assignment form that is displayed to the library manager. Once the library manager submits the new book details, the information, including the unique ID, is sent back to the server to be stored in the database. A confirmation of successful assignment is then relayed back to the manager.

Please note, to render this diagram, you'll need a PlantUML environment or a compatible tool that supports PlantUML code.

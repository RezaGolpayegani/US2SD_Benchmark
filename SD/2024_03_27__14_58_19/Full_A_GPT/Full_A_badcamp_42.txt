Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the above user story involves illustrating the interactions between different system components and the summit coordinator when listing basic information about a summit. Below is a PlantUML syntax representation of these interactions. This example assumes the system includes components for summit coordinators (the user), a web interface, backend services (Controller), and a database.

This diagram does not show the client-side (browser) interaction with the web page itself but rather focuses on the server-side process after the summit coordinator submits the information about the summit.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Summit Coordinator" as coordinator
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Summit Controller" as controller
participant "Database" as db

coordinator -> web : Access summit information form
web -> coordinator : Display form

coordinator -> web : Submit summit information
web -> controller : Validate summit data

alt validation success
    controller -> db : Save summit information
    db -> controller : Confirm save
    controller -> web : Display success message
    web -> coordinator : Show confirmation
else validation failure
    controller -> web : Display error message
    web -> coordinator : Show error and request correction
end

Explanation:

1. **Summit Coordinator Accesses Form:** The summit coordinator initiates the process by accessing a form on the web interface designed to capture summit information.

2. **Display Form:** The web interface displays the form to the summit coordinator.

3. **Submit Summit Information:** After filling out the form, the summit coordinator submits the information.

4. **Validate Summit Data:** The submitted data is first validated by the controller (usually involving checks for completeness, correctness, and possibly security validations).

5. **Decision Point (Validation Success or Failure):**
   - If the data passes validation, the process moves to save the information in the database.
   - If the data fails validation, an error message is returned to the summit coordinator for correction.

6. **Save Summit Information:** Assuming validation is successful, the controller sends the summit information to be saved in the database.

7. **Confirm Save:** The database confirms the saving process.

8. **Show Confirmation or Error:** Finally, depending on the outcome of the validation, the coordinator is either shown a success message with confirmation or an error message requesting corrections.

This sequence ensures that the summit coordinator can list basic information about their summit efficiently, and it allows for validation to ensure that the information is correct, which helps maintain the integrity and usefulness of the platform for potential attendees.

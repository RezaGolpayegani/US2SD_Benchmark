Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story involves illustrating how different systems and roles interact to achieve the desired outcome: improving the accuracy of submission error messages for FABS users. To design this in PlantUML format, we need to detail interactions between the FABS User, Submission Interface, Validation Service, Error Handling System, and Feedback Mechanism.

Below is a PlantUML code snippet to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "FABS User" as User
participant "Submission Interface" as Interface
participant "Validation Service" as Validator
participant "Error Handling System" as ErrorHandler
participant "Feedback Mechanism" as Feedback

User -> Interface : Submit Data
activate Interface

Interface -> Validator : Validate Submission
activate Validator

alt Valid Data
    Validator -> Interface : Validation Success
    deactivate Validator

    Interface -> User : Success Message
    deactivate Interface
else Invalid Data
    Validator -> ErrorHandler : Report Errors
    activate ErrorHandler
    ErrorHandler -> Validator : Error Details
    
    Validator -> Interface : Validation Fail + Error Details
    deactivate Validator

    Interface -> Feedback : Format Error Messages
    activate Feedback
    Feedback -> Interface : Formatted Error Messages
    
    Interface -> User : Error Messages
    deactivate Interface
    deactivate Feedback
end

deactivate User

**Explanation of the Diagram:**

1. **FABS User submits data:** The process starts with the FABS user submitting their data through the Submission Interface.

2. **Submission Interface validates submission:** The submitted data is then passed to the Validation Service to check for any inconsistencies or errors.

3. **Validation Service checks the data:**
   - If the data is valid, the Validation Service informs the Submission Interface, which in turn notifies the user of the successful submission.
   - If the data is invalid, the Validation Service sends the error details to the Error Handling System.

4. **Error Handling System processes errors:** The Error Handling System processes and categorizes the errors before sending the details back to the Validation Service.

5. **Validation Service forwards errors:** With the processed errors, the Validation Service sends a validation failure notice along with error details to the Submission Interface.

6. **Feedback Mechanism formats error messages:** To ensure the FABS user understands the submission errors, the Submission Interface sends the errors to the Feedback Mechanism, which formats the error messages into a user-friendly format.

7. **FABS User receives error messages:** Finally, the formatted error messages are sent back to the FABS user through the Submission Interface.

This sequence diagram outlines the flow and interaction between different components from the moment a FABS user submits data to receiving feedback in case of errors. It emphasizes the importance of clear and accurate error reporting to improve user experience.

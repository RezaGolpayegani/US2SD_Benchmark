Given your requirement, below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines the process through which a data librarian extracts pointers from the DMP to metadata held in other systems for import into a data catalogue.

Please note, due to the text format's limitations, you'll need to interpret and adapt this sample code snippet within a PlantUML environment or any other tool that supports PlantUML for visualization.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
participant DataLibrarian as librarian
participant DMPTool
participant ExternalMetadataSystem as EMS
participant DataCatalogue

librarian -> DMPTool : Request metadata pointers
activate DMPTool
DMPTool -> EMS : Fetch metadata pointers
activate EMS
EMS --> DMPTool : Return metadata pointers
deactivate EMS
DMPTool --> librarian : Provide metadata pointers
deactivate DMPTool

librarian -> EMS : Request metadata using pointers
activate EMS
EMS --> librarian : Return detailed metadata
deactivate EMS

librarian -> DataCatalogue : Import metadata
activate DataCatalogue
DataCatalogue --> librarian : Confirm metadata import
deactivate DataCatalogue

In this diagram:
- **DataLibrarian** represents your role as the initiator of the process.
- **DMPTool** represents the comprehensive data management planning tool where the research data management plans are stored.
- **ExternalMetadataSystem (EMS)** symbolizes external systems from which metadata pointers are fetched. It's considered external to DMPTool and contains detailed metadata.
- **DataCatalogue** represents the system or repository where the imported metadata will reside for future access, analysis, or reporting purposes.

### Sequence Explained:

1. **Request Metadata Pointers**: The process begins with the data librarian requesting metadata pointers from the DMPTool.

2. **Fetch and Provide Metadata Pointers**: DMPTool then fetches these pointers from the External Metadata System (EMS) and provides them back to the data librarian.

3. **Request Metadata Using Pointers**: With metadata pointers at hand, the data librarian then requests the detailed metadata from the EMS.

4. **Import Metadata**: Finally, the librarian imports this detailed metadata into the Data Catalogue for consolidation, cataloguing, or further use.

This sequence diagram outlines a straightforward interaction for extracting and importing metadata. Depending on the complexity of your systems and requirements, additional steps or participants (like authentication systems or more detailed sub-processes) might be necessary for a real-world application.

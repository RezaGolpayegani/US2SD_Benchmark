To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story ("As a site admin, I want to edit and delete help wanted ads, so that I can correct small problems or make sure each ad complies with site guidelines.") using PlantUML, you need to consider the various interactions between the system components. This diagram will focus on the steps involved for a site admin to edit and delete job listings.

Please note, PlantUML code needs to be compiled to visualize the diagram (this can be done on PlantUML online editor or tools that support PlantUML syntax).

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Admin as A
participant "Admin Dashboard" as AD
participant "Database" as DB

== Edit Help Wanted Ad ==
A -> AD: Access "Help Wanted Ads" section
AD --> A: Displays existing ads

A -> AD: Select "Edit" on specific ad
AD -> DB: Fetch ad details
DB --> AD: Return ad details

AD --> A: Display ad details in editable form
A -> AD: Edit details and submit
AD -> DB: Update ad in database
DB --> AD: Confirm ad updated
AD --> A: Display success message

== Delete Help Wanted Ad ==
A -> AD: Access "Help Wanted Ads" section
AD --> A: Displays existing ads

A -> AD: Select "Delete" on specific ad
AD --> A: Prompt for confirmation

A -> AD: Confirm deletion
AD -> DB: Delete ad from database
DB --> AD: Confirm ad deleted
AD --> A: Display success message

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Edit Help Wanted Ad:**
   - The site admin accesses the help wanted ads section through the admin dashboard.
   - The existing ads are displayed.
   - The admin selects the "Edit" option for a specific ad, prompting the system to fetch the ad's details from the database.
   - The ad details are returned and displayed in an editable form to the admin.
   - The admin edits the details and submits them, leading the system to update the ad in the database.
   - A success message is displayed after the ad is updated.

2. **Delete Help Wanted Ad:**
   - As with editing, the admin accesses the help wanted ads section and existing ads are displayed.
   - The admin selects the "Delete" option for a specific ad, and a prompt for confirmation appears.
   - Upon confirmation, the system deletes the ad from the database and displays a success message.

This sequence diagram abstracts the process into main steps for clarity and may not cover all potential error handling and security checks (like authentication and authorization checks) that should be considered in a real-world application.

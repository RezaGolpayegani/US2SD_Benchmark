To create a PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story involving a repository manager who wants to view available versions of an object and restore a version from the staff interface in the context of the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS), follow the diagram syntax and logic closely. Here's a representation of the interaction between components in the system, including the repository manager, the staff interface, versioning system, and the repository itself.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant RepositoryManager as RM "Repository Manager"
participant StaffInterface as SI "Staff Interface"
participant VersioningSystem as VS "Versioning System"
participant Repository as Repo "Repository"

RM -> SI: Request available versions of an object
SI -> VS: Query available versions
VS -> Repo: Fetch version metadata
Repo --> VS: Return version metadata
VS --> SI: Display available versions
RM -> SI: Select version to restore
SI -> VS: Request version restoration
VS -> Repo: Restore selected version
Repo --> VS: Confirm restoration
VS --> SI: Display restoration success message
SI --> RM: Show restoration success and updated object version

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the repository manager requesting to view the available versions of a specific object through the staff interface. The staff interface then queries the versioning system for the available versions. The versioning system fetches this information from the repository, which returns the version metadata back to the versioning system. The available versions are then displayed to the repository manager through the staff interface.

Upon viewing the available versions, the repository manager decides to restore a specific version and makes the request through the staff interface. The staff interface forwards this request to the versioning system, which then instructs the repository to restore the selected version. After the repository confirms the restoration, the versioning system communicates this success back to the staff interface, which in turn, informs the repository manager. The diagram concludes with the repository manager receiving a success message and possibly viewing the updated version of the object.

This sequence diagram abstractly represents the actions and interactions required to view and restore object versions within the EDRMS, focusing on the roles of various components in the process as per the given user story.

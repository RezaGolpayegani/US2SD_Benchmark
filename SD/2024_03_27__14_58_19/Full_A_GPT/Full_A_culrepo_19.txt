Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the described user story involves illustrating the various interactions between a library staff member and the digital repository system components to access usage statistics and altmetrics. Below is the PlantUML code to represent these interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff" as staff
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Authentication Service" as auth
participant "Statistics Module" as stats
participant "Database" as db
participant "Altmetrics Service" as altmetrics

staff -> web : Access Statistics Page
web -> auth : Validate Access
auth -> web : Access Granted

group Retrieve Usage Statistics
    web -> stats : Request Statistics (repo, collection, author, item)
    stats -> db : Query Usage Data
    db -> stats : Return Usage Data
    stats -> web : Display Statistics
end

group Retrieve Altmetrics
    web -> altmetrics : Request Altmetrics (author, item)
    altmetrics -> db : Query Altmetrics Data
    db -> altmetrics : Return Altmetrics Data
    altmetrics -> web : Display Altmetrics
end

staff <- web : View Statistics and Altmetrics
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the library staff member accessing the statistics page via a web interface. The web interface then interacts with an authentication service to validate the access of the library staff. Once access is granted, the web interface requests usage statistics and altmetrics for specific repositories, collections, authors, or items.

The statistics module queries the database for usage data and returns this data to be displayed on the web interface. Similarly, for altmetrics, the web interface requests data from an altmetrics service, which in turn retrieves altmetrics data from the database. The database returns the requested altmetrics data, which gets displayed on the web interface. Finally, the library staff views the comprehensive usage statistics and altmetrics.

This diagram simplifies the complex interactions into a manageable visualization, focusing on the core processes related to the user story.

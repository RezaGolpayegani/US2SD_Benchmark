Sure, I'll craft a simplified PlantUML code snippet to illustrate the sequence diagram for the user story: "As a librarian, I want to update pages for book information." This diagram will depict the interactions between the librarian, the Library Management System's UI, the server, and the database when a librarian updates information about a book.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Librarian as librarian
participant "CLMS UI" as ui
participant "Server" as server
participant "Database" as db

librarian -> ui : Selects a book to update
ui -> server : Request book details
server -> db : Fetch book details
db -> server : Return book details
server -> ui : Display book details
ui -> librarian : Show book details

librarian -> ui : Inputs updated pages information
ui -> server : Submit update request

activate server
server -> db : Update book record with new pages
db -> server : Confirm update
deactivate server

server -> ui : Display update success message
ui -> librarian : Show success message

```

This sequence diagram walks through the following steps:

1. The librarian selects the specific book they want to update in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) user interface (UI).
2. The CLMS UI sends a request to the server to fetch the current details of the book.
3. The server retrieves the book details from the database.
4. The database returns the requested book details back to the server.
5. These details are then sent to the UI, which displays them to the librarian.
6. The librarian inputs the updated number of pages into the UI.
7. The UI submits this update to the server.
8. The server processes this request and updates the book's record in the database with the new pages information.
9. The database confirms the update to the server.
10. Finally, the server sends a success message back to the UI, which is displayed to the librarian, confirming that the book information has been successfully updated.

This is a high-level overview, and actual implementation might require handling additional logic such as authentication, validation, and error management.

Based on your project description and the specific user story, here is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram that represents the process an archivist would go through to restrict a file from view. This includes interactions between the archivist (user), the digital archive system interface, and internal system components responsible for managing access control and file metadata updates.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Archivist" as Archivist
participant "Digital Archive Interface" as Interface
participant "Access Control System" as AccessControl
participant "File Metadata Service" as MetadataService
participant "Database" as DB

Archivist -> Interface : Selects file to restrict
activate Interface

Interface -> MetadataService : Fetch file metadata
activate MetadataService

MetadataService -> DB : Query file details
activate DB
DB --> MetadataService : Return file metadata
deactivate DB

MetadataService --> Interface : Display file metadata
deactivate MetadataService

Archivist -> Interface : Request to apply restriction
activate Interface

Interface -> AccessControl : Process restriction request
activate AccessControl

AccessControl -> MetadataService : Update access level
activate MetadataService

MetadataService -> DB : Update file with restricted access
DB --> MetadataService : Confirm update
deactivate DB

MetadataService --> AccessControl : Confirm access updated
deactivate MetadataService

AccessControl --> Interface : Restriction applied successfully
deactivate AccessControl

Interface --> Archivist : Display success message
deactivate Interface

### Explanation:
1. **Archivist Selects File to Restrict:** The archivist initiates the process by selecting the specific file they wish to restrict via the digital archive interface.

2. **Fetch File Metadata:** The interface communicates with the File Metadata Service to fetch and display the current metadata of the selected file, including its current access level.

3. **Request to Apply Restriction:** After reviewing the file details, the archivist decides to apply the restriction and communicates this decision through the interface.

4. **Process Restriction Request:** The digital archive interface forwards this request to the Access Control System, which is responsible for managing and applying access restrictions.

5. **Update Access Level:** The Access Control System communicates with the File Metadata Service to update the metadata of the file, specifically its access level, to reflect the restriction.

6. **Confirm Access Updated:** The File Metadata Service updates the file's metadata in the database and confirms the update to the Access Control System. 

7. **Restriction Applied Successfully:** The Access Control System then confirms to the digital archive interface that the restriction has been applied successfully.

8. **Display Success Message:** Finally, the digital archive interface informs the archivist that the file has been successfully restricted.

This sequence diagram outlines the steps and interactions necessary for an archivist to restrict a file from view, ensuring that each component of the system operates in coordination to maintain data integrity and enforce access control policies.

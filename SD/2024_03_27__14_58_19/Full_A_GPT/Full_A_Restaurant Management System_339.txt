Creating a sequence diagram for the user story "As an employee, I want to enter customer reviews into the system with their consents" involves depicting the interactions between different components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. The sequence diagram will illustrate the flow from the moment an employee decides to enter a customer review until it is stored in the database, with emphasis on the consent verification process. 

Note that the exact implementation details may vary based on the project's existing architecture and the specifics of the technology stack chosen. Here's a simplified PlantUML code to visualize this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "Review Entry Interface" as Interface
participant "Consent Management Module" as Consent
database "Database" as DB

Employee -> Interface : Select "Enter Review"
Interface -> Employee : Prompt for review details and consent
Employee -> Interface : Provide review details and confirm consent
Interface -> Consent : Verify consent
alt Consent verified
    Consent -> Interface : Consent confirmed
    Employee -> Interface : Submit review
    Interface -> DB : Store review
    DB -> Interface : Confirmation
    Interface -> Employee : Show success message
else Consent not verified or declined
    Consent -> Interface : Consent denied
    Interface -> Employee : Show error message
end
@enduml
```

This sequence starts with the employee choosing to enter a review through the Review Entry Interface. The interface then prompts the employee to input the review details and confirm the customer's consent to share the review. Once the employee submits this information, the Consent Management Module verifies the consent. If consent is verified, the process continues with the review being submitted, stored in the database, and a success message being displayed to the employee. If the consent is not verified or declined, an error message is shown instead.

Remember, the level of detail and the components included can vary based on specific project requirements and system design decisions. For an actual project, each component (e.g., "Consent Management Module") would need to be further defined and aligned with the project's tech stack and architecture.

Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story: "As a moderator, I want to export a transcript of a game as an HTML file, so that I can save the stories and estimates locally." This diagram outlines the interactions between the system components involved in exporting a game transcript.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Moderator as mod
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend Server" as server
participant "Export Service" as export
participant "Database" as db
participant "File System" as fs

mod -> web: Selects "Export Game"
web -> server: Request export with gameID
server -> db: Query game data\n(gameID)
db --> server: Return game data
server -> export: Generate HTML transcript\ngame data
export --> server: HTML file
server -> fs: Save HTML file
fs --> server: File path
server -> web: Provide download link
web -> mod: Display download link
mod -> web: Clicks download link
web -> server: Request file\n(file path)
server -> fs: Retrieve HTML file\n(file path)
fs --> server: HTML file content
server --> web: Send HTML file
web --> mod: Start file download
mod -> fs: Save HTML file locally

This sequence diagram represents the process flow when a moderator wants to export a game transcript as an HTML file:

1. **Initiation:** The moderator selects the option to "Export Game" in the web interface.
2. **Request Processing:** The web interface sends a request to the backend server, passing the unique identifier of the game to be exported.
3. **Data Retrieval:** The backend server queries the database for the game data using the provided game ID.
4. **Export Generation:** With the game data retrieved, the backend server passes this data to the export service, which processes and generates an HTML transcript of the game.
5. **File Saving:** The generated HTML file is saved to the file system, and its path is returned to the backend server.
6. **Download Link Provision:** The backend server sends a download link for the HTML file back to the web interface, which then displays it to the moderator.
7. **File Download:** Upon clicking the download link, a request is made to retrieve the file, which is then downloaded and saved to the moderator's local file system.

Note: This scenario assumes the HTML file is temporarily stored on the server's file system and retrieved for download upon request. Depending on the system's design, alternative storage and retrieval methods might be employed.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a customer, I want to see the menu" involves illustrating the sequence of interactions between the customer, the user interface, backend systems, and the database. This example focuses on the online aspect of viewing the menu.

Below is a sequence diagram described in PlantUML format. This diagram depicts the process a customer goes through to view the menu in the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Customer
participant "UI: Web/App Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Server\n(Node.js with Express)" as Server
database "Database\n(MongoDB/PostgreSQL)" as DB

Customer -> UI: Clicks 'View Menu'
UI -> Server: GET request /api/menu
activate Server
Server -> DB: Query menu items
activate DB
DB --> Server: Return menu items
deactivate DB
Server --> UI: Menu items data
deactivate Server
UI --> Customer: Display menu
@enduml
```

This diagram follows these steps:
1. The `Customer` interacts with the system by clicking on a 'View Menu' option within the web or application interface (`UI: Web/App Interface`).
2. The UI makes a GET request to the backend server (`Backend Server (Node.js with Express)`) asking for the menu items.
3. The backend server then queries the database (`Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)`) for the menu item data.
4. The database returns the menu items to the backend server.
5. The backend server forwards this data to the UI.
6. Finally, the UI displays the menu to the `Customer`.

The specified technologies (React.js or Angular for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the server side, MongoDB or PostgreSQL for the database, and possibly AWS or Google Cloud for hosting) imply a modern web application architecture. The sequence diagram can be further detailed or adjusted based on actual implementation details such as API endpoint names, specific request-response models, and error handling mechanisms.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram code fragment that models the process of a library staff member ('StaffUser') checking out a book for a customer after reservation. This process involves interaction between the staff user, the system interface (‘LibrarySystem’), and back-end services such as ‘BookManagement’ and ‘ReservationSystem’. Assume here that the book has already been reserved by the customer and is now being checked out.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "StaffUser" as Staff
participant "LibrarySystem" as System
participant "ReservationSystem" as Reservation
participant "BookManagement" as Book
database "Database" as DB

Staff -> System: Request checkout interface
activate System
System --> Staff: Provide checkout interface

Staff -> System: Submit checkout form (BookID, UserID)
activate System

System -> Reservation: Verify reservation status(BookID, UserID)
activate Reservation
Reservation -> DB: Check reservation(BookID, UserID)
activate DB
DB --> Reservation: Reservation confirmed
deactivate DB
Reservation --> System: Reservation valid
deactivate Reservation

System -> Book: Process checkout(BookID, UserID)
activate Book
Book -> DB: Update book status (checked out)
activate DB
DB --> Book: Update successful
deactivate DB
Book --> System: Checkout processed
deactivate Book

System -> Reservation: Update reservation status (completed)
activate Reservation
Reservation -> DB: Mark reservation as completed(BookID, UserID)
activate DB
DB --> Reservation: Update successful
deactivate DB
Reservation --> System: Reservation updated
deactivate Reservation

System --> Staff: Display checkout confirmation
deactivate System

This diagram outlines the following steps in the checkout process after reservation:
1. The library staff member requests the checkout interface from the library system.
2. The library system provides the checkout interface to the staff member.
3. The staff member submits the checkout form with the necessary details (BookID, UserID).
4. The system verifies the reservation status with the reservation system.
5. The reservation system checks with the database to confirm the reservation is valid.
6. The library system processes the book checkout through book management.
7. Book management updates the book's status in the database as checked out.
8. The system updates the reservation status to completed through the reservation system.
9. The reservation system updates the booking status in the database.
10. The library system displays the checkout confirmation to the staff member.

Note that this diagram represents a high-level overview; real-world implementations might involve additional steps or systems such as payment processing if there are any associated fees or more detailed user authentication for security purposes.

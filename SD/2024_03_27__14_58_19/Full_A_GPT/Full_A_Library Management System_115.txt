To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a library manager, I want to create a book record so that I can add new books to the library," here's the PlantUML code that outlines the process flow from the library manager initiating a request to add a new book to the system, through the system verifying details and updating the database, to finally acknowledging the successful addition of the book. 

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Manager as M
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Verification Module" as VM
participant "Database" as DB

M -> UI : Select "Add New Book"
UI -> M : Display Add Book Form
M -> UI : Input Book Details\n(Title, Author, ISBN, etc.)
UI -> VM : Verify Book Details
alt Verification Successful
    VM -> UI : Verification Successful
    M -> UI : Confirm Book Addition
    UI -> DB : Add New Book Record
    DB -> UI : Acknowledge Record Addition
    UI -> M : Display Success Message
else Verification Failed
    VM -> UI : Error in Details
    UI -> M : Display Error Message\n(Request Correct Details)
end

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Manager to UI Interface**: The library manager (M) initiates the process by selecting the option to add a new book through the User Interface (UI).
2. **UI Interface to Manager**: The UI then displays a form for adding a new book to the manager.
3. **Manager Inputs Book Details**: The manager fills in the book details such as Title, Author, ISBN, and other relevant information and submits this information through the UI.
4. **UI to Verification Module**: The UI passes the book details to the Verification Module (VM) to verify the completeness and correctness of the book details.
5. **Verification Outcome**: 
   - If the verification is successful, the VM signals back to the UI that the book details are verified.
     - The manager confirms the book addition, and the UI sends a request to the Database (DB) to add the new book record.
     - The Database acknowledges the addition of the new record to the UI, which in turn displays a success message to the manager.
   - If the verification fails (e.g., missing or incorrect details), the VM sends an error message back to the UI, which informs the manager of the need to correct the details.
     - The process loops back to the manager inputting corrected book details.

This sequence diagram abstractly represents the flow of actions involved in adding a new book to the library's catalog by a library manager using the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

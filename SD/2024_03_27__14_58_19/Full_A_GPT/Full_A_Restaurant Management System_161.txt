To create a sequence diagram for the specified user story ("As a manager, I want to know the total sales and total profit so that I can determine the salaries of all employees.") using PlantUML, we'll outline the interactions among various components of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. Please note, to render PlantUML diagrams, you need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML diagrams.

For simplicity, the sequence will involve the Manager, the System (subsystems like Sales Management and Employee Management), and the Database. The sequence diagram will illustrate the process of retrieving total sales and total profit data necessary for determining employee salaries. 

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager
participant "Sales Management System" as SMS
participant "Employee Management System" as EMS
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> SMS: Request total sales and profit data
SMS -> DB: Query total sales and profit
DB --> SMS: Return sales and profit data
SMS --> Manager: Show total sales and profit
Manager -> EMS: Calculate salaries based on profits
EMS -> DB: Query employee data and performance
DB --> EMS: Return employee data
EMS --> Manager: Display calculated salaries
@enduml
```

This diagram shows the following steps:
1. The Manager requests the total sales and profit data from the Sales Management System.
2. The Sales Management System queries this data from the Database.
3. The Database returns the requested sales and profit data to the Sales Management System.
4. The Sales Management System displays the total sales and profit to the Manager.
5. With this information, the Manager then requests the Employee Management System to calculate employee salaries based on the profits.
6. The Employee Management System queries the Database for necessary employee data and performance metrics.
7. The Database returns the requested employee data to the Employee Management System.
8. Finally, the Employee Management System displays the calculated salaries to the Manager.

This sequence diagram provides a high-level view of how a manager could interact with the Restaurant Management and Operations System to obtain total sales and profit data, subsequently using this data to calculate employee salaries. It illustrates the connections between different components of the system focused on fulfilling the manager's needs. Keep in mind that for an actual implementation, additional details and steps might be required, especially concerning data security and error handling.

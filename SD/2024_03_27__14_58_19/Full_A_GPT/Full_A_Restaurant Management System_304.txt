To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a waiter, I want to see the orders" using PlantUML, you'll need to consider several key actors and systems involved in the process. This sequence diagram will outline the interaction between the waiter (the user), the front-end system (perhaps a tablet or computer), the backend server, and the database where orders are stored.

Below is an example of how this sequence diagram could be modeled in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter as waiter
participant "Frontend\n(UI)" as frontend
participant "Backend\nServer" as backend
database "Database" as db

waiter -> frontend: Request to view orders
frontend -> backend: GET /orders
backend -> db: Query orders for waiter
db -> backend: Return orders
backend -> frontend: Show orders data
frontend -> waiter: Display orders

@enduml
```

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:

1. **Waiter Requests to View Orders**: This step represents the waiter initiating the action to view orders, perhaps by clicking on a button or link in the application's UI.

2. **Frontend to Backend**: The frontend system sends a request to the backend server to fetch the orders. This is usually done via an HTTP GET request to a specific endpoint, for example, `/orders`.

3. **Backend Queries Database**: The backend receives the request and queries the database for the orders associated with the waiter. This step involves executing a database query to fetch relevant order data.

4. **Database Returns Orders**: The database processes the query and returns the result set, containing the orders, back to the backend server.

5. **Backend to Frontend**: The backend server processes the data, perhaps formatting or filtering it as necessary, and sends it back to the frontend system.

6. **Display Orders to Waiter**: Finally, the frontend system displays the fetched orders to the waiter, completing the process.

This sequence captures the primary interactions for the user story "As a waiter, I want to see the orders." Keep in mind, in a real-world application, there might be additional complexities, such as authentication and authorization, error handling, and data caching, which aren't detailed in this simplified example.

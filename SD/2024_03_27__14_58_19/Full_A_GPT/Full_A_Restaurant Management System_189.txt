Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the specific user story, "As a manager, I want to see the customer satisfaction ratio," involves illustrating the interactions between the manager, the Restaurant Management and Operations System, and any pertinent subsystems or services involved in gathering, calculating, and presenting the customer satisfaction data. Given the complexity of such systems, the sequence will emphasize the main steps rather than incorporating every potential detail or variation.

Please note that the syntax provided here should be processed by a PlantUML compiler to visualize the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Web Interface" as W
participant "Backend/API" as B
participant "Database" as D
participant "Analytics Service" as A

M -> W : Requests customer satisfaction data
W -> B : Fetch satisfaction ratio
B -> D : Retrieve customer feedback
D --> B : Customer feedback data
B -> A : Calculate satisfaction ratio
A --> B : Satisfaction ratio
B --> W : Display satisfaction ratio
W --> M : Shows satisfaction ratio

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Manager Requests Data:** The sequence starts with the manager requesting customer satisfaction data, reflecting the need to view the satisfaction ratio as stated in the user story.

2. **Web Interface to Backend/API:** The request is then forwarded from the web interface to the backend or API of the Restaurant Management and Operations System. This reflects the use of React.js or Angular for the frontend interacting with Node.js + Express for the backend, as outlined in the technology stack.

3. **Data Retrieval from Database:** The backend initiates a query to the database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to retrieve customer feedback data. This step incorporates accessing stored feedback, comments, and potentially ratings provided by the customers.

4. **Feedback Data Received:** The database returns the customer feedback data to the backend.

5. **Calculate Satisfaction Ratio:** The backend sends this data to an analytics service (a component of the backend logic or a third-party service integrated into the system) to calculate the satisfaction ratio. This involves analyzing feedback to produce a quantifiable metric reflecting overall customer satisfaction.

6. **Satisfaction Ratio Calculated:** The analytics service returns the calculated satisfaction ratio to the backend.

7. **Display Data on Web Interface:** The backend sends this satisfaction ratio data to the web interface, which prepares it for display.

8. **Manager Views Data:** Finally, the satisfaction ratio is presented to the manager through the web interface, successfully fulfilling the user story's requirement.

This sequence diagram captures the essential interactions involving the manager's request to view the customer satisfaction ratio, demonstrating how integrated systems work within the Restaurant Management and Operations System to deliver critical insights to managerial staff.

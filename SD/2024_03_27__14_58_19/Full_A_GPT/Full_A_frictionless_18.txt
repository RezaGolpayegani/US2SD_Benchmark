Creating a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format that illustrates the process a developer goes through to get a Data Package into Clojure promptly involves outlining the interactions between the developer and various system components of the DataPackage Integrator and Enhancer (DPIE) project. The sequence below visualizes these interactions focusing on key steps such as selecting a Data Package, invoking the DPIE API, and integrating the package into a Clojure environment for analysis and visualization.

Please note, actual implementation details may vary based on the DPIE project's specific API design and the environment setup. This example provides a conceptual overview.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber

actor Developer
participant "DPIE Portal" as Portal
participant "DPIE API" as API
participant "Clojure Environment" as Clojure
database "Data Package Repository" as Repo

Developer -> Portal : Search/select Data Package
Portal -> Repo : Query available Data Packages
Repo -> Portal : Return Data Package options
Portal -> Developer : Display Data Package options
Developer -> Portal : Choose specific Data Package
Portal -> Developer : Provide Data Package ID/URL
Developer -> API : Request Data Package (ID/URL)
API -> Repo : Fetch specified Data Package
Repo -> API : Return Data Package
API -> Developer : Provide Data Package\n(in Clojure compatible format)
Developer -> Clojure : Integrate Data Package
Clojure -> Developer : Data Package ready for analysis & visualization

In this sequence diagram:

1. **Developer**: Initiates the process by searching for or selecting the Data Package they need from the DPIE Portal.
2. **DPIE Portal**: Acts as an interface for the developer to find and select Data Packages stored in the Data Package Repository.
3. **Data Package Repository**: Stores various Data Packages that can be queried and fetched.
4. **DPIE API**: Acts as a bridge between the developer's request for a Data Package and the repository. It also ensures the Data Package is returned in a Clojure-compatible format.
5. **Clojure Environment**: Where the Data Package is finally integrated for analysis and visualization purposes.

This diagram abstracts many details intentionally to focus on the high-level flow according to the given user story. Depending on the project's specific implementation details, additional steps or participants (e.g., authentication and authorization mechanisms, specific internal APIs for data conversion) might be needed.

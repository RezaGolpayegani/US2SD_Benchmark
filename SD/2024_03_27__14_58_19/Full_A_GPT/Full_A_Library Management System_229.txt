To create a detailed sequence diagram for the user story of a manager wanting to track new books added to the current collection monthly to see the collection size, we'll use the PlantUML syntax. This sequence diagram will include interactions between the manager (as the user), the Library Management System (LMS) interface, the Book Management Module (which is part of LMS), and the Database.

Please note that PlantUML code can be run in a PlantUML environment or compatible tool to generate the sequence diagram. If you're not familiar with how to set up PlantUML, various online tools and IDE plugins provide easy ways to visualize PlantUML diagrams directly from the code.

```plantuml

actor Manager as manager
participant "LMS Interface" as interface
participant "Book Management\nModule" as bookModule
database "Database" as database

== Tracking New Books ==

manager -> interface: Access Book Tracking Function
activate manager
activate interface

interface -> bookModule: Request Monthly New Books Report
activate bookModule

bookModule -> database: Query New Books (Monthly)
activate database

database --> bookModule: Return New Books Data
deactivate database

bookModule --> interface: Display Monthly New Books Report
deactivate bookModule

interface --> manager: Show Monthly New Books

This PlantUML sequence diagram represents the flow of actions for a manager tracking new books added to the library's collection monthly. The steps are as follows:

1. **Manager initiates:** The manager accesses the book tracking function on the Library Management System (LMS) interface.
2. **LMS Interface processes the request:** The request for a monthly new books report is passed from the interface to the Book Management Module.
3. **Book Management Module queries the database:** This module makes a query to the database to fetch data on new books added in the specified month.
4. **Database returns data:** The database returns the data on new books to the Book Management Module.
5. **Book Management Module processes data:** After receiving the data, it's formatted appropriately (if necessary) and passed back to the interface.
6. **LMS Interface displays the report:** Finally, the monthly new books report is displayed to the manager through the interface.

This diagram can be adjusted or extended based on additional requirements, such as filtering options for the report, interfacing with external data sources, or integrating with notification systems to automatically alert managers about the new book statistics.

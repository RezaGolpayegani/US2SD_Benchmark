As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I cannot directly draw diagrams. However, I can provide you with the PlantUML code for the sequence diagram based on your user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Book Information System" as BIS
database "Book Database" as BD

Librarian -> BIS: Update Book Info Request
activate BIS

BIS -> BD: Request for Book Info
activate BD

BD --> BIS: Return Book Info
deactivate BD

BIS --> Librarian: Show Book Info
Librarian -> BIS: Enter New Info

BIS -> BD: Update Book Info
activate BD

BD --> BIS: Confirm Book Info Updated
deactivate BD

BIS --> Librarian: Show Update Confirmation
deactivate BIS
@enduml
```

This sequence first starts with the Librarian sending a request to update book info to the Book Information System. The System then sends a request to the book database to retrieve the current book info. Once the info is returned and shown to the Librarian, the Librarian can enter new info. This new info is sent to the database to be updated. Once the database confirms that the update was successful, this confirmation is shown to the librarian. 

Please note that you will need to paste the above code in a PlantUML environment to see the diagram.

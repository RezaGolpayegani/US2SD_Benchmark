   S->S: Selects random book from database
end

What this diagram represents is the sequence of interactions between the member, the system, and the librarian. The member makes a request for book suggestions which the system fulfills by selecting random books from the database, then it returns the suggestions to the member. After that, the member can ask the librarian for more details about the recommended books.

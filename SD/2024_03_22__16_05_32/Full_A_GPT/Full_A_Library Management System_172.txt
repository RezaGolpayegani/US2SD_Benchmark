Here's a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to reserve more than one book" using PlantUML syntax:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Member
actor Librarian
database LibraryDatabase

note over Member, Librarian: Member wants to reserve \nmultiple books.

Member -> LibraryDatabase: Search by book title
LibraryDatabase --> Member: Display search results

alt Book exists in database
    Member -> LibraryDatabase: Select and reserve book
    LibraryDatabase -> LibraryDatabase: Check book availability
    alt Book is available
        LibraryDatabase --> Member: Confirm book reservation
        note over Member: Member can repeat \nthis process to reserve \nanother book.
    else Book is not available
        LibraryDatabase --> Member: Inform book is currently unavailable
    end
else Book does not exist in database
    LibraryDatabase --> Member: Inform no such book exists
end

Member -> Librarian: Checkout reserved books
Librarian -> LibraryDatabase: Verify reservations and update book status
LibraryDatabase --> Librarian: Confirm book status update

Librarian --> Member: Confirm checkout and provide return date
note over Member: Member has now reserved \nand checked out multiple books.

This diagram just talks about the interaction for reserving and checking out multiple books. It does not consider the additional descriptions given later on (like adding new books, suggesting books etc.). Each of those need to be handled in a separate user story and their own sequence diagrams.

Please note: If you want to generate a graphical representation of the above PlantUML sequence diagram, you need to use a PlantUML viewer or an IDE plugin which supports PlantUML.

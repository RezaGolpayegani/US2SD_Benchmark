Here's how you can create your Sequence Diagram using PlantUML Format.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Normalize Measures By GDP

actor APIUser as u
entity Dataset as d
entity PlatformAdmin as p

== API User Request ==
u -> d: Request dataset
activate d
d -> u: Provide dataset
deactivate d 

== Normalize ==
u -> d: Normalize measure by GDP
activate d
d -> u: Normalized dataset
deactivate d 

== Management Actions ==
u -> p : View all published datasets
activate p 
p -> u: Provide datasets view
deactivate p 

== Map Query ==
u -> d: Query maps 
activate d
d -> u: Matches to map query
deactivate d

@enduml
``` 

This sequence diagram first depicts the action where the API User requests a dataset and has it processed. The next portion shows the normalization of measures by GDP. This normalized dataset is then sent back to the API User. The user then requests to view all published datasets, is fulfilled by the Platform Admin. Lastly, the user queries maps, which responds back with the matches to the map query.

Note - The above PlantUML does not recognize narrative descriptions, it only captures functional tasks and interactions between different entities.

This sequence diagram depicts the flow of entering a customer review to the system by an employee with customer's consent. The sequence begins with the employee logging into the system, followed by entering the review details. The system then asks for customer consent, which is obtained by the employee and the review is submitted with the consent. Finally, a confirmation of review submission is given by the system.

Please ensure that you will edit the function names or actions as per your system's architecture or code.

Sure, Here's an initial attempt to create a sequence diagram for your user story using PlantUML syntax. Note that it might need to be adapted according to the exact flows and interactions of your system.

```plantuml
@startuml

title Researcher - Cross-collection Citation Information

actor Researcher
boundary System
database Collection
database CitationDB
 
Researcher -> System: Request/Query cross-collection citation
activate System
System -> Collection: Fetch relevant collections
activate Collection
Collection --> System: Collections Data
deactivate Collection
System -> CitationDB: Fetch corresponding citations
activate CitationDB
CitationDB --> System: Citation Data
deactivate CitationDB
System --> Researcher: Present data in structured citation format
deactivate System

@enduml
```


In this sequence diagram, it assumes that collection data is stored in a separate "collection" database, and citation information is stored in another "citation" database, which may not fully reflect your actual organization of data. Make sure to adjust it appropriately to your specific situation.

Additionally, this represents a relatively simplified flow without error handling or other complexities. More complexities can be added as needed.

This script should be used with a PlantUML compiler to generate a sequence diagram. You can find one in several online diagram-making tools or install it locally to your machine.

Please note that the accuracy of this diagram heavily relies on the detailed description of the system and processes.

This sequence diagram is based on the user story of a researcher wanting to find cross-collection citation information for re-finding materials. If you want sequence diagrams for the other user stories, those would need to be developed separately.

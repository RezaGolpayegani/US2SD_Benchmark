Below is a suggested PlantUML script to generate your Sequence Diagram.

```PlantUML
@startuml
title Paper Sharing Repository in Neurohub

actor Researcher1 as "Researcher 1"
actor Researcher2 as "Researcher 2"
participant Repository as "Repository"

Researcher1 -> Repository: UploadPaper()
activate Repository

Repository --> Researcher1: ConfirmUpload()
deactivate Repository

Researcher1 -> Repository: SharePaper()
activate Repository

Database -> Researcher2: NotificationSharePaper()
deactivate Repository

Researcher2 -> Repository: ViewPaper()
activate Repository

Repository --> Researcher2: ShowPaper()

Researcher2 -> Repository: AddReviewComments()
activate Repository

Repository --> Researcher2: ConfirmReviewComments()
deactivate Repository

Researcher2 -> Repository: ShareReviewComments()
activate Repository

Repository -> Researcher1: NotificationReviewComments()
deactivate Repository

This diagrams show the sequence of interactions between two researchers and repository when uploading, sharing and reviewing papers or comments. 

This sequence begins when Researcher 1 uploads a paper to the repository which in turn confirms the upload. Researcher 1 then shares the paper which results in Researcher 2 receiving a notification about the shared paper. Then, Researcher 2 can view the paper, add review comments, get such an action confirmed and finally share the review comments. Researcher 1 is notified of the shared comments in the end. 

You can modify the diagram or the script as per the specifics of your project.

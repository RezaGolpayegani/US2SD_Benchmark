Here is the sequence Diagram in Plant UML format: 

```plantuml
@startuml
title "Object's Life Cycle"

actor RepositoryManager as R
participant DAMSystem as D
database ObjectLifeCycle as O

R -> D : Request Info (ObjectID)
activate D
D -> O : Search Object in Database(ObjectID)
activate O
O --> D : Return Object History
deactivate O
D --> R : Provide Object History
deactivate D

```

In this sequence diagram, the repository manager requests the information about an object's life cycle from the DAM system. The system then searches for the object in the database. Once the information is found, it is returned to the system and then provided to the repository manager.

NOTE: 

1. RepositoryManager is an actor who interacts with the DAM system.
2. DAMSystem, which stands for Digital Asset Management System, is the system used by the repository manager.
3. ObjectLifeCycle is the database where all the information about an object's life cycle is stored.
4. ObjectID is a representative name for an object given by the repository manager. This could be an alphanumeric code or similar identifier.

The activations and deactivations in the diagram represent the start and end of a process. Here, DAMSystem activation represents the process of fetching the details about an object. It gets deactivated after the process is complete. Similar is the case with ObjectLifeCycle. 

This is a very basic sequence diagram to get the object's life cycle events in the system. Based on the specifics and complexity, this can be further modified.

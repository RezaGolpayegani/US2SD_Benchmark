Based on your project description, a sequence diagram could look like this:

**Note:** This is a textual representation in PlantUML format. PlantUML is a component that allows you to write the UML diagram using a simple and intuitive language. You will need a PlantUML viewer to transform this code into an actual diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Reader" as R
participant "Website" as W
participant "Database" as D
participant "Librarian" as L

R -> W : Search for book by title
W -> D : Check if book is available
D --> W : Return book info
W --> R : Display book details
R -> W : Write a comment on book
W -> D : Save comment
D --> W : Confirm saving
W --> R : Confirm comment posting

L -> W : Add book to list
W -> D : Add book to database
D --> W : Confirm book addition
W --> L : Confirm book added to list

L -> W : Request random book suggestion
W -> D : Get random book details
D --> W : Return random book details
W --> L : Show random book suggestion

```

This sequence diagram reflects the described user story and the operations of searching for a book, commenting on a book, adding a new book, and getting a random book suggestion. It also shows the interaction between the reader, the website, the database, and the librarian.

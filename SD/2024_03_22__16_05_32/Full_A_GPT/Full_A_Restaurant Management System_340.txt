Here is the diagram in PlantUML syntax:

```
@startuml
actor Employee

box "Restaurant Management System"
participant "Order System"
participant "Note System"
end box

Employee -> OrderSystem: Select Order
activate OrderSystem

OrderSystem --> Employee: Show Selected Order
Employee -> NoteSystem: Enter Note for Selected Order
activate NoteSystem

NoteSystem --> OrderSystem: Add Note to Selected Order
deactivate NoteSystem

OrderSystem --> Employee: Confirm Note Added
deactivate OrderSystem

@enduml
```
You can simply paste the code above in PlantUML online viewer to see your sequence diagram. 

The process: 
1. Employee selects the order he wants to add notes to, this request goes to the Order System.
2. Order System returns the selected order details to the Employee. 
3. Employee writes down the note and sends it to the Note System for the previously selected order. 
4. Note System receives this request for adding the note and updates the relevant order in the Order System and then a confirmation of added note returns back to the Employee via the Order System.

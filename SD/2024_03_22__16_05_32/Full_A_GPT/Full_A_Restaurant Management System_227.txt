Here is the Plant UML sequence diagram for the mentioned user story:

```
@startuml
participant "Restaurant Employee" as A
participant "Restaurant Management System" as B
participant "Order Database" as C

A -> B: Request active orders
B -> C: Fetch active orders
C --> B: Return active orders
B --> A: Display active orders in order of start date
@enduml
```

This diagram represents the following interaction:

1. The Restaurant Employee (A) requests to see all active orders from the Restaurant Management System (B).
2. The Restaurant Management System (B) sends a fetch request to the Order Database (C) for all active orders.
3. The Order Database (C) returns the information for all active orders back to the Restaurant Management System (B).
4. The Restaurant Management System (B) displays the list of active orders, sorted by order start date, to the Restaurant Employee (A).

This sequence diagram captures the essence of the user story you provided and shows the sequence of events that would occur when the user story is executed. As you have not provided information about possible exceptions or alternative paths, this diagram only represents the main flow.

Sure, here is a basic Plant UML sequence diagram for the user story you provided. Please note that you need to adapt this diagram according to your exact requirements.

```plantuml
@startuml
Title Generating Recommendations for a Member

actor Member as m
participant "Recommendation\nSystem" as r
database "Recommendation\nDatabase" as d

m -> r: Request for suggestions
r -> d: Fetch suggestions
d --> r: Return suggestions
r --> m: Display suggestions
@enduml
```

This diagram says:

1. The Member (user) requests suggestions from the Recommendation System.
2. The Recommendation System fetches the suggestions from the Recommendation Database.
3. The Database returns the gathered suggestions (this could be based on the user's habits, previous interactions, etc.).
4. The Recommendation System then displays the fetched suggestions to the user (Member).

Make sure to replace the actors and operations to make it suitable for your project.

Sure, below is a PlantUML diagram in text format that describes the flow for updating book information.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "Book Database" as DB

Librarian -> DB : Get book info (bookID)
activate DB
DB --> Librarian : Returns book info (title, author, description, etc.)
deactivate DB

alt New book info
    Librarian -> DB : Send updated book info
    activate DB
    DB --> Librarian : Returns update status
    deactivate DB
else Nothing changed
    Librarian --> Librarian : Discard
end
@enduml
```

The sequence diagram involves the Librarian (the actor initiating the action) and the Book Database (object where the action is performed). The process begins with retrieving the book's current information, which the system returns to the Librarian. The Librarian may then send updated book information. In the end, the system confirms that the update has been made. Optionally, if there are no changes to the book details, the updated info can be overlooked.

Below is the sequence diagram in Plant UML format. Kindly verify and edit in accordance to your requirements:

```plantuml
@startuml
Actor "Restaurant Employee" as employee

box "Restaurant System"
    participant "Active Order System" as order
end box

employee -> order: Request list of active orders
activate order

order -> order: Fetch active orders
activate order
deactivate order

order --> employee: Display active orders sorted by start date
deactivate order

@enduml
```

This above PlantUML code will generate a sequence diagram which shows the interaction between the restaurant employee and the active order system of the restaurant. The employee requests the list of all active orders, the order system fetches and organizes these orders in order by start date, and then displays this list back to the employee.

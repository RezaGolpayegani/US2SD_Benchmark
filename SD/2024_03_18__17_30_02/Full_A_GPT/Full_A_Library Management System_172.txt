Here is a basic example of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for your user story:

```
@startuml
participant "LibraryMember" as LM
participant "LibrarySystem" as LS
participant "LibraryDatabase" as LD

LM->LS: MakeBookReservation(book1)
activate LS
LS->LD: CheckBookAvailability(book1)
activate LD
LD-->LS: RespondBookAvailability(book1)
deactivate LD
LS-->LM: ConfirmReservation(book1)

LM->LS: MakeBookReservation(book2)
activate LS
LS->LD: CheckBookAvailability(book2)
activate LD
LD-->LS: RespondBookAvailability(book2)
deactivate LD
LS-->LM: ConfirmReservation(book2)

```
In this sequence diagram, a library member interacts with a library system to make a reservation. The library system then checks with the library database about the availability of the book. If the book is available, the system confirms the reservation to the library member. This process repeats for each book the library member wants to reserve.

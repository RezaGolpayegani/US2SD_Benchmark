Here is your sequence diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence diagram presumes that there is an Authentication process for a user to log in and comment:

```plantuml
@startuml
User -> System: Open application
System --> User: Display login page
User -> System: Enter credentials
System --> User: Display dashboard
User -> System: Select book 
System --> User: Display book details
User -> System: Click Comment button
System --> User: Open comment form
User -> System: Write comment
System --> Database: Save comment
Database --> System: Return confirmation
System --> User: Display confirmation message
@enduml
```
In this diagram, the user interacts with the system (in this case, your application), and the system responds firstly by displaying the login page, then the dashboard and then the details of the book selected by the user. The user then clicks the Comment button, writes their comment, and the system saves the comment to the database. The database returns a confirmation to the system, and the system displays a confirmation message to the user.

Please consider to adjust the flow according to your system design and requirement.

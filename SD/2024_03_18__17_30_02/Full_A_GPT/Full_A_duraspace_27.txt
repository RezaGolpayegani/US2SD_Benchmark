Sure! Here's a simple sequence diagram based on your story, although the details could vary depending on the system you're picturing:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as manager
participant "Repository System" as system
participant "Object Lifecycle" as lifecycle

manager -> system : Request events for object
activate system
system -> lifecycle : Get events
activate lifecycle
lifecycle --> system: Return list of events
deactivate lifecycle
system --> manager: Show list of events
deactivate system
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, `Repository Manager` requests object events from `Repository System`, which retrieves them from `Object Lifecycle` and then returns the information to the `Repository Manager`. 

Please customize this diagram to your specific needs by adding the relevant classes or collaboration of classes and the causal relationships between them.

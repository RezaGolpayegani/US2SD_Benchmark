Sure, here is the sequence diagram for your user story in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Site Admin" as A
entity "Web Interface" as I
database "Ad Database" as D

A -> I : Navigate to Ad
activate I
I -> D : Retrieve Ad Information
activate D
D --> I : Return Ad Information
deactivate D
I --> A : Display Ad Information
deactivate I
A -> I : Request Edit/Delete Ad
activate I
I -> D : Edit/Delete Ad
activate D
D --> I : Confirm Success
deactivate D
I --> A : Show success message
deactivate I
@enduml
```

To explain this sequence in steps:

1. Site Admin navigates to the ad.
2. This initiates the Web Interface to retrieve the ad information from the Ad Database.
3. The Ad Information is then returned by the Database and shown to the Admin by the Web Interface.
4. If Admin requests an edit or delete operation to the Ad, it gets processed by the Interface and is executed in the Ad Database.
5. The Database then confirms the success of the operation.
6. Finally, a success message is returned to the site admin.

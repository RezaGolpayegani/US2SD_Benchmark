Sure, let's define the actors as: API User (you), API Service and GDP Service for fetching GDP data.

```plantuml

title API User Sequence Diagram 

actor "API User" as user
participant "API Service" as service
participant "GDP Service" as gdp

user -> service : Send Request to normalise measures 
activate service
service -> gdp : Fetch GDP data
activate gdp
gdp -->> service : Return GDP data 
deactivate gdp
service -> service : Calculate normalisation
service -->> user : Return normalised measures 
deactivate service

```

To briefly explain the diagram:

1. First, the API User sends a request to the API Service to normalise measures.
2. API Service becomes active and sends a request to GDP Service to fetch GDP data.
3. GDP Service returns the requested GDP data to the API Service and becomes inactive.
4. API Service calculates the normalisation using the acquired GDP data.
5. Finally, the API Service returns the normalised measures to the API User and becomes inactive.

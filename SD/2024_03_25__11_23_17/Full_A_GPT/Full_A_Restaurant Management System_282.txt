Unfortunately, as a text-based interface, I'm unable to create or display UML diagrams or any kind of visual content. However, I can certainly help you construct the instructions to create the diagram in the Plant UML language.

It might look something like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter

boundary "Order System" as OS
database "Order Database" as DB

== Deselecting Order Item ==
Waiter -> OS : Deselects order item
activate OS
OS -> DB : Sends request to deselect item
activate DB
DB --> OS : Returns confirmation
deactivate DB
OS --> Waiter : Shows confirmation
deactivate OS

@enduml
```

In this diagram:

- The "Waiter" represents the user, or in this case, the waiter.
- The "Order System" is the interface that the waiter is interacting with.
- The "Order Database" is the system that the order data is stored in.
- The arrows represent the action performed and the direction of the communication.

This sequence starts with the Waiter deselecting an item in the Order System. The Order System then sends a request to deselect the item to the Order Database. Once the Database completes this task, it sends a confirmation back to the Order System, which in turn, shows the confirmation to the Waiter.

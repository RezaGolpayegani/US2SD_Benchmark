Here is a detailed sequence diagram coded in Plant UML based on the User Story given:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee
entity OrderSystem
database NotesDatabase

Employee -> OrderSystem : Enter order id
OrderSystem --> Employee : Display order Details

Employee -> OrderSystem : Enter notes
OrderSystem --> OrderSystem : Validity check
OrderSystem -> NotesDatabase : Save notes for order
NotesDatabase --> OrderSystem : Successfully saved
OrderSystem --> Employee : Confirm notes submission
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, we have the "Employee" (the user), the "OrderSystem" (the system where the user operates), and the "NotesDatabase" (the database where notes details will be saved).

The workflow in the diagram goes as follows:

1. The Employee enters the order id into the OrderSystem.
2. The OrderSystem then displays the order details to the Employee.

3. The Employee proceeds to enter notes into the OrderSystem.
4. The OrderSystem performs some validity checks.

5. If the entered notes passes the validity check, the OrderSystem saves the notes for the order into the NotesDatabase.
6. NotesDatabase confirms back to the OrderSystem that the notes have been successfully saved.

7. Finally, the OrderSystem confirms to the User (Employee) that the notes submission was successful.

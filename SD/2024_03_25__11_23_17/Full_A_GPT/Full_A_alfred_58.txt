On the assumption that ALFRED is a smart device with capabilities of voice recognition, motions detection and can connect to the internet to send notifications:

**Sequence diagram description:**

1. The user, referred to as 'OlderPerson', triggers ALFRED, the smart device, with usual movement.
2. The smart device employs it's loT sensor to detect the movement which tracked as a regular movement.
3. In case of a fall, the device's sensor detects this irregular behavior and triggers a fall detection command.
4. ALFRED then attempts to communicate with the user to confirm the situation.
5. This is done by sending an audio message, "We detected a fall, are you okay?" 
6. If the user responds within a certain timeframe with "I'm okay", the process stops here.
7. However, if the user doesn't respond within a given timeframe, ALFRED registers it as a potential emergency. 
8. ALFRED initiates a command to send an emergency message to the specified contact provided by the user. 

```
@startuml
OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Regular movement
ALFRED -> Sensor : Detects regular movement

alt Fall Detected
  OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Fall
  ALFRED -> Sensor : Detects irregular movement
  ALFRED --> OlderPerson : Ask "We detected fall, are you okay?"
  OlderPerson -->ALFRED : No response
  ALFRED -> ALFRED : Initiate emergency contact protocol
  ALFRED -> Internet : Send emergency alert to specific contact
else No Fall Detected
  OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Regular movement
  ALFRED -> Sensor : Detect regular movement

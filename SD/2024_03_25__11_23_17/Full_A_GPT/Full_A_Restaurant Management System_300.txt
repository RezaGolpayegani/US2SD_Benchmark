I'm an AI text-based model and I don't have the ability to generate diagrams, but I can write out the steps on how you may be able to create the sequence diagram for the given User Story in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Waiter" as W
participant "Menu System" as M
participant "Inventory System" as I

activate W
W -> M: Selects item to order
activate M
M -> I: Send query for item availability
activate I
I --> M: Response about item availability
deactivate I
M --> W: Display item availability
deactivate M
@enduml
```

In this scenario:

- The "Waiter" (W) communicates with the "Menu System (M) to request the availability of the order items.
- The "Menu System" (M) then communicates with the "Inventory System" (I) which checks the availability of the order items and sends back a response.
- The "Menu System" displays this response (i.e., the item availability) to the "Waiter".

This is a simplistic diagram and real-life scenarios could involve more complex interactions.

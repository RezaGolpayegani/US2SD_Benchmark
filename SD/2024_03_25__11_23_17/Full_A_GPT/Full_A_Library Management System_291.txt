To generate a detailed sequence diagram for this user story, we would first outline the interaction steps among objects (actors) then represent them in a Plant UML format.

Below are the steps:
1. Member logs into the system
2. System authenticates the Member
3. Member requests to see comments
4. System fetches subscribed comments from other Members
5. System displays fetched comments

Now we will represent this in Plant UML Format:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Member
participant System

Member --> System: Logs into System
activate System
System --> Member: Authenticates Member
activate Member
Member --> System: Requests to see comments
activate System
System --> System: Fetches comments from Database
System --> Member: Display comments

@enduml
```

This UML Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format illustrates the sequence of interactions occurring when a member wants to see other members' comments for book suggestions. The sequence starts with the member logging in, the system authenticating the member, the member requesting to see comments, the system fetching the comments, and finally, the system displaying the comments to the member. The communication direction is expressed with arrows and the actor (Member) who initiates the sequence starts on the left.

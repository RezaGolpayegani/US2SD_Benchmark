As an AI model, I'm unable to draw diagrams, but I can provide you with a textual Plant UML sequence diagram based on your project description.

```
@startuml
title Supervisor and Researcher Activity Review Sequence

actor Supervisor
entity "Researcher Activity System" as System
database "Researcher Activity Database" as DB

Supervisor -> System: Request to view researcher activity
activate System

System -> DB: Retrieve activity data
activate DB

DB --> System: Return activity data
deactivate DB

System --> Supervisor: Display activity data
deactivate System

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the supervisor making a request to the System to view researcher activity data. The System then requests this data from the Researcher Activity Database (DB). The DB returns the requested data to the System, which then displays the activity data to the supervisor.
Please note you may need to adjust this base on your project specifics, as the interaction could be more complex including authentication, validation, and so on.

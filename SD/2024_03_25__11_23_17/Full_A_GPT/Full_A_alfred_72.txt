As the AI model cannot generate visual Sequence Diagrams, it can only provide a narrative to describe how the Sequence Diagram may look like in Plant UML format:

1. Participant "OlderPerson" start the sequence by sending a message "ActivateALFRED" to "ALFRED"
2. "ALFRED" responds to this by activating and sends back "ALFREDActivated" message to "OlderPerson"
3. "OlderPerson" sends "SearchArtExpositionOrMuseum" message to "ALFRED"
4. "ALFRED" collects data via "InternetService" by sending "FetchArtExpositionOrMuseumData" 
5. "InternetService" replies with "ArtExpositionOrMuseumData" message to "ALFRED"
6. "ALFRED" processes the data and sends back "DisplayArtExpositionOrMuseumInformation" message to "OlderPerson" 

The corresponding Plant UML code will look like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant ALFRED
participant InternetService
  
OlderPerson -> ALFRED: ActivateALFRED  
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: ALFREDActivated
OlderPerson -> ALFRED: SearchArtExpositionOrMuseum 
ALFRED -> InternetService: FetchArtExpositionOrMuseumData
InternetService --> ALFRED: ArtExpositionOrMuseumData
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: DisplayArtExpositionOrMuseumInformation

This sequence diagram visualizes how an older person might use the ALFRED system to learn about art expositions or a museum. Please note that I have kept the operation names generic, they should be renamed according to your actual operations' specifications and protocols.

As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can generate guidance but I cannot draw diagrams or generate code directly. Here's an outline on how you can create a sequence diagram based on your user story using PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Customer Sees Menu Sequence Diagram

actor Customer
participant System

Customer -> System: Initiate App
activate System 

System -> Menu: Get Menu
activate Menu 

Menu -->> System: Return Menu Details 

System -->> Customer: Display Menu
deactivate System 
@enduml
```

In the sequence above,

- The Customer initiates the application.
- The System then requests the Menu for details.
- After getting the Menu details, the System then displays the Menu to the Customer.

You may need to adapt the script to your exact environment and situation.

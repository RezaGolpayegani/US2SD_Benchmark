It seems there's a bit of confusion here, as it's impossible to create a UML sequence diagram through text only. To help visualize, here's a very simple text description of how the UML sequence diagram might look in this scenario:
```
User->Dataset: Select Dataset
Dataset->User: Provide Dataset Types
User->Dataset: Select Dataset Type
Dataset->Schema Tool: Request Schema
Schema Tool->Dataset: Provide Schema Template
User-> Schema Tool: Specify Schema Details
Schema Tool-> Dataset: Save Schema
Dataset->User: Confirm Schema
```
This is how you would denote it in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant Dataset
participant "Schema Tool" as ST

User -> Dataset: Select Dataset
Dataset --> User: Provide Dataset Types
User -> Dataset: Select Dataset Type
Dataset -> ST: Request Schema
ST --> Dataset: Provide Schema Template
User -> ST: Specify Schema details
ST -> Dataset: Save Schema
Dataset --> User: Confirm Schema 
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram assumes that there is a tool or service (labelled as "Schema Tool") that the dataset calls to provide the schema template. Do remember this is a simple generalization, your actual sequence might get complicated depending on your technical design and requirement. 

To actually generate a diagram, you would put this syntax into a PlantUML renderer such as the one available online on the official PlantUML website or an integrated development environment that supports PlantUML.

You could also learn PlantUML syntax on the official website, and edit this code to fit your specific needs.

Here's an initial attempt at providing a detailed sequence diagram in the textual notation accepted by Plant UML for the user story provided. You can modify this draft according to the specifics and an exact sequence of your system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Staff as S
entity "Book Reservation System" as BRS
database "Books DB" as BDB

S->BRS: Selects "Checkout Book" option
activate BRS
BRS->BDB: Sends query for available books
activate BDB
BDB-->BRS: Returns list of available books
deactivate BDB
BRS-->S: Shows list of available books
S->BRS: Selects a book and confirms checkout
BRS->BDB: Sends query to update book status to "Checked Out"
activate BDB
BDB-->BRS: Confirms status update
deactivate BDB
BRS-->S: Confirmation of book checkout
deactivate BRS
@enduml
```
In this sequence diagram, the actor `Staff` interacts with `Book Reservation System`, which in turn communicates with `Books DB` to obtain information about available books, and to update the status of the books.
This diagram can be copy-pasted in the PlantUML online editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

Please understand that the actual implementation can be much more detailed, might have some additional actors/steps, or be different depending on the specifics of your system, authentication procedures, etc.

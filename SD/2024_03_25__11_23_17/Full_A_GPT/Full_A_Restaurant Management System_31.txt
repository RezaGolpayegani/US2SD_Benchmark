Creating a sequence diagram involves a lot of complexities that are tough to explain just with text. But I'll outline the steps and elements you would need to construct a sequence diagram for this user story in PlantUML format. You can adjust it as per your specific needs.

To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the given user story, we'd need to first identify the system components which might include: `Chef`, `Inventory`, `Kitchen`, and `Order management system`.

Here's a sample diagram assuming what could happen when the chef updates the status of an ordered item to "served":

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
title Updating status of ordered items to served
actor Chef
participant "Order management system" as System
participant Kitchen
participant Inventory

Chef -> System: Request to update status (orderId, status:served)
  activate System
System -> Kitchen: Informs kitchen to prepare food (orderId)
  activate Kitchen
Kitchen -> Inventory: Checks for necessary ingredients
  activate Inventory
Inventory --> Kitchen: Confirm availability of ingredients
  deactivate Inventory
Kitchen --> System: Confirms food preparation
  deactivate Kitchen
System --> Chef: Updates status of order to 'served'
  deactivate System
@enduml
```

This diagram has the following sequences:

1. The `Chef` sends a request to the `Order management system` to update the order's status.
2. `Order management system` informs the `Kitchen` to prepare the proposed order.
3. `Kitchen` checks the `Inventory` for required ingredients.
4. If the ingredients are available, `Inventory` sends the confirmation back to `Kitchen`.
5. Once the food is ready, `Kitchen` notifies the `Order management System`.
6. Finally, `Order management System` informs the `Chef` that the status of the order has been updated to 'served'.

Please adjust the components, interactions, and actions as per your specific system design and requirements.

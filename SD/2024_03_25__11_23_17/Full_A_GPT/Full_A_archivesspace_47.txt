Due to the limitations in text-based interfaces, creating a sequence diagram can be challenging. However, it should not be impossible. Here is a Plant UML syntax that describes the sequence of interactions for your user story:

@startuml
'autogenerated with Plantuml

actor "Repository Manager" as user

participant "System UI" as system

database "Repository" as repo

== Create a Record ==

user -> system : Request to open repository
activate system
system -> repo : Open repository
activate repo
repo --> system : Repository opened

system --> user : Present repository interface
user -> system : Input new data and submit
system -> repo : Create new record with data
activate repo
repo --> system : Record created successfully
system --> user : Confirm record creation

== Update a Record ==

user -> system : Request to Open Repository
system -> repo : Open Repository
repo --> system : Repository Opened
system --> user : Present Repository Interface
user -> system : Identify Record to be Updated and Input New Data, then Submit
system -> repo : Update Existing Record with New Data
repo --> system : Updated Successfully
system --> user : Confirm Record Update

== Delete a Record ==

user -> system : Request to Open Repository
system -> repo : Open Repository
repo --> system : Repository Opened
system --> user : Present Repository Interface
user -> system : Identify Record to be Deleted and Confirm
system -> repo : Delete Record
repo --> system : Deleted Successfully
system --> user : Confirm Record Deletion

Please note that this sequence diagram assumes a simple system, where the Repository Manager only interacts with a system interface and a repository. Your actual system may have more components and more complex interactions, which should be represented in the sequence diagram.

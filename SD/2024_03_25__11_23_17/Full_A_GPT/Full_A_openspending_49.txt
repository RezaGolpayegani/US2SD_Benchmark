In the above sequence diagram:

1. A Data Consuming User enters the dataset title or metadata information in the search bar on the Front-end User Interface.
2. This User Interface then sends this search query to the Back-end Server.
3. The Back-end Server sends a request to the Database, asking it to return all dataset objects matching the User input.
4. The Database then returns the matching datasets to the Back-end Server.
5. The Back-end Server then sends back these results to the Front-end User Interface.
6. Finally, the Front-end User Interface displays these datasets to the Data Consuming User.

This diagram gives a high-level overview of the steps involved in the searching process by a data consumer using their title and metadata.

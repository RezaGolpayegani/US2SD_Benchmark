As an AI model, I am unable to draw diagrams. However, I can provide you the appropriate code for creating a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML. Here is the PlantUML code for the user story:

```
@startuml
title Extract Metadata from DMP and Import into Data Catalogue
actor DataLibrarian
participant DMP_System as DMP
participant OtherSystem as OS
participant DataCatalogue as DC

DataLibrarian -> DMP : getRequest(DMP_MetadataPointers)
activate DMP
DMP --> DataLibrarian : return(MetadataPointers)
deactivate DMP

DataLibrarian -> OS : getRequest(Metadata, MetadataPointers)
activate OS
OS --> DataLibrarian : return(Resources)
deactivate OS

DataLibrarian -> DC : putRequest(Resources)
activate DC
DC --> DataLibrarian : return(ImportStatus)
deactivate DC
@enduml
```

This diagram works as follows:

1. The data librarian sends a request to the DMP system to get the metadata pointers.
2. The DMP system returns the metadata pointers.
3. The data librarian then sends a request to the other system using the metadata pointers, asking for the related resources.
4. The other system returns the resources.
5. The data librarian sends a put request to the data catalog, indicating that it wants to insert these resources.
6. The data catalog returns the status of the import operation. This status tells the data librarian whether the operation was successful.

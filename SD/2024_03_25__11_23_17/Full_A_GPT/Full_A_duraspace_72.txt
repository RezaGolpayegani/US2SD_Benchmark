It's difficult to share sequence diagrams here because this platform doesn't support PlantUML syntax or other graphics. However, I can describe how to create the sequence diagram based on your User Story.

Below is a textual representation of a sequence diagram for the scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "System Interface" as SI
participant "Database/Server" as DB

RM -> SI : Access System
SI -->RM: Load Interface
RM -> SI : Select collection/object
SI --> DB : Retrieve collection/object data
DB --> SI : Send collection/object data
SI --> RM : Display object/collection details
RM -> SI : Input name role 
SI --> DB : Update object/collection details
DB --> SI : Confirm data update
SI --> RM : Display update confirmation
@enduml
```

Explained sequence:

1. `Repository Manager` accesses the system.
2. `System Interface` returns and loads the interface.
3. `Repository Manager` selects the collection or object to which they want to assign the role.
4. `System Interface` retrieves the object or collection data from the `Database/Server`.
5. `Database/Server` sends back the data.
6. `System Interface` displays the object or collection details to the `Repository Manager`.
7. `Repository Manager` inputs the role (such as illustrator, photographer, etc.) for the selected name.
8. `System Interface` updates the details in the `Database/Server`.
9. `Database/Server` confirms data update.
10. `System Interface` displays a success message to `Repository Manager`.

You can generate the sequence diagram by putting the given script into an online Plant UML editor.

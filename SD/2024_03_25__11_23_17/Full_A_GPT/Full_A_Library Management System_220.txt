As an AI, I can't create visual diagrams. However, I can describe how you can write a sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story.

A sequence diagram details interactions between objects in a sequential order i.e: time-based manner. 

This is a basic example for your specific case:

```
@startuml
title Manager Views Missing Book Numbers

actor Manager as M
participant "Management System" as MS
participant "Inventory System" as IS

M -> MS: RequestMissingBookNumbers()
activate MS
MS -> IS: FetchMissingBookNumbers()
activate IS
IS -->> MS: ReturnMissingBookNumbers()
deactivate IS
MS -->> M: DisplayMissingBookNumbers()
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. The `Manager` actor sends a `RequestMissingBookNumbers()` message to the `Management System`.
2. Then, the `Management System` interacts with the `Inventory System` to fetch the missing book numbers.
3. The `Inventory System` then returns these numbers to the `Management System`.
4. Finally, the `Management System` displays the missing book numbers to the `Manager`.

Note: In PlantUML syntax, `-->` represents synchronous calls, `->` for asynchronous, `-->>` for a return, and `activate` and `deactivate` to denote the period an object is active.

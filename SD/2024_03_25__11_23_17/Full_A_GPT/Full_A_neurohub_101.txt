To generate a detailed sequence diagram for the user story in Plant UML format, let's break down the activities:

1. Researcher logs into the repository system.
2. Researcher creates a new group-level repository.
3. Researcher shares papers to the repository.
4. Researcher writes or shares reviews in the repository.
5. Researcher adds comments in the repository.
6. Other researchers viewing/interacting with the repository and its contents.

The Plant UML sequence diagram would be written in this format:

```puml
@startuml
participant "Researcher" as R
participant "Repository System" as S
participant "Other Researchers" as O

R -> S: Authenticate
S --> R: Success Authentication
R -> S: Create Repository
S --> R: Success Repository Creation
R -> S: Share Papers
S --> R: Success papers sharing
R -> S: Add Reviews
S --> R: Success Reviews Addition
R -> S: Add Comments
S --> R: Success Comments Addition
activate O
O -> S: View Papers/Reviews/Comments
S --> O: Show Repository Contents
deactivate O
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram visualizes the researcher's interactions with the repository system and how other researchers access the shared information.

Please note, the diagram assumes that the system responds with a success message after each action from the researcher. The diagram may look different if there are more complex scenarios involved, for instance, error handling. To make the visualization of this PlantUML code, you may use any PlantUML live editor available online.

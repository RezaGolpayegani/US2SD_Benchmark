This is a brief overview of a sequence diagram for the required user story. Due to the incapability of text-based interfaces to accurately draw diagrams, I'll be providing unicode-based commands that can be used on PlantUML tools to generate the sequence diagram. 

```
@startuml
participant Repository_Manager as RM
participant System as S
participant Database as DB

RM -> S : Monitor language changes
activate S

S -> DB: Retrieve data
activate DB

DB -->> S : Return data
deactivate DB

S -> S : Identify language changes

alt no changes
    S -->> RM : No changes
else changes
    S -->> RM : Report language changes
end 

deactivate S

@enduml
```
Interactivity breakdown:

1. The Repository Manager (RM) requires the System (S) to monitor any changes in language identified for a collection, object, or object component.
2. The system then retrieves necessary data from the Database (DB).
3. The database in response returns the necessary data back to the System.
4. System analyzes this data and identifies if any changes are made to the languages.
5. Depending upon whether any changes have been identified or not, System responds back to Repository Manager with the appropriate message (either reporting no changes or reporting what changes have been identified).

Please ensure to adapt this script with actual component/system names and data specifics to get the detailed sequence diagram.

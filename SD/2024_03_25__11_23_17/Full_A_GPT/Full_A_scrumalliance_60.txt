I'm an AI and unable to draw directly, but I can provide a text representation of a sequence diagram for your User Story using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml

participant "Site Visitor" as A
participant "Website" as B
participant "Database" as C

A -> B: Browse Website
activate B
B -> C: Request articles
activate C
C --> B: Return articles
deactivate C
B --> A: Display articles
deactivate B
```

This sequence diagram represents the following series of events:

1. The Site Visitor (A) opens/browses the Website (B).
2. The Website requests the articles from the Database (C).
3. The Database returns the articles to the Website.
4. The Website displays these articles to the Site Visitor. 

You need to copy the above PlantUML syntax and paste it into a PlantUML editor to visualize the diagram. There are online editors available such as http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml that will render text input into a visual UML diagram.

As an AI model, I can't draw diagrams. However, I can certainly explain the sequence of actions what it should look like in a sequence diagram.

1. User chooses to import a Google Spreadsheet.
   - Never interacted with Google before: User redirected to Google Login Screen. User logs in and gives permissions. Redirected back to data packager with access token.
   - Interacted with Google before: System uses stored access token.
   
2. If the login is successful, the system uses access token to call Google API for spreadsheet data. The system requests the data for a specific spreadsheet based on user input (spreadsheet ID or URL).

3. Google API sends back spreadsheet data in CSV or JSON format.

4. The system processes the data and transforms it into a format that can be used within the data packager. This might involve converting columns to specific data types, addressing null values, or other transformations.

5. After data is properly formatted, it is loaded into the data packager.

6. The system then allows the user to perform further actions on the data within the data packager, such as data analysis or visualization.

Here is a simple textual representation of the sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
actor User
participant "Data Packager" as DP
participant "Google API" as GA

User -> DP : Choose to import Google Spreadsheet
alt Never interacted with Google before
 User -> DP : Login and gives permissions
 DP -> GA : Access Token
else Interacted with Google before
 DP -> GA:  Access Token
end
DP -> GA : Request data
GA -> DP : Send back data
DP -> DP : Process and transform data
DP -> User: Load data into data packager
```

This sequence flow ensures that the user story, which involves importing and using data from a Google Spreadsheet without needing to deal with data format conversions manually, is fulfilled by the system.

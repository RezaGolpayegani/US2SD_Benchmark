Sure, here's a plain text representation of your UML sequence diagram. Unfortunately, this platform doesn't support UML graphics, but you can simply copy it into your preferred UML sequence diagram tool like PlantUML to visualize it:

```plantuml
title Manager evaluates waiter performance

participant Manager as M
participant System as S
participant Database as DB

M->S: Request for waiter order summaries
activate S

S->DB: Retrieve order data
activate DB

DB-->S: Order data response
deactivate DB

S->DB: Retrieve waiter data
activate DB

DB-->S: Waiter data response
deactivate DB

S-->M: Waiter order summaries
deactivate S
```

To break it down step by step:

1. The Manager makes a request to the System to get the order summaries of each waiter.
2. The System then makes a request to the Database to retrieve the data for all orders.
3. The Database responds with the Order data.
4. The System again makes a request to the Database, now to retrieve the waiters' data.
5. The Database responds with the Waiter data.
6. The System then combines these two pieces of information to generate a summary of orders taken by each waiter, and sends this summary to the Manager.

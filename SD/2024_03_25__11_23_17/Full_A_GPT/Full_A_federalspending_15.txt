Creating a sequence diagram for the User Story requires knowledge over the specific details of the system. However, I can provide you an example of how that sequence diagram might look like using PlantUML. 

1. In order to verify that USAspending only sends grant records, it would likely involve several participants including the Owner, the USAspending System, possibly a Grant Record Verification System, and the Owner's System.

2. The process might involve the Owner sending a request to the USAspending System to send grant records. The system then retrieves these records and sends them to the Verification System which confirms they are indeed grant records.

3. The Verification System then sends them to the Owner's system.

4. Once the record is received, the owner's system sends a confirmation back to the owner.

Here is a PlantUML script of that interaction

```plantuml
@startuml
    actor Owner
    participant "USASpending System" as USA
    participant "Administrator's System" as ADM
    database "Verification System" as VS

    Owner -> ADM : Request Grant Record
    activate ADM
    ADM -> USA : Send Grant Records
    activate USA
    USA -> VS : Verify Records
    activate VS
    VS --> USA : Verified Grant Records
    deactivate VS
    USA --> ADM : Send Verified Grant Records
    deactivate USA
    ADM --> Owner : Confirmation of Receipt
    deactivate ADM

```

Please, remember to replace the strings in the double-quotes with the actual names of the systems that interact in this specific scenario.

This code can be inputted into a PlantUML tool to get a visual sequence diagram. Make sure to note that this diagram can change in considerable amount, upon knowing the details of the system. You might want to adjust the sequence diagram based on the actual behavior of the system.

For a plain text response, it's impossible to create a sequence diagram as Plant UML format visuals can't be represented. However, I can show you an example of how the Plant UML code might look like, for the given user's story.

Let's assume that we have three systems participating in this interaction: UserInterface, ResearcherSystem, and CollectionSystem. Here's how this might translate into Plant UML:

```PlantUML
@startuml

actor Researcher

Researcher -> UserInterface: Request citation information
activate UserInterface

UserInterface -> ResearcherSystem: Forward citation info request
activate ResearcherSystem

ResearcherSystem -> CollectionSystem: Request citation info
activate CollectionSystem

CollectionSystem --> ResearcherSystem: Return citation info
deactivate CollectionSystem

ResearcherSystem --> UserInterface: Return citation info
deactivate ResearcherSystem

UserInterface --> Researcher: Provide citation info
deactivate UserInterface

@enduml
```

This diagram, when rendered, will show the researcher interacting with a user interface to request citation info. The request passes through a hypothetical ResearcherSystem which interacts with the CollectionSystem to gather the citation information, then returns back through the same path to the researcher. The `activate` and `deactivate` notes show when each participant is active (e.g., executing or waiting for a response).

You may adapt this example to more precisely fit your system structure and the interaction details for your specific use case.

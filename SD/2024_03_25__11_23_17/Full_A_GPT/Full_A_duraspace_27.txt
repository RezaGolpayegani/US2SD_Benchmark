Unfortunately, as a text-based model, I'm not able to create diagrams or images. However, I can tell you the steps to create a sequence diagram for your user story in Plant UML format.

Generally for your user story, the sequence could be:

- Repository manager requests object life cycle events from the system.
- The system locates the requested object in the database.
- System retrieves the object's life cycle events.
- System sends back the information to the Repository manager.

Here is how you'd go about it in Plant UML:
```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

RM -> S : Requests Object Lifecycle
activate S
S -> D : Get Object Lifecycle
activate D
D --> S : Return Object Lifecycle
deactivate D
S --> RM : Show Object Lifecycle
deactivate S
@enduml
```
Please make sure to use a Plant UML editor to visualize this UML. 

This is a simplified version and would need to be updated according to the specific actions available in the system and the data storage specifics etc.

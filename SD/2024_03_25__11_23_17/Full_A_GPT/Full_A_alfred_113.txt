Firstly, let's describe the sequence of interactions in plain text then generate PlantUML code. 

1. User Story: An elderly person wants to play a game that significantly requires both mental and physical exercise, such as opposing motion exercises of arms and legs.
2. Sequence:
   i. The "ElderlyPerson" actor initiates the system
   ii. The system presents a list of available games
   iii. The "ElderlyPerson" selects a game for Mental and Physical exercise
   iv. The system launches the game and provides instructions
   v. The "ElderlyPerson" understands the instructions and starts playing the game
   vi. The system monitors and records the performance

Here is a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML format that reflects the above sequence.

```puml
@startuml
actor ElderlyPerson
participant "System"

ElderlyPerson -> System : Initiate
System --> ElderlyPerson : Show available games
ElderlyPerson -> System : Select Mental and Physical Exercise Game
System --> ElderlyPerson : Launch Game and provide instructions
ElderlyPerson -> System : Start Playing
System --> System : Monitor and Record Performance
@enduml
```

The above PlantUML code represents a sequence diagram for the given user story. It includes interactions between the "ElderlyPerson" (actor) and the "System" (participant), which are marked with arrows denoting the direction of interaction.

Please note that, the actual code and interactions can depend a lot on the system's architecture and the specifics of the games.

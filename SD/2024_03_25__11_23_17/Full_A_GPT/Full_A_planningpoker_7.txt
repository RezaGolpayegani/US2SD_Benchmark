Here's a basic sequence diagram for the above user story:

```
@startuml
actor Moderator

box "Moderator System"
  entity "Moderator Dashboard" as dashboard
  entity "List of Items" as list
  entity "Edit Item Screen" as edit
  entity "Save Changes" as save
end box

Moderator->dashboard: Access dashboard
dashboard->list: Display list of all items
Moderator->list: Choose an item to edit
list->edit: Open item in 'Edit Item' mode
Moderator->edit: Makes changes to the item
edit->save: Save the changes
save-->dashboard: Updates the item in the list
@enduml
```
This simple sequence diagram presents the basic interaction that a moderator would have with the system when they want to edit an item. Notice that it details each step of the process. Of course, depending on the complexity of the system, there could be more intermediate steps that could be included in the diagram. However, based on the given user story, these are the primary interactions that would need to occur, according to the process described.

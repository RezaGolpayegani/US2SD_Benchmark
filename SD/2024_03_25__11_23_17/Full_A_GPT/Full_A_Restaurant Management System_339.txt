As an AI, I'm unable to directly create diagrams. However, I can provide you with the PlantUML code which you can run on any PlantUML editor to generate the Sequence Diagram. Note that you might need to adapt it to fit your exact needs.

```PlantUML
@startuml

actor Employee
entity "Customer Review System" as System
database "Customer Database" as Database
actor Customer

Employee -> System: Login to System
alt successful login
    System -> Employee: Access to Review Module
    alt select Review Module
        Employee -> System: Select 'Enter Review' Option
        System -> Employee: Show 'Enter Review' Form
        Employee -> System: Fill the form and Submit
        System -> System: Validate the review details
        alt review is valid
            System -> Database: Save review in database
            Database --> System: Acknowledge save
            System -> Employee: Confirm successful submission
            Employee -> System: Request customer consent
            System -> Customer: Request consent for review
            alt consent given
                Customer -> System: Give Consent for Review
                System -> Database: Update consent in database
                Database --> System: Acknowledge update
                System -> Employee : Confirm consent received
            else consent denied
                Customer -> System: Deny Consent for Review
                System -> Employee: Notify consent denial
            end
        else review is invalid
            System -> Employee: Show Error
        end
    else not able to select Review Module
        System -> Employee: Show Error
    end
else unsuccessful login
    System -> Employee: Show Error
end

This sequence diagram follows the general process:

1. The employee logs in to the system and accesses the review module.
2. The employee chooses to enter a review and fills in the corresponding form with the input data.
3. The system validates the review.
4. If the review is valid, it's saved into the database.
5. The system then asks for customer consent.
6. If the customer consents, the review is approved and stored in the system.
7. If the customer does not consent, the employee is notified.

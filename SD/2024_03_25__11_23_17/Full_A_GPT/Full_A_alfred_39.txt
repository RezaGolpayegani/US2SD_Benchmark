Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model, I'm unable to create detailed visual diagrams directly. However, I can describe how the sequence diagram might be created using PlantUML syntax. 

**Preconditions:** 
The OlderPerson is on the main screen of the ALFRED application. ALFRED is turned on and ready for the navigation task. 

**Sequence Diagram:**

This is an approximate sequence of events rendered as PlantUML code.

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor OlderPerson
boundary "ALFRED App" as A
control "ALFRED Navigation System" as AN

OlderPerson -> A: Opens navigation menu
A -> AN: InitiateNavigation()
AN -> AN: CalculateCurrentLocation()
AN <-- A: Returns current location  
A <-- OlderPerson: Sets desired destination  
A -> AN: SetDestination(desired location)
AN -> AN: CalculateRoute()
A <-- AN: Returns optimal route

OlderPerson <- A: Shows optimal navigation route

@enduml
```

**Postconditions:**
The OlderPerson gets the optimal route for the desired destination from their current location. They can now use ALFRED for navigation.

Please note:
In this kind of PlantUML sequence diagram, arrows (`->`) represent actions or signals flowing from a participant to another. A colon (`:`) is used to elaborate what action is happening.
This syntax is meant to be placed into a PlantUML tool or processor to create an actual diagram.

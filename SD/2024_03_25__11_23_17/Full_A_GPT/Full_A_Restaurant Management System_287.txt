This diagram is defined using the PlantUML language. Please note when those lines of codes are rendered using a PlantUML environment, they will produce a graphical sequence diagram. Here it is:

```
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant Menu

Waiter -> Menu: requestMenuItems()
activate Menu
Menu --> Waiter: returnMenuItems()
deactivate Menu
Waiter -> Waiter: displayMenuItems()
@enduml
```

In this sequence:

- The `Waiter` (as a system user) interacts with the `Menu` (as a system).
- A `requestMenuItems()` is sent from the `Waiter` to the `Menu`.
- The `Menu` responds with a `returnMenuItems()`.
- Finally, the `Waiter` executes `displayMenuItems()` to show the menu to the customers.

Please make sure to use a PlantUML compiler to visualize this diagram.

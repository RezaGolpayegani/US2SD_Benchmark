Here's a sequence diagram in Plant UML format representing the user story.
Please note that the actual sequence might differ according to the real application flow. I've just made assumptions for demonstration purposes.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Repository Manager" as manager 

participant "Data Server" as server

participant "Database" as db

manager -> server: RequestDataDetails()
activate server

server -> db: FetchDataDetails()
activate db

db --> server: ReturnDataDetails()
deactivate db

server --> manager: ProvideDataDetails()
deactivate server

@enduml
```

Flow:

1. The Repository Manager requests the data details from the Data Server.
2. The Data Server processes this request and fetches the details from the Database.
3. The Database returns these details to the Data Server.
4. Finally, the Data Server provides these details to the Repository Manager.

Note: 

This is a very simplified version, actual system may involve additional steps like authorization, exception handling etc. 

Quick Legend:

- The "->" arrow represents the direction of the request.
- The "-->" arrow shows the response direction. 
- The "activate" keyword is used to start a process, and the "deactivate" keyword is used to end it.
  
Also, please ensure that you have the needed tools and libraries to convert this code into a sequence diagram.

I believe there has been some misunderstanding here. Sequence diagrams are usually created to depict interactions between different system components or between a user and a system in specific scenarios, for instance, making a payment, scheduling an appointment, etc. Your provided user story, while it addresses an important requirement (non-stigmatizing ALFRED shirt for an older person), doesn't exactly provide a system interaction or process that could be mapped into a sequence diagram.

If you mean that the OlderPerson wants to order a non-stigmatizing ALFRED shirt, the following PlantUML could be a starting point. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson 
participant "Online Store" as A
participant "Inventory System" as B
participant "Order Processing" as C

OlderPerson -> A: Browse shirts
A --> OlderPerson: Provide shirt options
OlderPerson -> A: Select ALFRED shirt
A --> B: Check availability of ALFRED shirt
B --> A: Confirm availability 
A --> OlderPerson: Confirm availability and ask for payment
OlderPerson -> A: Complete payment
A --> C: Process order
C --> A: Confirm order
A --> OlderPerson: Provide order confirmation

```

Replace OlderPerson, Online Store, Inventory System, and Order Processing with relevant actor and system components in your context.

Please provide a more specific interaction scenario if this is not what you are looking for.

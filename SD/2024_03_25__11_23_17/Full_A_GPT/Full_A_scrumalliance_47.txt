Here is a Plant UML sequence diagram code that describes the User Story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteAdmin
entity "Help Wanted Page" as HelpPage
database "Website Database" as Db

SiteAdmin -> HelpPage: Request Help Ad Listing
activate HelpPage

HelpPage -> Db: Fetch Help Ad
activate Db

Db --> HelpPage: Help Ad Data
deactivate Db

HelpPage --> SiteAdmin: Display Help Ad List
deactivate HelpPage

SiteAdmin -> HelpPage: Edit/Delete Ad Request
activate HelpPage

HelpPage -> Db: Edit/Delete Ad in Database
activate Db

Db --> HelpPage: Confirm Edit/Delete
deactivate Db

HelpPage --> SiteAdmin: Confirm Edit/Delete
deactivate HelpPage
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the following actions occur:

1. The `SiteAdmin` requests to view the list of help wanted ads from the `Help Wanted Page`.
2. The `Help Wanted Page` fetches the ads from the `Website Database`.
3. The `Website Database` returns the help ad data to the `Help Wanted Page`.
4. The `Help Wanted Page` displays the list of ads to the `SiteAdmin`.
5. The `SiteAdmin` then either chooses to edit or delete an ad, sending a request to the `Help Wanted Page`.
6. The `Help Wanted Page` then processes the request by either editing or deleting the ad in the `Website Database`.
7. The `Website Database` then confirms the action and returns the confirmation to `Help Wanted Page`.
8. Finally, `Help Wanted Page` signals a confirmation of the action to the `SiteAdmin`.

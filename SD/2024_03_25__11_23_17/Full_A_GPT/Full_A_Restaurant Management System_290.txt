Sequence diagrams show the way processes operate with each other and in what order. The User Story will be translated into a Sequence Diagram using Plant UML format, as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Sequence Diagram - Entering Order Details by Waiter
actor Waiter
participant OrderingSystem

Waiter -> OrderingSystem : Input Order Details
activate OrderingSystem
OrderingSystem --> Waiter : Show Order Confirmation
deactivate OrderingSystem
Waiter -> OrderingSystem : Confirm Order
activate OrderingSystem
OrderingSystem --> Waiter : Update Order Status
deactivate OrderingSystem
@enduml
```
In the above Plant UML Sequence Diagram:

1. The Actor in this case is the Waiter who will interact with the Ordering System in order to enter the details of food order received from the customers.

2. The process starts when the waiter inputs the order details into the online ordering system.

3. The Ordering System receives the order details and shows an acknowledgment to the Waiter in form of Order Confirmation.

4. The Waiter cross-checks the ordered details and gives a confirmation on the order.

5. Finally, the Ordering System updates and maintains the status of the current order and shows feedback to the Waiter. 

Please ensure that you have the right tools necessary to visualize this Plant UML sequence diagram.

To create a sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to take suggestions" you need to determine and state clearly the actors, the system and the actions that are being carried out. Here is how such a diagram could look like in PlantUML:

```
@startuml
autonumber

participant "Member" as A
participant "System" as B

A -> B: Login()
activate B
B --> A: Successful Login
deactivate B
activate A

A -> B: Request Suggestions()
activate B
B --> A: Load Suggestions
deactivate B
activate A

A -> B: ReceiveSuggestions(suggestions)
activate B
B --> A: Display Suggestions (suggestions)
deactivate B
activate A

deactivate A
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
1. The member logs into the system. 
2. The system acknowledges the successful login. 
3. The member then requests for suggestions.
4. The system loads the suggestions.
5. The member receives the suggestions from the system.
6. The system displays the suggestions to the member. 

Of course, the details of the interaction might vary considerably depending on the specifics of your system. For instance, there may be input validation steps, error handling steps, or other intermediate steps that have not been included in this basic sequence diagram. Please modify according to your specific system needs.

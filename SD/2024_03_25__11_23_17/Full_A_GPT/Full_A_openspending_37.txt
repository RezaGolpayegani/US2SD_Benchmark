As an AI developed by OpenAI, I currently do not have the capability to create diagrams including the UML sequence diagrams. However, I can help you describe what that sequence diagram for the given user story could contain.  

1. The API user sends a `request for data normalization` with specific identification for the GINI and related socioeconomic indexes to the API server.
2. The API Server validates the `request`.
3.a. If the `request is valid`, it sends a `query` to the Data Server to fetch the required data.
3.b. If the `request is invalid`, it sends an `error message` back to the API user.
4. The Data Server validates the `query`.
5.a. If the `query is valid`, it `fetches` the required data and sends it back to the API Server.
5.b. If the `query is invalid`, it sends an `error message` back to the API Server.
6. The API Server receives the data from the Data Server. It then `normalizes` the data using GINI and other socioeconomic indexes.
7. The normalized data is sent as a `response` back to the API user.
   
Each of the above points represents a transition (represented by an arrow) in the sequence diagram. Due to the nature of the sequence diagram, these points need not be explicitly written in the diagram but rather graphically represented.

As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am not capable of drawing diagrams, but I can help you to describe how you can create one using Plant UML syntax. 

Firstly, one must understand what a sequence diagram is. A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in a time sequence, depicting the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between these objects.

Here is an example of sequence diagram for waiter viewing menu in Plant UML syntax:
```plantuml
@startuml
    -> Actor: Waiter
    box "Application"
        Waiter -> "App Interface": Login
        activate "App Interface"
        "App Interface" -> Database: ValidateCredentials
        activate Database
        Database --> "App Interface": Response
        deactivate Database
        "App Interface" --> Waiter: LoginSuccess
        deactivate "App Interface"
        Waiter -> "App Interface": OpenMenu
        activate "App Interface"
        "App Interface" -> Database: FetchMenuItems
        activate Database
        Database --> "App Interface": MenuItems
        deactivate Database
        "App Interface" --> Waiter: DisplayMenu
    endbox
    -> Actor: 
@enduml
```
This script represents the following flow:

1. The waiter (actor) logs into the application.
2. The application interface interacts with the database to validate the waiter's credentials.
3. Upon successful login, the waiter requests to view the menu.
4. The application interface again interacts with the database, this time to fetch the menu items.
5. The fetched menu items are displayed to the waiter by the application interface. 

You can visualize this code on any PlantUML online editor by just copy-pasting the script above. Make sure to replace "Actor" with the specific use case name and "Waiter" can be labelled as the user taking the actions.

In this sequence diagram, the Manager interacts with the "Book Tracking System" (BTS) to request information about new books added to the current collection for the ongoing month. The BTS prompts the "Book Database" (BD) to fetch details of these new additions. The BD returns this data to the BTS, which then displays these details to the Manager.

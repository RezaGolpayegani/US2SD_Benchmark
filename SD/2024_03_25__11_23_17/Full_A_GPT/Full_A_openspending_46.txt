As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to generate diagrams directly. However, I can provide you with the textual representation that describes the sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the given user story. 

In order to add data to the datastore in bulk, the User interacts with the Python client, which in turn communicates with the datastore. Here's how you can represent this in a Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor DataPublishingUser as DUP
participant PythonClient as PC
database DataStore as DS

DUP -> PC: Execute_Bulk_Add(Ordered_Data)
activate PC
PC -> DS: Connect_to_dataStore(credentials)
activate DS
DS -->> PC: Connection_Status
deactivate DS
PC -> PC: parseData(Ordered_Data)
PC -> DS: Data_Bulk_Insert(parsed_data)
activate DS
DS -->> PC : Insert_Status
deactivate DS
PC -->> DUP : Bulk_Add_Outcome(Insert_Status)

@enduml
```

This flow begins with the user executing a bulk add command on the Python client (`Execute_Bulk_Add(Ordered_Data)`). 

The Python client then attempts to connect to the datastore (`Connect_to_dataStore(credentials)`). 

The datastore returns the connection status (`Connection_Status`). 

If the connection is successful, the Python client will parse the data (`parseData(Ordered_Data)`) and execute a bulk insert command (`Data_Bulk_Insert(parsed_data)`). 

The datastore then returns the status of the data insertion (`Insert_Status`), which the Python client relays back to the user (`Bulk_Add_Outcome(Insert_Status)`).

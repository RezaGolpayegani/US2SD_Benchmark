Sure, here's a basic Plant UML code snippet for the task of "a manager wanting to see orders". It considers the interaction between the Manager actor and Order Service.

```
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Order Service" as OS

Manager -> OS: Request to view orders
activate OS
OS --> OS: Fetch orders
OS --> Manager: Return orders
deactivate OS
@enduml
```

The above code will create a simple sequence diagram that describes the following sequence:

1. The Manager requests to view orders.
2. Order Service is activated to process this request.
3. Order Service fetches the list of all orders.
4. Order Service returns the list of all orders to the Manager.
5. The order service gets defunctionalized (deactivated) again.

Please modify this as needed according to the system's requirements and the various actions that should be represented on the diagram.

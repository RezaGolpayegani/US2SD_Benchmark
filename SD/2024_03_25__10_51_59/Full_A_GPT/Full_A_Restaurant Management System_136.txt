Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model, I am unable to directly generate detailed diagrams, which includes UML Sequence diagrams. However, I can help you write down the necessary PlantUML sequence diagram code that you can use to generate it.

```plantuml
@startuml

title Manage Employee Shifts

User -> Manager: Request shift change

Manager -> EmployeeShiftSystem: Access Employee data

EmployeeShiftSystem --> Manager: Provide Employee data

Manager -> EmployeeShiftSystem: Update shift details

EmployeeShiftSystem --> Database: Save updated shift details

Database --> EmployeeShiftSystem: Confirmation of saved changes

EmployeeShiftSystem --> Manager: Confirm successful update

Manager --> User: Inform about shift change

@enduml
```
You can use this code in a PlantUML environment to generate the sequence diagram. This sequence is made under the assumption that a user requests a shift change to a manager. The manager then accesses the employee data from the system, updates the shift details, and the system saves this information in its database. Once the changes are successfully saved, the manager is notified and, subsequently, the user informed.

Please adapt this sequence to your specific needs and context if needed.

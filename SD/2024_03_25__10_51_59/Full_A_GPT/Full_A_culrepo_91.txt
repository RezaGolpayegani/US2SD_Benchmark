Since Plant UML format can't be displayed here, I will provide the code representation in PlantUML language, you can render the visual representation using any PlantUML compiler of your choice.   

Below is the sequence diagram for the user story:  

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "DB/IR Administrator" as admin 
participant "Database" as db
participant "SystemInteractor" as si
participant "Calendar" as cal

admin -> db: Connect to repository
activate db
db-->admin : Connected
deactivate db
activate admin 

admin -> si: Check reports/datasets for future release
activate si
si -> db: Fetch upcoming reports/datasets from database
activate db
db-->si : Send future data release schedule

si-->admin : Display future reports/datasets 
deactivate si
activate admin 

admin -> cal: Add future release dates to calendar
activate cal
cal-->admin : Future release dates added successfully
deactivate admin 
@enduml
```
In this scenario, the DB/IR administrator connects to the repository (Database). They send a request to the System Interactor to check and fetch upcoming reports/datasets that have future release dates. The upcoming reports/datasets data is fetched from the database and sent back to the System Interactor which is then sent to the admin. Finally, the admin adds these future release dates to the Calendar. After completing the action, the Calendar responds with a success message.

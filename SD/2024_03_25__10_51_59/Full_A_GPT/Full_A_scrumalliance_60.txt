Based on your project description, here's a sample Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
participant "Site Visitor" as SV
participant "Web Server" as WS
participant "Web Page" as WP

SV -> WS : Request to access website
activate WS
WS --> SV : Send Web Page
deactivate WS

activate WP
SV -> WP : Choose to read article
activate WP 
WP --> SV : Display Article
deactivate WP

@enduml
```

This is a basic flow, where the Site Visitor makes a request to access the website, the Web Server sends the Web Page to the Visitor, the Visitor then chooses to read an article, and then the Web Page displays the selected article to the Site Visitor.

You can modify and elaborate this sequence diagram on your specific needs such as exact pages, details involved in opening an article, authentications, logging, etc.

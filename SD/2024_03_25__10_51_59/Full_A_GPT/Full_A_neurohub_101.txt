Due to the text-based nature of the response, we won't be able to produce a visual diagram. However, we can provide you with a PlantUML text that generates a detailed sequence diagram for your use case.

Below is a basic example, detailing the interaction between the User (Researcher), the Repository System, and the Group:

```PlantUML
@startuml

    participant "Researcher" as R
    participant "Repository System" as S
    participant "Research Group" as G

    R -> S : Request Group-level Repository
    activate S
    S --> S : Check if Repository Exists
    S -> G : Create/Get Repository
    activate G
    G --> S : Return Repository Info
    deactivate G
    S --> S : Process Repository Info
    S -> R : Send Repository Info
    deactivate S

@enduml
```

In the above given PlantUML code, following sequence of actions happen:

1. Researcher requests a group-level repository from the Repository System.
2. The Repository System checks if such a repository already exists.
3. If it doesn't exist, the Repository System asks the Research Group to create one, or otherwise get the existing one.
4. The Research Group returns the information about the repository to the Repository System.
5. The Repository System then processes this information and sends it back to the Researcher. 

Please note that you may need to adjust this diagram depending on the additional details of your specific case, as this is a very simplified version of the process. For instance, handling errors and responses for different scenarios might require you to make changes to the given example.

Here is the detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on the project description.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Moderator" as mod
participant "System"

mod -> System : Login
Activate System
System -> mod : Authenticated

mod -> System : Open game
Activate System
System -> mod : Show game details

mod -> System : Request URL for game
Activate System
System -> System : Generate URL
System -> mod : Provide URL

mod -> System : Send URL to estimator(s)
Activate System
System -> System : Notify estimator(s) by email
System -> mod : Confirmation

@enduml
```

According to this sequence diagram:
- The Moderator logs into the system.
- The system authenticates the Moderator.
- After being authenticated, the Moderator opens the game.
- The system shows the detail of the game.
- The Moderator requests a URL for the same game from the system.
- The system generates the URL and provides it to the Moderator.
- The Moderator sends the URL to the Estimators.
- The system notifies the Estimators by sending an email including the URL.
- The Moderator receives a confirmation from the system that the URL has been sent.

To generate a sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on the user story, we'd need to identify the key participants and operations as follows:

- Participants:
    1. Waiter
    2. System/Inventory

- Operations/Activities:
    1. Request item availability
    2. Verify item availability
    3. Display availability status to waiter

Based on these, a sequence diagram can be designed. Since I can't produce visual content in this text-based interface, below is a textual representation of a sequence diagram in PlantUML language:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Inventory System" as System

Waiter -> System: RequestItemAvailability(itemID)
activate System
System --> System: CheckAvailability(itemID)
System --> Waiter: ShowAvailabilityStatus(status)
deactivate System

@enduml
```

In this diagram:

1. The waiter requests the availability of an item (by providing the itemID) from the Inventory System.
2. The system then checks the availability of that item internally and gets the status.
3. The system then shows the availability status back to the waiter. 

You can render this diagram using any tool or online service that supports PlantUML.

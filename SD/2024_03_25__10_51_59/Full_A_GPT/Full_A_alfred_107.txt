Here is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story.

```
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant GameService
participant MemoryGame
participant PhysicalHealthGame

OlderPerson -> GameService: requestGames()
activate GameService
GameService -> MemoryGame: generateMemoryGame()
activate MemoryGame
MemoryGame --> GameService: returnMemoryGame()
deactivate MemoryGame
GameService -> PhysicalHealthGame: generatePhysicalHealthGame()
activate PhysicalHealthGame
PhysicalHealthGame --> GameService: returnPhysicalHealthGame()
deactivate PhysicalHealthGame
GameService --> OlderPerson: returnGames()
deactivate GameService

Explanation:

1. The older person sends a request to the GameService for some games.
2. GameService activates and sends a request to MemoryGame for generating a memory game.
3. MemoryGame upon activation returns a game to GameService.
4. GameService then sends a request to PhysicalHealthGame for generating a physical health related game.
5. PhysicalHealthGame upon activation returns a game to GameService.
6. Finally, GameService returns both games to the older person. 

(Note: This is assuming that there are separate systems or modules in place to generate the memory and physical health game. Depending on the infrastructure and scope of the project, the actual implementation might be different.)

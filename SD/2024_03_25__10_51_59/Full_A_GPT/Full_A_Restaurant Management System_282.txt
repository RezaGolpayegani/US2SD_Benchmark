To create a sequence diagram in Plant UML, we can follow this step by step guide for the user story: 'As a waiter, I want to deselect order items.' Here, we assume that there's a process where the waiter can select and deselect the items from a digital menu.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
entity OrderSystem
entity Menu

Waiter -> OrderSystem: AccessOrder(orderId)
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem --> Waiter: ShowOrderDetails(orderItems)
deactivate OrderSystem

Waiter -> OrderSystem: DeselectItem(itemId)
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> Menu: GetItem(itemId)
activate Menu
Menu --> OrderSystem: ReturnItemDetails
deactivate Menu
OrderSystem --> Waiter: ConfirmRemoveItem
deactivate OrderSystem

@enduml
```

This UML sequence diagram shows the interactions between the waiter and the ordering system. In the first step, the waiter accesses the order. The system then shows the order details. The waiter then deselects an item, and the system confirms this action.

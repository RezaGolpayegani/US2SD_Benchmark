The below is a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML format representing the basic interactions for the developer to get a data package into Clojure for doing analysis and visualizations:

```
@startuml
title User Operation for Data Processing in Clojure

participant "Developer" as D
database "Data Package Repository" as DB
participant "Clojure Environment" as C

D->DB: Request data package
note right: Developer sends a request for the desired data package
DB --> D: Send data package
note right: Data Package Repository sends the requested data package to the Developer

D->C: Load data package into Clojure
note right: Developer loads the data package into the Clojure environment for analysis and visualization
C --> D: Confirmation
note right: Clojure environment sends a confirmation to the Developer that data package is loaded successfully

alt Data package is prepared for use

D->C: Start analysing and visualizing data
note right: Developer starts utilizing the data package for analysis and visualization in Clojure Environment

else Data package is not prepared for use

D->C: Report error
note right: Developer reports an error if the data package is not loaded properly into the Clojure environment

end

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates how a developer requests a data package from a repository, loads it into a Clojure environment, and then confirms if it's ready for use. If the data package is properly loaded, the developer starts analyzing and visualizing the data. If not, they report an error. 

Please modify and extend the diagram where necessary to fit the actual requirements and conditions of your system.

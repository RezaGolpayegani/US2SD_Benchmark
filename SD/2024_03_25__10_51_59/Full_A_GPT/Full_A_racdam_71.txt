Since this platform doesn't support diagrams, I'll describe how the `PlantUML` sequence diagram should be and you can draw it in your local environment. 

Below is a sample plain text description of a sequence diagram for the given user story:

1. The `Researcher` communicates with the `System (archival database)` and requests cross-collection citation information for specific materials.

2. The `System` then communicates with the `Archivist` (or directly retrieves the information from the database where archivist stored it) and asks to provide citation information for those materials.

3. `Archivist` accesses the `Files (database)` and uses the citation processing system to gather all the necessary citation information.

4. The citation processing system interacts with the files/database and gathers the appropriate information

5. After processing and gathering done by `Citation Processing System`, information is delivered back to the `Archivist`.

6. `Archivist` then reviews the information, and passes it on to the `System`.

7. The `System` then conveys this information back to the `Researcher`, completing the sequence.

In `PlantUML`, the code would look something like this:

```
@startuml
Researcher -> System : request cross-collection citation
System -> Archivist: request citation details
Archivist -> CitationProcessingSystem : access files/database
CitationProcessingSystem -> Files: gather citation details
Files --> CitationProcessingSystem: return citation details
CitationProcessingSystem --> Archivist : return citation details 
Archivist --> System : return citation details
System --> Researcher : deliver citation details
@enduml
```

Please note, this is a highly abstracted and oversimplified representation of how the system may work. Real-world implementations would be much more complex. Also, the system operation might work automated without Archivist intervening the process, it depends on the system developed, here it's considered for explanatory purpose.

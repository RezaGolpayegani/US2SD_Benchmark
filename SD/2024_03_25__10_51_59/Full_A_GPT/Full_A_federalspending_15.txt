Here's a simple outline on how to generate the sequence diagram in Plant UML format. But first, you need to clarify who the actors are, what the system components are, and what the interactions are. Without that, I can only provide a generalized format:

You might have an actor named "owner", and system entities "USAspending" and "Owner's system". I'll provide a generalized sequence below:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Owner" as O
participant "USAspending" as USA
participant "Owner System" as OS

O -> USA: RequestToSendGrantsOnly
activate USA
USA -> USA: ValidateRequest
note right: Validating request only contains grant records.
USA --> O: AcknowledgeRequest
deactivate USA
activate OS
USA -> OS: SendGrantsOnly
note right: Sending only grant records.
OS --> USA: ConfirmReceipt
deactivate OS
activate USA
USA --> O: ConfirmationOfTransfer
deactivate USA
@enduml
```

In this sequence, Owner sends a request to USAspending to send only Grant records. USAspending validates the request, then acknowledges the Owner of receipt of the request. Afterwards, USAspending sends the grant records to the Ownerâ€™s system and gets a confirmation of the successful transfer. This confirmation is then forwarded to the Owner.

Please modify the actors, actions, sequence as per actual systems, components and interactions in your project.

The sequence diagram below described what happens once a dataset developer decides to explore a dataset instance created from a dataset type that was deployed.

It might be visualized as follows in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "DataSet Developer" as D
participant "App Artifacts" as AA #ADD8E6
participant "Dataset Type Deployment" as DD #FFFFFF
participant "Dataset Instance" as DI #FFEFD5

D -> AA : Include dataset type code in app artifacts
activate AA

AA -> DD : Deploy Dataset type
activate DD
DD --> AA : Return Deployment status
deactivate DD

AA -> DI : Create instance of deployed dataset type
activate DI
DI --> AA : Return instance creation status
deactivate DI

D -> DI: Explore dataset instance
activate DI
DI --> D: Return instance exploration results
deactivate DI

```
The steps are as follows:
1. DataSet Developer includes a dataset type code in application artifacts. 
2. App Artifacts deploy the included dataset type.
3. Deployment returns a status.
4. The app creates an instance of the dataset type.
5.  Dataset Instance returns a status of creation.
6. DataSet Developer explores the instance of the dataset.
7. The Dataset Instance returns exploration results.

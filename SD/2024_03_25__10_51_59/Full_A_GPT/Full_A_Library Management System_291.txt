Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to create graphical representations such as sequence diagrams. However, I am able to guide you on writing a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for your user story. 

Here is a textual walkthrough:

```plantuml
@startuml

title View Members' Comments 

actor Member as m
participant "Member's Interface" as mi
database "Database" as db

m -> mi : Checks other members' comments
activate mi
mi -> db : Fetches comments
activate db
db --> mi : Returns comments
deactivate db
mi --> m : Displays comments
deactivate mi
@enduml
```
This describes a Member (m) initiating the process by checking other members' comments, triggering the Member's Interface (mi) to fetch comments from the Database (db). The Database then returns the comments back to the Interface, which are then displayed to the Member.

This PlantUML sequence diagram shows the interactions between an OlderPerson and ALFRED. It starts when the OlderPerson requests for health tips. ALFRED processes the request and checks the OlderPerson's health profile. If the health profile is available, ALFRED determines suitable health tips and provides them to the OlderPerson. If the health profile is not available, ALFRED requests health information from the OlderPerson, creates a health profile, determines suitable health tips and provides them to the OlderPerson.

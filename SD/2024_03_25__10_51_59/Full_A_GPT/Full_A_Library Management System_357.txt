This is a textual representation of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
Title: Sequence Diagram for Specifying Unique ID for each book

actor Staff
entity System 

activate Staff
Staff -> System: Login()
activate System
System --> Staff: ShowFunctions()

Staff -> System: ChooseSpecifyIDFunction()
System --> Staff: ShowBooks()

Staff -> System: SelectBook()
System --> Staff: ShowBookDetails()

Staff -> System: InputUniqueID()
System -> System: CheckUniqueID()

alt ID is unique
    System --> Staff: ConfirmIDAssigned()
else ID is not unique
    System --> Staff: ShowError()
end

deactivate System
deactivate Staff

@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. The above sequence diagram starts off with the `Staff` logging in to the `System`.
2. The `System` then shows the functions available to the `Staff`.
3. The `Staff` chooses the function to specify a unique ID for each book, and the `System` then shows the list of books.
4. The `Staff` selects the book that they want to assign an ID to, and the `System` shows the details of that book.
5. The `Staff` inputs the unique ID, and the `System` checks if the entered ID is unique.
6. If the ID is unique, the `System` confirms that the ID has been assigned successfully. If not, it shows an error message.

Here is an example of how you can create the sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story:

```plantuml
title Total Sales and Total Profit Calculation Process

actor Manager
participant "Accounting System" as Accounting
participant "Employee Salary System" as SalarySys
participant "Cashier" as Cashier
participant "Chef" as Chef

Manager -> Accounting: Request total sales and total profit
activate Accounting
Accounting -> Cashier: Retrieve total sales data
activate Cashier
Cashier -->> Accounting: Return total sales data
deactivate Cashier
Accounting -> Chef: Retrieve total profit data
activate Chef
Chef -->> Accounting: Return total profit data
deactivate Chef
Accounting -->> Manager: Return total sales and total profit
deactivate Accounting
Manager -> SalarySys: Calculate salaries based on total sales and total profit
activate SalarySys
SalarySys -->> Manager: Return calculated salaries
deactivate SalarySys
@endplantuml
```
Please note that you will need to enter this code into a PlantUML editor or viewer to see the diagram. This sequence diagram assumes that there are separate processes for the cashier and chef to track sales and profit, respectively. If your system is different, you would adjust the code accordingly.

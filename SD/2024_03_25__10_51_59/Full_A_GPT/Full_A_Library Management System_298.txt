Here is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format. Please note that the actual code might differ based on the specifics of your system structure and classes. Here's a typical pattern though:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Check due date of borrowed book

actor Member
boundary "Member Portal" as MP 
control "Book Controller" as BC
database "Book Database" as BD 

Member -> MP: Request book status
activate MP
MP -> BC: Send book status request
activate BC
BC -> BD: Fetch book status
activate BD
BD -->> BC: Returns book status
deactivate BD
BC -->> MP: Send book status and due date
deactivate BC
MP -->> Member: Show book status and due date
deactivate MP

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the member first requests the book status from the Member Portal. The request is then passed to the Book Controller. The Book Controller fetches the book status and due date (if borrowed) from the Book Database and returns it to the Member Portal, which then shows it to the Member.

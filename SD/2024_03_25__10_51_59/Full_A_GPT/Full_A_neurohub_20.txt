Since AI cannot generate an image nor a PlantUML sequence diagram, I will describe the general steps to create this sequence diagram under this user story:

As a supervisor, I want to view what my researchers were doing on a given date or period of time.

1. Supervisor calls Authenticate() function to access the Department system
2. If Authentication is successful, the Department system shows the Dashboard to the Supervisor
3. Supervisor calls the ViewResearchersActivity(Date) function
4. The Department system will call GetResearchersActivity(Date) function from the Research Database
5. The Database retrieves and returns the activities data back to the Department system
6. The Department System presents data to Supervisor.

A sample PlantUML code for the sequence diagram might look like this:

```
@startuml
autonumber
participant "Supervisor" as S
participant "Department System" as DS
participant "Research Database" as RD

S -> DS : Authenticate()
DS -> S : Show Dashboard()
S -> DS : ViewResearchersActivity(Date)
DS -> RD : GetResearchersActivity(Date)
RD --> DS : Return Researchers Activity Data 
DS --> S : Present Activity Data
@enduml
```

Remember that PlantUML uses arrows (`-->` and `->`) to indicate the direction of the interaction. Remember to replace the `(Date)` with the actual date or a variable representing the date that the supervisor wants to review. This is just a simple representation and you may need to adjust this based on your application's specific requirements.

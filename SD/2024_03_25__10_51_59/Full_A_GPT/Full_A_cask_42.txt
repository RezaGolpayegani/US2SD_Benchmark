Here's how to generate a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format based on the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Schema Specification Process 

actor User

User -> DatasetType: SpecifySchema(schemaDetails)
note right: User specifies the schema

DatasetType -> Artifact: IncludeSchemaInArtifact(schemaDetails)
note right: Schema is included in the app artifact

Artifact -> DatasetType: CreateDataset(datasetDescription, schemaDetails)
note right: Dataset of the specified type is created

DatasetType -> Application: ShareSchema(datasetDescription, schemaDetails)
note right: Schema is shared among multiple \napplications that include the dataset type

User -> DatasetType: DeleteOldVersions(oldDatasetVersion)
note right: Old versions of the dataset type are tried to be deleted

alt If dataset instances exist with the old version
        DatasetType --> User: DeletionFailedError
        note right: Fails if any dataset instances \nexist with the old version
else No dataset instances with the old version
        DatasetType --> User: SuccessfulDeletion
        note right: Successfully deletes if no dataset \ninstances exist with the old version 
end

Note: You can copy this code and paste it in any PlantUML viewer to generate a sequence diagram.

Please, remember that this is only a broad and high-level diagram. The exact messages and their flow may vary based on the detailed requirements of your project and system architecture.

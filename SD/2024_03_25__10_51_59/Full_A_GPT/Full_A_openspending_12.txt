In a text based platform such as this, we can outline the sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax. For the described user story, it can be as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Google Spreadsheet" as GS
participant "Data Packager" as DP

User -> GS : Retrieve data from
activate GS
GS --> User : Send back the required data
deactivate GS

User -> DP : Import data
activate DP
DP -> DP : Validate data format
DP --> User : Acknowledge import completion
deactivate DP
@enduml
```

However, it is to note that PlantUML inherently is a graphical language which generates diagrams from a plain text language. Thus, take the provided sequence in a PlantUML environment and it will generate a graphical representation of the sequence.

In this sequence diagram, it outlines four primary interactions:

1. The User retrieves data from a Google Spreadsheet.
2. The Google Spreadsheet sends back the required data.
3. The User then imports this data to the Data Packager.
4. The Data Packager validates the data format and acknowledge the import completion back to the user.

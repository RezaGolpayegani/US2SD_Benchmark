As an AI, I can provide the textual representation for the sequence diagram (in PlantUML format) but I can't depict images or diagrams. Here's an example for the described user story:

```
@startuml
title Depositor deposits and maintains datasets

actor Depositor
participant "Web Interface" as A
database "Database" as B

Depositor -> A: RequestAccess()
activate A

A --> B: ValidateAccess()
activate B

B --> A: ReturnAccessValidation()
deactivate B

A --> Depositor: AccessGranted()
deactivate A

Depositor -> A: DepositsDataset()
activate A

A --> B: SaveDataset()
activate B

B --> A: DataSetStoredConfirmation()
deactivate B

A --> Depositor: DataSetStoredNotification()
deactivate A

Depositor -> A: UpdateDataset()
activate A

A --> B: ModifyDataset()
activate B

B --> A: DatasetUpdatedConfirmation()
deactivate B

A --> Depositor: DatasetUpdatedNotification()
deactivate A

Depositor -> A: Exit()
activate A

A --> Depositor: LogoutConfirmation()
deactivate A

@enduml
```

In the described sequence diagram:
 - "Depositor", "Web Interface(A)" and "Database(B)" are actors involved
 - Access is requested and validated, datasets are then deposited and saved in the database
 - The depositor can also update a dataset  

Please note that this example assumes that the web interface and database are programmed to perform the described functions. The functions' names and functionality might need to be adjusted to fit the project's specifics.

You could copy the code and paste it into an online PlantUML editor to visualize the diagram.

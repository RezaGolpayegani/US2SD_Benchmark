The Plant UML format for the sequence diagram is depicted below:

```
@startuml
actor Reader
entity "Book System" as book_system

Reader -> book_system : Selects Book
activate book_system
book_system -> book_system : Fetch Book Details
note right
The system fetches the 
selected book's details.
end note

book_system --> Reader : Display Book Details
deactivate book_system
Reader -> book_system : Write Comment
activate book_system

book_system -> book_system : Add Comment to Book
note right
The system adds the reader's 
comment to the selected book.
end note

book_system --> Reader : Confirm Comment Added
deactivate book_system

@enduml
```

In this sequence, the "Reader" (also known as the actor) initiates the sequence diagram by first selecting a book they wish to comment on. The "Book System" retrieves the relevant book details and displays them to the Reader. The Reader then writes a comment, which is added to the book by the Book System. A confirmation message is then dispatched to the Reader to confirm that the comment has been added successfully.

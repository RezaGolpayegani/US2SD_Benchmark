This is a text-based pseudo-code representation of a sequence diagram in PlantUML language:

```
@startuml
title Reserve Multiple Books Workflow

actor LibraryMember as LM
participant "Library System" as LS

note over LM,LS: Start of reservation process.

LM -> LS: RequestBookReservation(list of book titles)
activate LS
LS -> LS: CheckBookAvailability(list of book titles)
note right: System checks if books are available.
LS --> LM: SendBookAvailabilityStatus(list with status of each book)
deactivate LS
LM -> LS: ConfirmReservation(list with books to reserve)
activate LS
LS -> LS: ProcessReservation(list with books to reserve)
note right: System processes the reservation.
LS --> LM: ReservationConfirmation(list with reserved books)
deactivate LS

note over LM,LS: End of reservation process.

```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The library member (LM) sends a request to the library system (LS) to reserve multiple books, providing a list of the book titles they wish to reserve.
2. The Library System checks the availability of the books.
3. The Library System sends back to the library member the availability status of each book.
4. After verifying the availability, the library member confirms their reservation.
5. The Library System then processes the reservation.
6. Finally, the library system sends a confirmation of the reservation to the library member.
   
This is a simplified sequence diagram and may need to be modified depending on the exact details and requirements of the system in question.

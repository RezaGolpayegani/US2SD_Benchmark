The following is a simple Plant UML representation of a sequence diagram based on the user story given in the project.

Please note, a sequence diagram requires knowledge of specific method calls, parameters, and objects in your code, which I can't provide you with as those are dependent on your codebase. However, here is a general, high-level PlantUML sequence diagram you can build from:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Contributor
Contributor -> System: Request_DRP(planId)
System -> Database: Fetch_DRP(planId)
Database --> System: Return_DRP(plan)
System --> Contributor: Show_DRP(plan)
Contributor -> System: Refer_DRP_to_Grant_proposal(grantId, planId)
System -> Database: Add_DRP_Ref_to_GrantProposal(grantId, planId)
Database --> System: Confirm_Update
System --> Contributor: Confirm_DRP_Ref_Added
Contributor -> System: Refer_DRP_to_DataMgt_plan(planId)
System -> Database: Add_DRP_Ref_To_DataMgtPlan(planId)
Database --> System: Confirm_Update
System --> Contributor: Confirm_DRP_Ref_Added

```

In this sequence diagram:

- `Contributor`: The actor (User or data contributor) who needs to refer to the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) in grant proposals and Data Management Plans.
- `Request_DRP(planId)`: The method where the actor requests disaster recovery plan from the system.
- `Fetch_DRP(planId)`: The system fetches the plan from the database.
- `Show_DRP(plan)`: The system shows the disaster recovery plan to the contributor.
- `Refer_DRP_to_Grant_proposal(grantId, planId)`: Actor refers the disaster recovery plan to a grant proposal.
- `Refer_DRP_to_DataMgt_plan(planId)`: Actor refers the disaster recovery plan to the data management plan.
- `Add_DRP_Ref_to_GrantProposal(grantId, planId)`,
- `Add_DRP_Ref_To_DataMgtPlan(planId)`: The system adds these references to the database.
- `Confirm_DRP_Ref_Added`: The system confirms to the contributor that the references have been successfully added.  

Please fill out the sequences as per your convenience, since I do not know the specific sequences involved in the real scenario, so I made up the ones which made the most sense.

Since the AI model can't create images, the sequence diagram can be described in PlantUML text language. This is a brief sketch, modify it according to your classes and methods:

```
@startuml 
participant DigitalRecordsArchivist as A
participant Collections as B 
participant Depositors as C 

A -> B : getCollection(collectionID)
activate B
B --> A : collectionDetails
deactivate B

loop for each depositor
    A -> C : addDepositorToGroup(depositorID, groupID)
    activate C
    C --> A : status
    deactivate C
end

A -> B : setCloseDate(collectionID, date)
activate B
B --> A : status
deactivate B

loop for each depositor
    A -> C : setPermission(depositorID, collectionID)
    activate C
    C --> A : status
    deactivate C
end  

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the DigitalRecordsArchivist (A) interacts with Collections (B) to fetch a specific collection and set a close date for the deposit window. Also, the Archivist adds multiple depositors to specific groups and sets permissions for each one, interacting with the Depositors (C). 

Each arrow represents a call to a method or a return of a message, and the loop indicates that this operation is done for each depositor. However, you might need to adjust the code based on your specific project needs, including method and class names.

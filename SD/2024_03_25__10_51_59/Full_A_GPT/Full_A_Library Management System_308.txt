Here's a base example of how you could create your PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to take suggestions." Bear in mind that this is a simplified example, and your real implementation might be more complex depending on different factors, such as the specification of your system, the technology stack used, etc.

```
@startuml
Member -> System : Request suggestions
activate System
System --> Database : Retrieve suggestions
activate Database
Database --> System : Return data
deactivate Database
System --> Member : Display Suggestions
deactivate System
@enduml
```
This does a simple sequence:
1. The Member sends a request for suggestions to the System.
2. After receiving the request, the System makes a request to the Database to retrieve suggestions.
3. The Database returns these suggestions to the System.
4. The System then displays the Suggestions to the Member.
   
Each of these steps might potentially involve more steps and possibly other actors (like an authentication procedure, logging, etc.). The PlantUML diagram is flexible enough to capture these complexities when needed.

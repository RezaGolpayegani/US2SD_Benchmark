Here is a simple sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story. Please note that the actual diagram might be more complex and detailed, this is only an illustrative diagram for clarity.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor Member
participant "Online Reservation System" as ORS
database "Book Database" as BD

Member -> ORS : Request to Update Reservation
activate ORS
ORS -> BD : Check Availability
activate BD
BD -->> ORS : Return Availability Confirmation
deactivate BD
ORS -->> Member : Confirm Availability
 deactivate ORS

alt Available 

Member -> ORS : Confirm Update Reservation Request
activate ORS
ORS -> BD : Update Reservation
activate BD
BD -->> ORS : Update Confirmation
deactivate BD
ORS -->> Member : Confirm Updated Reservation 
deactivate ORS

else Not Available
ORS -->> Member : No Update Possible Notification
deactivate ORS
end
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
1. Member sends a request to update a reservation to the Online Reservation System (ORS).
2. ORS checks availability in the Book Database (BD).
3. BD returns confirmation about availability back to ORS.
4. ORS confirms the availability to the member.
5. If the book is available, the member confirms the reservation update, then ORS updates the reservation in BD. BD sends update confirmation back to the ORS and ORS confirms the updated reservation to the Member.
6. If book is not available, ORS sends a notification to the member about no updates being possible.
7. If-alt loop is used to depict different scenarios.

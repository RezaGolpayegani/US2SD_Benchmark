Based on the User Story you specified, here's the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml 
title Assign Book to Unique ID in Library

actor LibraryManager
database Database

LibraryManager -> Database: Assign Unique ID
Database --> LibraryManager: Check if ID exists

alt ID exists  
   Database --> LibraryManager: Send error message
else ID doesn't exist
   LibraryManager -> Database: Store ID with Book Information
   Database --> LibraryManager: Confirm Successful Assignment
end

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the process where the library manager assigns a unique identification number to a book. The manager asks the database to assign a unique ID. If that unique ID already exists in the database, it returns an error message to the manager. If the ID doesn't exist, the manager stores the book information with the ID in the database, and the database confirms the successful assignment of the new ID.

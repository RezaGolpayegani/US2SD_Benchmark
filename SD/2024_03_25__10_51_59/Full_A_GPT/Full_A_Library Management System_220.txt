Here's a basic example of how you can structure your Plant UML sequence diagram code to represent the user story: "As a manager, I want to see missing book numbers."

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

M -> S: Request Missing Books
activate S
S -> D: Get All Books
activate D
D --> S: Return All Books
deactivate D
S -> S: Calculate Missing Numbers
S --> M: Display Missing Numbers
deactivate S
@enduml
```
This diagram begins with a manager making a request to the system to see the missing book numbers. The system then makes a request to the database to get all books. Once the book data is returned to the system, it then calculates the missing book numbers and sends this information back to the manager.

Please note that this is a simplified example and you might need to extend or adjust this to fit your specific system design and requirements. There might be several more states or actors involved depending on the complexity of your system.

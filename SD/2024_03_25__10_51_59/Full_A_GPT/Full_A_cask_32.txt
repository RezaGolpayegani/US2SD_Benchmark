Here is an example of how the sequence diagram for this user story could be represented using PlantUML language. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor PluginDeveloper
participant AppArtifact
participant DatasetType
participant DatasetInstance

PluginDeveloper -> AppArtifact : Include type code
AppArtifact -> DatasetType : Create DatasetType instance
AppArtifact --> PluginDeveloper : Return dataset type instance   

PluginDeveloper -> DatasetType : Deploy Type
DatasetType -> DatasetInstance : Create Instance

DatasetType --> PluginDeveloper : Return instance identifier
PluginDeveloper --> AppArtifact : Share DatasetType instance

PluginDeveloper -> DatasetType : Delete outdated version
alt Some Instances of Outdated Version Exist
    DatasetType --> PluginDeveloper : Operation fail
else No Instances of Outdated Version Exist
    DatasetType --> PluginDeveloper : Operation Success
end
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows:

1. The plugin developer includes the dataset type code in the app artifact.
2. The app artifact creates a dataset type instance and returns that to the plugin developer.
3. The plugin developer then deploys the dataset type, which creates a dataset instance and returns the identifier to the developer.
4. Then the dataset type instance is shared by the plugin developer with the app artifact.
5. Finally, the developer attempts to delete an outdated version of the dataset type. If any instances of this outdated version exist, the operation fails and is notified to the developer, otherwise operation is successful. 

Please note that this is a basic representation, further details could be added based on the specific requirements and conditions of your system.

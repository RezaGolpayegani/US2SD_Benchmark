Below is a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the User Story: As a chef, I want to update status of ordered items as can be served.

```
@startuml
participant ":App User" as A
participant ":System" as B
participant ":Chef" as C

A -> B: Send Refresh Orders Request
activate B
B -> C: Fetch Current Orders
activate C
C --> B: Send Current Orders List
deactivate C
B --> A: Display Current Orders List
deactivate B
A -> A: Select Specific Order
A -> B: Send Order Update Request (Can be Served)
activate B
B -> C: Update Order Status
activate C
C --> B: Acknowledge Update
deactivate C
B --> A: Confirm Order Status Update
deactivate B
@enduml
```

Here are the steps in the diagram:

1. App User sends a request to refresh orders to the System.
2. System fetches current orders from the Chef.
3. Chef sends back the current orders list to the System.
4. System displays orders list to the App User.
5. App User selects a specific order from the list.
6. App User sends an order update request to mark this order as "Can be Served" to the System.
7. System communicates this status update to the Chef. 
8. Chef acknowledges the status update. 
9. System confirms the order status update to the App User.

Please note that this sequence diagram assumes that the requested user story is performed within the context of a software system, and includes user-system interactions. The specific names and number of operations can be modified based on the actual design and needs of your system.

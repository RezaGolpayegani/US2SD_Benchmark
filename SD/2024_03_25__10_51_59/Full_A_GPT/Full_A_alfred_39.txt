I'm an AI and currently, I can't draw pictures or diagrams. However, I can write down how a sequence diagram should look for the stated User Story in a way you can easily understand. If you're familiar with Plant UML, you can easily translate it into code.

Sequence diagrams are useful for visualizing interactions between different parts of a system. Here's how one for your User Story might look:

1. The OlderPerson interacts with the ALFRED Application to request navigation directions.
2. The ALFRED Application then sends a message to the Navigation Service requesting navigation directions. This could be a system within ALFRED or a separate service ALFRED interacts with.
3. The Navigation Service calculates the directions.
4. It then returns the directions back to the ALFRED Application.
5. ALFRED Application displays the directions to the OlderPerson.

Here's a simple example in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
OlderPerson -> ALFREDApplication: Request Navigation Directions
ALFREDApplication -> NavigationService: Request Navigation Directions
NavigationService --> ALFREDApplication: Return Navigation Directions
ALFREDApplication --> OlderPerson: Display Navigation Directions
@enduml
```

A more detailed sequence diagram could include additional steps, such as the OlderPerson specifying their destination, ALFRED acknowledging the request, the Navigation Service accessing a database of routes, and error handling steps. This will depend on the specifics of how the ALFRED system works.

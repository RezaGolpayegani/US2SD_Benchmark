Unfortunately, it's not possible to create a sequence diagram as plain text within this text-based AI model. However, I can provide you with a textual description of how the Plant UML code might look like.

```
@startuml
title Book Checkout Sequence Diagram

actor "Library Manager" as manager
entity "Book Inventory System" as inventory
database "Database" as db

manager -> inventory: Request book list
activate inventory
inventory -> db: Fetch book list
activate db
db --> inventory: Return book list
deactivate db
inventory --> manager: Show book list
deactivate inventory

manager -> inventory: Select book for checkout
activate inventory
inventory -> db: Query book availability
activate db
db --> inventory: Return book status
deactivate db
inventory --> manager: Show book status
deactivate inventory

alt If book is available
    manager -> inventory: Checkout book
    activate inventory
    inventory -> db: Update book status
    activate db
    db --> inventory: Confirm status update
    deactivate db
    inventory --> manager: Confirm checkout
    deactivate inventory
else If book is not available
    manager -> inventory: Request other book
    deactivate inventory
end

The sequence begins with the Library Manager requesting a book list from the Book Inventory System which in turn fetches the books list from the Database. The fetched book list is then displayed to the Manager who selects a book for checkout. The Inventory System queries the book's availability from the Database. If the book is available, it's checked out and the status is updated in the Database. If the book isn't available, the Library Manager can request for another book. The "alt" block is used to show these branching scenarios.

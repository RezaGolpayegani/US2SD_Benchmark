Unfortunately, the AI can't generate diagrams currently. But here's a textual-based sequence diagram you might translate into the PlantUML format:

Title: View and Restore Version of an Object 

Participants: Repository Manager, Staff Interface, Version Control System 

Sequence:

1. Repository Manager -> Staff Interface: Request to view object versions
2. Staff Interface -> Version Control System: Fetch object versions
3. Version Control System -> Staff Interface: Return object versions
4. Staff Interface -> Repository Manager: Display object versions
5. Repository Manager -> Staff Interface: Select a version and request to restore
6. Staff Interface -> Version Control System: Restore selected version 
7. Version Control System -> Staff Interface: Confirmation of version restoration
8. Staff Interface -> Repository Manager: Confirmation of version restoration 

Note: translate this sequence into PlantUML format using your preferred UML tool. 

 This textual sequence can then be translated into PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
title View and Restore Version of an Object 

actor RepositoryManager as RM
entity StaffInterface as SI
database VersionControlSystem as VCS

RM -> SI: Request to view object versions
SI -> VCS: Fetch object versions
VCS --> SI: Return object versions
SI --> RM: Display object versions
RM -> SI: Select a version and request to restore
SI -> VCS: Restore selected version
VCS --> SI: Confirmation of version restoration
SI --> RM: Confirmation of version restoration

Unfortunately, it's impossible to create images or diagrammatic content through this text-based system. However, I can provide you with a textual description of what the PlantUML code would look like. You would need to plug this into a PlantUML compiler to see the diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant System

Archivist -> System : Request file restriction
activate System
System -> System : Verify user privileges
System --> Archivist : Confirm user privileges

alt sufficient privileges
    Archivist -> System : Specify file to restrict
    activate System
    System -> System : Restrict file from view
    System --> Archivist : Confirm file restriction
else insufficient privileges
    System --> Archivist : Deny request
end

deactivate System
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram begins with the Archivist requesting a file restriction from the system. The system verifies the user's privileges and responds either with a confirmation if the privileges are sufficient, or a denial if they are insufficient. If the privileges are sufficient, the Archivist specifies which file they want to restrict, the system restricts that file from view, and the system confirms the restriction to the Archivist.

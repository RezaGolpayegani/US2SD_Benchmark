As an AI developed by OpenAI, I have limitations which make it impossible for me directly create graphical content or Sequence Diagrams. However, I can certainly guide you in creating a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML for this User Story.

This is your PlantUML sequence diagram in text format:

```
@startuml
actor DigitalRecordsArchivist
participant RepositoryAdmin

DigitalRecordsArchivist -> RepositoryAdmin: verifyAdminStatus()
activate RepositoryAdmin
RepositoryAdmin --> DigitalRecordsArchivist: AdminStatus(true)
deactivate RepositoryAdmin

activate DigitalRecordsArchivist
DigitalRecordsArchivist -> RepositoryAdmin: grantEmbargoPrivileges()
note right: The DigitalRecords Archivist\ngrants embargo privileges\nto a Repository Admin.

activate RepositoryAdmin
RepositoryAdmin --> DigitalRecordsArchivist: confirmEmbargoPrivileges()
note right: The Repository Admin\nconfirms that they have \nreceived the embargo privileges.
deactivate RepositoryAdmin
@enduml
```

Firstly, the sequence begins with the DigitalRecordsArchivist actor who sends `verifyAdminStatus()` message to the RepositoryAdmin actor, which then responds with `AdminStatus(true)` if they are a repository admin or `AdminStatus(false)` otherwise.

Once verified, the DigitalRecordsArchivist continues to `grantEmbargoPrivileges()` to the RepositoryAdmin.

Finally, the RepositoryAdmin confirms receipt of the embargo privileges by sending `confirmEmbargoPrivileges` to the DigitalRecordsArchivist.

Insert this code into a PlantUML renderer to visualize the sequence diagram. 
If you want to describe more detailed interactions, it would be necessary to include more participants, e.g. database or service entities.

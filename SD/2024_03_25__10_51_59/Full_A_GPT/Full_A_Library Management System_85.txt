In this response, the interactions between different entities: Librarian, Database, and the Notification Center are shown. Here's how the sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the User Story would look:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian
database Database
entity NotificationCenter

== Seeing Expired Books ==

Librarian -> Database: Extract expired books
activate Database
Database --> Librarian: Return list of expired books
deactivate Database

== Sending Notification ==

loop for each book in expired books
    Librarian -> NotificationCenter: Send a notification about expiry
    activate NotificationCenter
    NotificationCenter --> Librarian: Notification Sent
    deactivate NotificationCenter
end

@enduml
```

This code can be run on any PlantUML environment to generate the sequence diagram. The diagram shows the steps that happen when librarian wants to see expired books and send notifications. 

From the diagram, the librarian communicates with the database to return a list of books with expired dates and then for each book in the expired books list, the librarian communicates with the NotificationCenter to send out notifications.

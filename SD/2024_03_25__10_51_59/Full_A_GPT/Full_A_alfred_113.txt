I'm an AI and currently, I'm unable to create visual diagrams or drawings. However, I can definitely guide you on how to create a sequence diagram in Plant UML format, based on the user story you've shared. Here's how you might go about it:

```
@startuml
Title User Story: Engaging in combined mental and physical exercise via games

participant OlderPerson
participant ALFRED
participant Game

note over OlderPerson: Wants to play games requiring combined mental and physical activity.

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Request to play game.
ALFRED -> Game: Fetch appropriate game.

alt Failure
    Game -> ALFRED: Failure to fetch game.
    ALFRED -> OlderPerson: Inform about failure.
else Success
    Game -> ALFRED: Success, game fetched.
    ALFRED -> OlderPerson: Starts the game.
    note over OlderPerson, Game: Engages in game requiring combined mental and physical activity.
end
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- The OlderPerson interacts with ALFRED to request a game.
- ALFRED communicates with Game to fetch an appropriate game.
- If the game fetch fails, ALFRED informs the OlderPerson about the failure.
- If the game fetch succeeds, ALFRED starts the game and the OlderPerson engages in it.

Remember to replace `Game` and `ALFRED` with the real names of your system's components.

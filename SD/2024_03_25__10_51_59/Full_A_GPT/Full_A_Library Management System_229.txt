Since it's not possible to create and display a sequence diagram within a text-based medium, I'll provide the PlantUML code which can be easily converted into sequence diagram using an online PlantUML compiler.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
boundary System
database InventoryDB
Manager -> System : Request Monthly Book Addition Report
activate System
System -> InventoryDB : Get all books added this month
activate InventoryDB
InventoryDB --> System : Retrieve book data
deactivate InventoryDB
System --> Manager : Display book data
deactivate System
@enduml
```

This diagram shows a Manager requesting a Monthly Book Additions Report from the System. The System sends a request to the Inventory Database (InventoryDB) to pull all book data added in the month. The Inventory Database retrieves and sends this data back to the System which displays it to the Manager.

You can convert it into sequence diagram using some online compiler like "http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/". Just copy paste this code in the online editor on this website and press "submit" to generate the diagram.

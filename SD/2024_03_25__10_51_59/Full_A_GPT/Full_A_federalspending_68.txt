Sure, based on the user story, here is the sample sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```uml
@startuml
title "FABS User Submission Error Reporting"

actor FABS_User as user

participant FABS_System as system

database FABS_Database as database

user -> system : InitiateSubmission()
activate system
system -> database : ValidateSubmission()
activate database
database --> system: Validation_Error()
deactivate database
system --> user: DisplaySubmissionError(ErrorMessage)
deactivate system
@enduml
```
Moreover, to explain the diagram:

- The FABS_User (actor) initiates a submission via the `InitiateSubmission` method
- The system receives the submission and validates it with the database by calling `ValidateSubmission`
- If there are any errors, the validation process returns a `Validation_Error`
- The system handles this error and displays the error message to the FABS_User by calling `DisplaySubmissionError(errorMessage)`

Please replace method names, parameters, and code details with actual ones when you implement it in your system. The code provided above represents a simple demonstration of a sequence diagram, which might differ based on actual system complexity. 

P.S: To visualize this script, please copy the code and paste it into the PlantUML editor.

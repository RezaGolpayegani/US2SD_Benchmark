Here is a simple version of a sequence diagram for the user story "As an agency user, I want to get File F in the correct format." in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
participant "Agency User" as A
participant "System" as S

A -> S: RequestFileF()
activate S 
S -> S: CheckFileFormatF()
note right of S: System checks format of File F
S --> A: ReturnFileF()
deactivate S 
note left of A: User got File F in the correct format
@enduml
```

This describes a very basic interaction where the Agency User makes a request for File F (`RequestFileF()`), the System processes this request by checking the file format (`CheckFileFormatF()`) and, if the format is correct, returns File F to the Agency User (`ReturnFileF()`). This is indicated with a note to show that the user got the file in the correct format. Please feel free to adjust to the specific needs of your process and system.

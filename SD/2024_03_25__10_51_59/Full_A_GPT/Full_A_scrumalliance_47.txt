```

This sequence diagram outlines the interaction between a Site Admin, the Website, and the Database. It illustrates the steps of the Site Admin selecting and displaying help wanted ads, choosing a specific ad to modify, and then either editing or deleting the ad. In each scenario, the Website serves as a middleman, relaying requests and responses between the Site Admin and the Database.

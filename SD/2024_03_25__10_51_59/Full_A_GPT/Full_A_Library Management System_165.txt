Due to the text-based limitation in this interface, it is not possible to create an actual diagram. However, I can guide you about how to create a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML language for this user story.

Here is an example of how you can model this:

```plantuml
@startuml
Title: Order Books by Title 

actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Library System" as system
participant Database

== Order Books by Title ==

member -> system: requestBooksByTitle()
activate system
system -> Database: getBooksByTitle()
activate Database
Database -->> system: returnListOfBooksByTitle()
deactivate Database
system -->> member: displayBooksByTitle()
deactivate system

@enduml
```

In the above sequence diagram:

1. The "Library Member" is the actor who interacts with the system to request the list of books by title.
2. The "Library System" is the participant that receives the request and communicates with the database.
3. The "Database" is where all the books are stored and where the system retrieves information.
4. The "requestBooksByTitle()" and "getBooksByTitle()" illustrate the action that corresponds to ordering the books by title.
5. The "returnListOfBooksByTitle()" shows the response from the database to the system.
6. The "displayBooksByTitle()" displays the ordered book list to the member.

In PlantUML, you can describe sequence diagrams using text. The description of the sequence diagram corresponding to the user story: "As a repository manager, I want to indicate that a name pertinent to a collection, object, or object component has a specific role, such as illustrator, photographer, etc." could look something like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor RepositoryManager
entity DAMS
database RolesRepository

RepositoryManager -> DAMS : AssignRoleToName(collectionId, objectId, name, role)
activate DAMS

DAMS -> RolesRepository : CreateRole(name, role)
activate RolesRepository
RolesRepository --> DAMS : Acknowledge Creation
deactivate RolesRepository

DAMS --> RepositoryManager : Role assigned successfully
deactivate DAMS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram assumes that the manager interacts with the DAMS to assign a role to a name, and that the DAMS communicates with a roles repository or database to record this role. When the process is successful, the DAMS sends confirmation back to the repository manager.

Please note, the sequence diagram may vary based on the exact architecture and process flow within your system. This is a simple and generic example. It could be more complex if you need to handle failure cases, or if multiple systems need to be coordinated.

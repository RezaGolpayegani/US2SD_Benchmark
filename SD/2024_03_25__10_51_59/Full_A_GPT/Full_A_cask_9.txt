In this scenario, the sequence diagram will involve several actions and actors including the App Developer, Application 1, Application 2, and the App Deployment System. The actions depicted in the diagram will reflect the user story. For this user story, here is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format:
```plantuml
@startuml

actor AppDeveloper
participant AppDeploymentSystem
participant Application1
participant DataSetInstance
participant Application2

AppDeveloper -> AppDeploymentSystem: Deploy App
activate AppDeploymentSystem
AppDeploymentSystem-> Application1: Check Dataset Type Version
activate Application1
Application1 --> AppDeploymentSystem: Current Dataset Type Version
deactivate Application1
activate DataSetInstance
AppDeploymentSystem -> DataSetInstance: Compare with new version
DataSetInstance --> AppDeploymentSystem: Version conflict error
deactivate DataSetInstance
AppDeploymentSystem --> AppDeveloper: Deployment Failed: Version Conflict Error
deactivate AppDeploymentSystem
AppDeveloper -> Application2: Update Dataset Type Version
activate Application2
Application2 --> AppDeveloper: Dataset Updated Successfully
deactivate Application2

@enduml
```
This UML sequence diagram reflects the process described in the user story. It starts with the app developer deploying the application. The application deployment system checks the version of the dataset type from application 1. Then, it compares this with the new version in DataSetInstance. A version conflict error occurs if the current version and the new version do not match, causing the deployment to fail. After that, the app developer updates the dataset type version in application 2. The updated process is successful.

Sure, here is a PlantUML formatted sequence diagram that matches your User story:

As this is a text chat, I'll list the code directly:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor Owner
participant Publisher as P
participant "Email Service" as ES
entity "Invitee (New Member)" as NM

Owner -> P: Invite Member(via email)
activate P
P -> ES: Send Invitation email
activate ES
ES --> NM: Email with Sign Up link
deactivate ES

NM --> ES: Clicks on Sign Up link
activate ES
NM <-- P: Present Sign Up page
deactivate P
NM -> P: Submit Sign up information
activate P

P --> NM: Confirm membership
P -> Owner: Confirm member addition
deactivate P
@enduml
```
As per this code:
- The Owner starts by sending an invitation to the new member which is handled by the Publisher.
- The Publisher then invokes Email Service to send an email to the new member.
- The new member receives the email and clicks the signup link present in the email, whereupon the Publisher displays the signup page.
- After the new member submits their signup information, the Publisher confirms their membership and notifies the Owner. This flow ensures the required member addition in the system is done effectively and systematically.

You can copy this code and paste it in any PlantUML editor to view the sequence diagram.

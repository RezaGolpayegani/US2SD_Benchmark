Here is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the described user story:

```
@startuml
title Upload Data To Repository and Associate With Publication

actor FacultyMember
boundary RepositoryUI
control Repository
entity Publication

FacultyMember -> RepositoryUI: Access Repository
RepositoryUI -> Repository: IsAuthenticUser(FacultyMember)
alt IsAuthentic
  Repository -> RepositoryUI: AccessGranted
  FacultyMember -> RepositoryUI: UploadData
  RepositoryUI -> Repository: SaveDataToRepository(FacultyMember, Data)
  Repository -> RepositoryUI: DataSavedSuccessfully
  FacultyMember -> RepositoryUI: AssociateWithData(Publication)
  RepositoryUI -> Repository: AssociateWithData(Publication, Data)
  Repository -> Publication: UpdateAssociation(Data)
  Publication -> Repository: DataAssociationUpdated
  Repository -> RepositoryUI: DataAssociatedWithPublication
  RepositoryUI -> FacultyMember: ShowSuccessMessage
else NotAuthentic
  Repository -> RepositoryUI: AccessDenied
  RepositoryUI -> FacultyMember: ShowErrorMessage
end
@enduml
```

In this PlantUML sequence diagram, the actions start with the faculty member trying to access the repository via the RepositoryUI. The Repository will check whether they are an authentic user. If they are authentic, they will be allowed to upload data and associate it with a Publication. If the processes are successful, they will receive a successful message accordingly. If they are not approved as an authentic user, they will receive an error message instead.

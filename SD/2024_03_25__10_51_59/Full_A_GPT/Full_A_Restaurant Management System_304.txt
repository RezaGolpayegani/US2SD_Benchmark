Unfortunately, I can't show images or diagrams here in this text-based service. But I can guide you on how to create a sequence diagram based on the user story you provided.

1. Define the actors, objects, or classes involved. Based on the user story, involved parties could be: waiter, order system and orders.
```
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Order System" as OS
database Orders
@enduml
```
2. Define the actions between those parties based on the user story. The waiter wants to see the orders which probably in the Orders database. So the waiter sends a request to the Order System, then the Order System fetches the data from Orders, and returns the data to the Waiter.

```
Waiter->OS: Request Orders
OS->Orders: Fetch Order Data
Orders-->OS: Return Order Data
OS-->Waiter: Show Orders
```

3. Combine the two parts. Based on the actor and action definitions from step1 and step2, the actual UML sequence diagram script in PlantUML format would look like the following:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Order System" as OS
database Orders

Waiter->OS: Request Orders
OS->Orders: Fetch Order Data
Orders-->OS: Return Order Data
OS-->Waiter: Show Orders
@enduml
```
Please note that the actual UML sequence might be different based on your system details, you might want to adjust the diagram accordingly.

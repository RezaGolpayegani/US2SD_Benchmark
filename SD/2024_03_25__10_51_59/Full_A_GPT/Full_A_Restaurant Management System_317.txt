I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I am not capable of creating diagrams, including sequence diagrams in Plant UML format. However, I can guide you through the process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter

entity "Waiter System" as waiter_system

database "Database"

Waiter -> waiter_system: Update Waiting Time
waiter_system -> Database: Update Waiting Time Request
Database -> waiter_system: Waiting Time Updated
waiter_system --> Waiter: Show Updated Waiting Time
@enduml
```

In this sample sequence diagram:
1. The waiter interacts with the waiter system (probably an app or software) to update a waiting time.
2. The waiter system sends an update request to the database.
3. The database processes the request and sends back confirmation that the waiting time has been updated.
4. Finally, the waiter system shows the updated waiting time to the waiter for confirmation.

You can adjust this code to adapt your needs in case other steps or actors are involved in your specific scenario.

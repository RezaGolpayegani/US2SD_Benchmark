I am an artificial intelligence and actually unable to create drawings, but I can describe how to construct your sequence diagram in the Plant UML format.

The sequence diagram will consist of several participating components: `Data Librarian`, `DMP` (Data Management Plan), `External Systems` and `Data Catalogue`.

```
@startuml
participant "Data Librarian" as D
participant "DMP" as P
participant "External Systems" as E
participant "Data Catalogue" as C

D -> P : Extract pointers to metadata
activate P
P --> D : Provide pointers
deactivate P

loop for each pointer
  D -> E: Request metadata using pointer
  activate E
  E --> D: Provide metadata
  deactivate E
  D -> C: Import metadata to catalogue
  activate C
  C --> D: Confirm successful import
  deactivate C
end
@enduml
```

This represents the data librarian sending a request to the data management plan to extract pointers to metadata. The DMP returns these pointers to the data librarian.

Then, for each pointer, the data librarian sends a request to the external system to provide the metadata. The external system returns the metadata to the data librarian. 

After that, the Data Librarian imports the retrieved Metadata into the Data Catalogue. The Data Catalogue confirms that the import has been successful. 

Remember to replace `<`,`-`, and `>`  with `<`, `-`, and `>` respectively. I used them here instead because standard formatting couldn't allow me to render `PlantUML`. I hope you find this helpful.

Here's a basic sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on the user story:

```
@startuml
actor Waiter as w
participant "Menu System" as m

w -> m : requestMenu()
activate m
m--> w : showMenu()
deactivate m
@enduml
```

This diagram represents an interaction where a waiter requests a menu from the system, which then presents the menu to the waiter. Adjustments could be made to this sequence based on the specifics of the system, for example, the Menu System could interact with a Database to retrieve the menu, or the Menu System could return specific item data to the Waiter in the showMenu() message.

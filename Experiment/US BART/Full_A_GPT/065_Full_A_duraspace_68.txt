Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm currently unable to create sequence diagrams. However, I can describe how the sequence diagram should look like:

1. The "Repository Manager" interacts with a "Collection/Object Management System".
2. The interaction begins with the "Repository Manager" sending a request to get the current language status. You can name this action as "View Current Languages".
3. The "Collection/Object Management System" processes this Request and interacts with a "Database or Storage System" to retrieve the necessary information.
4. "Collection/Object Management System" sends a request "Retrieve Languages".
5. The "Database or Storage System" processes this request and fetches the data, sending it back to the "Collection/Object Management System" in a message named something like "Languages Data".
6. "Collection/Object Management System" then communicates back to the "Repository Manager", updating them on the current languages used in a message like "Show Current Languages".

For any changes made to the indicated languages:

7. "Repository Manager" sends a request named "Update Languages" to the "Collection/Object Management System".
8. "Collection/Object Management System" interacts with "Database or Storage System" to update the language. It can send a message like "Update Language Data".
9. Upon successful update, "Database or Storage System" notify the "Collection/Object Management System" through a message like "Update Successful".
10. The "Collection/Object Management System" communicates this information back to the "Repository Manager" in a message like "Languages Updated Successfully".

It's important to note that the names and number of interactions may change depending on the actual system's structure and requirements.

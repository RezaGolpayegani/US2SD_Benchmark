It's not possible to provide a sequence diagram in a text-based format, but I can describe how to generate it in PlantUML.

1. **Site Admin interacts with Web UI**: 
``` 
SiteAdmin -> WebUI : Access Help Wanted Ads 
```

2. **Web UI sends request to the Back-end server**: 
``` 
WebUI -> BackEndServer : Request to display ads 
```

3. **Back-end server retrieves ads from the database**:
``` 
BackEndServer -> DataBase : Extract all ads 
DataBase -> BackEndServer : Respond with ads 
```

4. **Ads shown to the Site Admin**:
``` 
BackEndServer -> WebUI : Display ads 
```

5. **Site Admin selects an ad for editing or deletion**:
``` 
SiteAdmin -> WebUI : Select ad for Edit/Delete 
```

6. **Web UI sends a request to the back-end server**:
``` 
WebUI -> BackEndServer : Request to Edit/Delete ad 
```

7. **Back-end server processes the request and sends request to the database**:

For an editing action...
```
BackEndServer -> DataBase : Edit ad details 
DataBase -> BackEndServer : Confirm ad edited 
```
For a deletion action...
``` 
BackEndServer -> DataBase : Delete ad 
DataBase -> BackEndServer : Confirm ad deleted 
```

8. **Result displayed to the Site Admin**:
``` 
BackEndServer -> WebUI : Display result 
```
Site Admin then sees the result of either the edited ad or the deletion of the ad.

You should place the components of this sequence diagram in your PlantUML editor to get a graphical representation. Don't forget to enclose the code within "@startuml" and "@enduml" notation for proper recognition by PlantUML.

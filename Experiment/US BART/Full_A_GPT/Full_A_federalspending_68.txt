As an AI, I am unable to actually create images or diagrams. However, I can certainly write out a rough pseudo-code representation of what this sequence diagram might look like in PlantUML plain text format.

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor FABS_User

FABS_User -> FABS_System: Submit Data
alt Successful Submission
    FABS_System -> FABS_User: Confirmation Message
else Submission Errors
    FABS_System -> ErrorHandlingSystem: Forward Error Details
    ErrorHandlingSystem -> ErrorHandlingSystem: Match FABS Errors
    ErrorHandlingSystem -> FABS_System: Return Accurate Error Description
    FABS_System -> FABS_User: Display Accurate Error Message
end
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The FABS User initiates a data submission to the FABS System.
2. If the submission is successful, the FABS System returns a confirmation message to the FABS User.
3. If there are submission errors, the FABS System forwards the error details to the ErrorHandlingSystem.
4. The ErrorHandlingSystem matches the received errors with the predefined FABS errors to determine the appropriate error messages.
5. The ErrorHandlingSystem returns the accurate error descriptions back to the FABS System.
6. The FABS System then displays the accurate error messages to the FABS User. The user can then understand why their submission didn't work.

You can modify this sequence diagram as per your specific use case and constraints.

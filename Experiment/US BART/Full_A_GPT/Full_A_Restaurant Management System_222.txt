I, as an AI model, can't draw diagrams. However, I can provide you with the description of the sequence diagram in PlantUML.

Here is a solution:
```
@startuml
title 'Customer Order Report Sequence Diagram'

actor Manager as m

entity "Restaurant Management System" as rms
database "Customer Order Database" as cod

m -> rms : Request for customer order report
activate rms
rms -> cod : Fetch order data
activate cod
cod -->> rms : Return order data
deactivate cod
rms -->> m : Send order report
deactivate rms

@enduml
```

This is an example of a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML. Meanwhile, within the sequence diagram, the exchange of messages between the objects is as follows:

1. The manager exists in the system and should send a signal to the system indicating that they want to check the customer order reports.
2. The Restaurant Management System (rms) server gets the request. The system is interfaced with and it fetches all the order data that is necessary.
3. The "Customer Order Database" (cod) which stores all the information regarding to customer orders, receives the request from the Restaurant Management System (rms) to fetch the necessary order data. After getting the request from the system, the database retrieves all the needed information and return it back to the system.
4. The system processes all the retrieved data and once it has the necessary report, it will return them to the manager who made the request initially.
   
It should be noted that this is a simple representation of what the sequence diagram should look like based on the provided user story. It can be expanded and get complex depending on the level of detail required.

Here is a step-by-step representation of the necessary PlantUML sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
actor Manager
entity Waiter
database OrderHistory

Manager -> Waiter : collect order data
Waiter -> OrderHistory : access order data
OrderHistory --> Waiter : send order data
Waiter --> Manager : deliver order data
@enduml
```

According to the above sequence diagram, the process starts with the manager requesting the order data from the waiters. The waiters then access the order data from the OrderHistory database. The OrderHistory database sends the order data back to the waiters. Finally, the waiter delivers the order data to the manager. 

However, it's worth noting that a sequence diagram is generally used to depict the sequence of actions that happen in a system. But the user story you have given constitutes a single action or request (that is 'see the number of orders taken by each waiter') from the viewpoint of the manager. 

Please ensure that you have appropriate software that supports PlantUML to correctly visualize this script!

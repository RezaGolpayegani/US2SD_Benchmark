Since I'm unable to create diagrams as a text-based AI, I'll write out the sequence diagram in Plant UML text-based language for your user story. You can run this code on any Plant UML editor to get your sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant Database
participant ExpiredBooks
participant Notification

Librarian -> Database : Query Expired Books
activate Database
Database --> Librarian : Return Expired Books  
deactivate Database
create ExpiredBooks
Librarian -> ExpiredBooks : Create()  
activate ExpiredBooks
Librarian --> ExpiredBooks : Display Expired Books  
deactivate ExpiredBooks
Librarian -> Notification : Prepare Notifications for expired books  
activate Notification
Notification --> Librarian : Sends Notifications  
deactivate Notification
@enduml
```

Here the librarian queries the database for expired books. The system then stores the list of expired books and displays them. The librarian then prepares a notification for each of the expired books, which the system automatically sends out. 

Please run this code in your Plant UML editor to see the Diagram.

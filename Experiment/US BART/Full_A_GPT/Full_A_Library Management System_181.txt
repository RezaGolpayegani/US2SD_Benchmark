Here is a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the User Story:

```
@startuml
actor Member
box "Library Management System" 
participant "Search for book Module" as A
participant "Sorting & Filtering Module" as B
end box

Member -> A: Search for book 
A -> A: Process the search
activate A
A--> A: Retrieves books list
deactivate A
A--> Member: Returns unsorted book results.

Member-> B: Sorts & filters book results
B-> B: Applies sorting by title, author etc.
activate B
B-> B: Filters books based on genre, publication etc.
B-->B:Final sorted and filtered books list
deactivate B
B-->Member: Returns sorted & filtered book results
@enduml
```

The actor 'Member' initiates the sequence by searching for a book through 'Search for book Module'. This module processes the search and retrieves a list of books. However, these initial results are not sorted or filtered.

The 'Member' then sends these results to 'Sorting & Filtering Module'. This module sorts the books (e.g., by title, author), filters them (e.g., by genre, publication), and generates a final sorted and filtered list.

At the end of the sequence, the 'Member' receives the sorted and filtered book results.

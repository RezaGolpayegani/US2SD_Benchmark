Due to the limitations of this AI, itâ€™s unable to generate diagrams or code directly. However, I can describe to you how the sequence diagram would look in Plant UML format.

The sequence diagram will have the following sequence:

1. DigitalRecords Archivist (DRA) initiates the batch ingest of ETDs.

2. The system validates the DRA's permissions.

3. The system responds with confirmation if the DRA has the required permissions or with an unauthorized error if not. 

4. Once the DRA's permissions are validated and confirmed, the DRA can specify the deposit groups and people. 

5. The DRA will then set a date for the deposit window to close.

6. The system will confirm these actions.

Here is a rough text description of how this would look in PlantUML:

@startuml
DRA -> System : initiate batch ingest of ETDs
System -> System : validate DRA permissions
System --> DRA : confirm valid permissions
DRA -> System : specify deposit groups and people
DRA -> System : set deposit window close date
System --> DRA : confirm actions 
@enduml

This is a basic schema, you may need to tweak few elements based on your actual implementation.

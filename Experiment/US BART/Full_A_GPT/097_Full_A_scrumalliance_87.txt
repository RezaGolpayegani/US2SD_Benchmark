Creating a sequence diagram using Plant UML for the user story would not be feasible without knowing the exact steps and entities involved. Given that, here is a theoretical example:

```PlantUML
@startuml

title Edit Content of Automatic Email

actor Editor
entity "Email Management System" as EMS
database "Email Template DB" as DB

Editor -> EMS : Request to Edit Email(templateID)
activate EMS
EMS -> DB : Fetch Email Template(templateID)
activate DB
DB -->> EMS : Return Email Template
deactivate DB
EMS -->> Editor : Display Email Template(text)
deactivate EMS
Editor -> EMS : Send Edited Template(text, templateID)
activate EMS
EMS -> DB : Update Email Template(text, templateID)
activate DB
DB -->> EMS : Confirm Update
deactivate DB
EMS -->> Editor : Confirm Update Success
deactivate EMS

This example assumes the occurrence of steps such as fetching, displaying, and updating the email template from the database, acknowledging the update, and the Editor edits the template.

The variables 'templateID' and 'text' is used to denote the unique identifier of the email template and the email text. However, please adapt these steps to your actual project's requirements and system architecture.

This example also assumes that the Editor is allowed to send the edited template directly without need for a validation or approval process. But, these aspects may need to be considered in real-world scenarios.

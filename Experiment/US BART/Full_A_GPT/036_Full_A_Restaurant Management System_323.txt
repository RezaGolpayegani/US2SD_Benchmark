As a language model AI, I don't have the ability to generate visual diagrams. However, I can write a textual description of how the sequence diagram might be conceived in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Add Store Order

actor Employee
entity "Store Order System" as system
database "Orders DB" as db

Employee -> system : addStoreOrder()
activate system

system -> db : addOrder(orderDetails)
activate db

db --> system : confirmation
deactivate db

system --> Employee : displayConfirmation(confirmation)
deactivate system

@enduml
```

Here's what the above plant UML code represents:

1. The sequence starts with the Employee initiating an action to add a store order with `addStoreOrder()`. 
2. This action activates the "Store Order System". 
3. The Store Order System then sends an `addOrder(orderDetails)` message to the "Orders DB" which is represented as a database in this context. 
4. After the order database receives this message, it gets activated to add the new order.
5. Once the order is added successfully, the database sends a `confirmation` message back to the Store Order System and its task (adding order) gets deactivated (signified by the keyword `deactivate`).
6. Afterwards, the system displays the received `confirmation` to the Employee.
7. Once the order is successfully added, the system task (adding store order) gets deactivated.

Kindly note that this scenario assumes the situations where all operations are successful. Variations would exist for scenarios relating to failed attempts.

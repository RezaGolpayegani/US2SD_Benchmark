As a language model AI,M I donâ€™t have support to visual infrastructures meaning, I don't have the ability to create diagrams; but I can help you write the Plant UML sequence diagram code for your user story.

```
@startuml
title Normalise Measures by GINI and Related Socioeconomic Indexes

actor API_User as "API User"
component Data as "Published Dataset"
component Normaliser as "GINI & Socioeconomic Indexes Normaliser"
database DB as "Database"

API_User -> Data : Request Data
Data -> Data : Validate Request
Data -> DB : Fetch Dataset
DB --> Data : Return Dataset
Data --> API_User: Return Requested Dataset

API_User -> Normaliser : Request Normalisation
activate Normaliser

Normaliser -> Normaliser : Generate Socioeconomic Indexes
Normaliser -> DB : Fetch GINI values
DB --> Normaliser : Return GINI values

Normaliser -> Normaliser : Normalise measures
Normaliser --> API_User : Return Normalised Data

deactivate Normaliser

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the API user first requests a dataset, which is fetched from the database and provided to the user. The API user then requests data normalization through GINI and related socioeconomic indexes. The normalizer generates these indexes, fetches the necessary GINI values from the database, normalizes the measures according to these values and returns the normalized data.

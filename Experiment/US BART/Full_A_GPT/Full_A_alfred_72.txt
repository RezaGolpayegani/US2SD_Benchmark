Based on the given user story, this is an example of how a Plant UML sequence diagram could look for an older person using ALFRED to learn about art expositions or a museum:

```plantuml
@startuml
hide footbox

actor OlderPerson as op
entity ALFRED as alf
database MuseumDatabase as mdb

op -> alf : RequestInformation(ArtExposition)
activate alf

alf -> mdb : GetArtExpositionList()
activate mdb

mdb --> alf : ReturnArtExpositionList()
deactivate mdb

alf --> op : ShowArtExpositionList()
deactivate alf

op -> alf : InterestedInDetails(ArtExhibition)
activate alf

alf -> mdb : GetArtExpositionDetails(ArtExhibition)
activate mdb

mdb --> alf : ReturnArtExpositionDetails()
deactivate mdb

alf --> op : ShowArtExpositionDetails()
deactivate alf

@enduml
``` 

This plantuml sequence diagram covers the process of an older person requesting information about art expositions from ALFRED, and ALFRED providing the details sequentially. 

The 'actor' represents the older person, the 'entity' is ALFRED, and the 'database' represents a hypothetical database where all the details about art expositions are stored. 

The 'activate' and 'deactivate' lines represent the start and the end of the interaction between the actors. This diagram assumes that ALFRED can access a dedicated art exposition database and perform operations such as GetArtExpositionList() and GetArtExpositionDetails(). 

Please note that the effectiveness of this sequence diagram largely depends on the exact functionalities provided by ALFRED.

This sequence is made in a simplified manner and it doesn't depict other potential functionalities that ALFRED might have, neither it covers potential errors or exceptions to the process, which should be added according to the exact requirements of your software project.

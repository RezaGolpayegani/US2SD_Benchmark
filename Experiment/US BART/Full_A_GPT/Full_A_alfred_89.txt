This is an example of how the sequence diagram might look using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
title OlderPerson Interaction with ALFRED Shirt Purchase

participant "OlderPerson" as OP
database "ALFRED Data" as AD
participant "ALFRED System" as AS

OP -> AS : Request ALFRED Shirt
AS -> AD : Fetch ALFRED Shirt Details
AD --> AS : Return Shirt Details
AS --> OP : Display ALFRED Shirt Details

note right: OlderPerson understands ALFRED shirt is non-stigmatizing.

OP -> AS : Confirm Purchase
AS -> AD : Process Purchase
AD --> AS : Confirmation
AS --> OP : Confirm Purchase
```

Here's what the sequence diagram tells us:

1. An OlderPerson makes a request for an ALFRED Shirt.
2. The ALFRED System fetches the details of the ALFRED Shirt from the associated data source.
3. The data about the ALFRED Shirt is returned to the ALFRED System from the Data source.
4. The ALFRED System displays the fetched details to the OlderPerson.
5. The OlderPerson gets to know that the ALFRED shirt is non-stigmatizing from the displayed details.
6. The OlderPerson confirms the purchase.
7. The ALFRED System processes the purchase request.
8. The transaction confirmation is sent by the AD (ALFRED Data) source to the ALFRED System.
9. Finally, the ALFRED System confirms the successful purchase to the OlderPerson.

Please adjust as needed based on the specificities of the ALFRED system.

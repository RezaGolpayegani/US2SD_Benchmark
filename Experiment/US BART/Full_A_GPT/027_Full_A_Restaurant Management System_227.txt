Based on your requirements, here is a simple sequence diagram code sequence in Plant UML format:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Employee 
entity "Order Management System" as OMS
database "Order Database" as ODB

Employee -> OMS: Request to see active orders in order 
OMS -> ODB: Get all active orders 
ODB --> OMS: Return all active orders 
OMS --> Employee : Display all active orders in order by start date 

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram represents the interaction between the restaurant employee, the Order Management System (OMS), and the Order Database (ODB).

The sequence is as follows:

1. The restaurant employee requests to see all the active orders in order.
2. The Order Management System receives this request and asks the Order Database to retrieve all active orders.
3. The Order Database returns all the active orders to the Order Management System.
4. The Order Management System then displays all the active orders in order by the start date to the restaurant employee.

Please copy above code to a PlantUML editor to visualize the diagram. Due to the restrictions of this platform, we are unable to provide an on-stage rendering of the UML diagram.

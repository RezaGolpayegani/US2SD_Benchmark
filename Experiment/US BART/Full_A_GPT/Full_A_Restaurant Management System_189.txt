To generate a Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the User Story: "As a manager, I want to see the customer satisfaction ratio", we need to identify the different actors involved and the interactions between them. For this user story, some important actors may include: Manager, System, Customer Satisfaction Ratio Module, Survey Results module and Database.

Given this, here's a possible Sequence Diagram expressed in PlantUML code:

```
@startuml
actor Manager
entity "System: Restaurant Management" as System
database "Database" as DB
entity "Customer Satisfaction Ratio Module" as CSR_Module
entity "Survey Results Module" as Survey_Results

Manager -> System : Requests Customer Satisfaction Ratio
activate System

System -> CSR_Module : Triggers Customer Satisfaction Ratio Calculation
activate CSR_Module

CSR_Module -> Survey_Results : Fetches Survey Results
activate Survey_Results

Survey_Results -> DB : Pulls Survey Data
activate DB

DB --> Survey_Results : Returns Survey Data
deactivate DB

Survey_Results --> CSR_Module : Returns Parsed Survey Data
deactivate Survey_Results

CSR_Module --> System : Returns Calculated Satisfaction Ratio
deactivate CSR_Module

System --> Manager : Displays Customer Satisfaction Ratio
deactivate System
@enduml
```
This script will generate a sequence diagram where the Manager interacts with the Restaurant System to fetch the Customer Satisfaction Ratio. Then, the system triggers a Customer satisfaction calculation within a Module. The module gathers data from the Survey Results, interacts with the Database to fetch data, calculates the ratio, and returns it back to the Manager through the system.

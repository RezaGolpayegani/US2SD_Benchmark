Since it's impossible to create diagrams within the text-only capabilities of this AI model, I'm providing you with a sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on your user story. You can use an online editor or a supported development environment to visualize this sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
entity "Researcher Interface" as UI
database "Archival Database" as DB

Researcher -> UI : Request Crossâˆ’Collection Citation
activate UI

UI -> DB : Retrieve Citation Information
activate DB

DB -->> UI : Return Citation Information
deactivate DB

UI -->> Researcher : Display Citation
deactivate UI
@enduml
```

This sequence explains the actions taken when a researcher requests for cross-collection citation from a system.

1. The researcher makes a request for cross-collection citation.
2. The system's researcher interface processes the request and sends it to the archival database.
3. The archival database retrieves the required citation information.
4. The retrieved citation information is sent back to the researcher interface.
5. The researcher interface then displays the citation to the researcher.

Remember, you must use a PlantUML engine to generate a visual diagram using this provided code.

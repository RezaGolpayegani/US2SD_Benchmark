As an AI, I'm unable to draw diagrams, but I can certainly provide a text-based sequence diagram in PlantUML format that corresponds to the user story you provided:

```plaintext
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "System" as S
participant "Collection" as C
participant "Object" as O

RM -> S: Request(name, role)
activate S
S -> C: Find(name)
activate C
C -> C: Check(role)
activate C
C --> S: Return(collectionWithRole)
deactivate C
S --> RM: Display(collectionWithRole)
deactivate S
@enduml
```

Here is a simple explanation of the sequence diagram:

1. The "Repository Manager" requests to assign a specific role to the name related to a collection or object from the "System".

2. The "System" then checks the "Collection" if such a name exists.

3. If the name exists, the "Collection" assigns the specific role to the name.

4. The "Collection" returns the object or collection with the updated role back to the "System".

5. The "System" then displays the updated collection or object to the "Repository Manager".

Please note: This is a very simple sequence diagram and sometime might need adjustments according to the specific use case and the system's details on how it will handle such requests.

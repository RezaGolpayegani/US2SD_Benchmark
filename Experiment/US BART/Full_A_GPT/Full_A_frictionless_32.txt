Based on the project description, you request for a PlantUML sequence diagram. But due to the constraints of the text-only format, I can describe how you might create a PlantUML sequence diagram for your user story.

However, please note that the generated PlantUML code is text-based (it's like a programming language for diagrams), so you will have to use a PlantUML viewer/compiler to transform it into a visualization (diagram).

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Developer
participant "Data Packager" as DP
participant "DSpace Integration" as DI
database DSpace

Developer -> DP : Request(Data Package)
activate DP
DP --> Developer: Return(Data Package)
deactivate DP

Developer -> DI: Initiate Integration(Data Package)
activate DI
DI -> DSpace: Send(Data Package)
activate DSpace
DSpace --> DI: Confirmation(Integration Successful)
deactivate DSpace

DI --> Developer: Confirmation(Integration Successful)
deactivate DI

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram represents the following steps:

1. The developer requests a data package from the Data Packager service.
2. The Data Packager service returns the data package to the developer.
3. The developer then initiates integration with the DSpace service, sending the data package received before.
4. The DSpace service confirms the successful integration.
5. The DSpace Integration service confirms the successful integration to the developer.

You can adjust it as per your real workflow and needs in terms of participants, interaction, returned values, etc.

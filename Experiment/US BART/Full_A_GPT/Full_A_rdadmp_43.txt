Unfortunately I am not able to generate diagrams. However, I'll try my best to describe it in steps.

Here is a proposed sequence diagram in PlantUML format to describe the user story:

```
@startuml
actor Repository_Manager
entity System
database Repository

Repository_Manager -> System : Request data details
System -> Repository : Retrieve data details
Repository --> System : Return data details  
System --> Repository_Manager : Show details  
@enduml  
```

Let's explain this sequence diagram.

1. The Repository Manager requests details on the type of data from the System.

2. The System retrieves these details from the Repository.

3. The Repository returns the details to the System.

4. The System displays these details to the Repository Manager.

The purpose of this sequence diagram is to show the interactions among the Repository Manager, the System, and the Repository in terms of an ordered sequence of events. 

Please note that,'--> ' and ' -> ' in PlantUML have difference in their timings. '->' represents synchronous messages. It means sender sends a message and waits for the receiver to process the message. '-->' on the other hand, represents asynchronous messages. It means sender doesn't wait for the receiver to process the message.

Also this is a text description of the interactions. If you want to convert this text description to an actual UML sequence diagram you can use any UML diagram drawing tool supports PlantUML syntax, for example PlantText, PlantUML Online Editor etc. Just paste this description into the editor and the tool will create an actual diagram out of it.

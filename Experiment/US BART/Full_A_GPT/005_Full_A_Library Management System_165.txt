Here is the PlantUML format sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to order books according to title":

```
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as LM
participant "Library System" as LS
participant "Database" as DB

LM -> LS : Enter book title
activate LS
LS -> DB : Search book by title
activate DB
DB --> LS : Return search result
deactivate DB
LS --> LM : Display search result
deactivate LS

LM -> LS : Submit order for book
activate LS
LS -> DB : Order book by title
activate DB
DB --> LS : Confirm order
deactivate DB
LS --> LM : Confirm order
deactivate LS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the library member entering a book title. The library system then searches for the book in the database and returns the search results to the library system, which then displays the results to the library member. The library member can then order the book through the library system, which sends an order request to the database. The database confirms the order with the library system, which in turn confirms the order with the library member.

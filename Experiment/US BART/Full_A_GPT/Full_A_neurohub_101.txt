Apologies as generating a detailed sequence diagram on this platform is actually difficult due to the lack of support for visual diagrams. However, a sequence diagram can typically be created in a text-based format using Plant UML. Below is a sample text-based Plant UML sequence diagram in format for the story: 

As a researcher, I want to have a group-level repository for sharing papers/reviews/comments with other researchers.

```plantuml
@startuml
'Replace participant name and title as needed
actor Researcher
participant RepositoryInterface
participant RepositoryDatabase

Researcher -> RepositoryInterface: Request Access to Repository
RepositoryInterface -> RepositoryDatabase: Validate Researcher Access
RepositoryDatabase --> RepositoryInterface: Grant Access

group Upload Document
    Researcher -> RepositoryInterface: Upload Document
    RepositoryInterface -> RepositoryDatabase: Save Document in Database
    RepositoryDatabase --> RepositoryInterface: Confirm Upload
    RepositoryInterface --> Researcher: Notify Document Uploaded
end

group Download Document
    Researcher -> RepositoryInterface: Request Document
    RepositoryInterface -> RepositoryDatabase: Fetch Document
    RepositoryDatabase --> RepositoryInterface: Send Document
    RepositoryInterface --> Researcher: Show Document
end

group Share Comment
    Researcher -> RepositoryInterface: Post Comment
    RepositoryInterface -> RepositoryDatabase: Save Comment in Database related to document
    RepositoryDatabase --> RepositoryInterface: Confirm Comment added
    RepositoryInterface --> Researcher: Notify Comment Posted
end

The above diagram shows researcher interacting with a repository by firstly requesting access to the repository. Once access is granted the researcher can upload documents, download documents, and share comments on shared documents. This flow is maintained by a RepositoryInterface and RepositoryDatabase that validate, save, fetch, and confirm data inputs/outputs. 

This script can be copied into a Plant UML supporting editor to generate the actual UML Sequence Diagram. Note that this is a simplified diagram and you might want to add more details like error handling and specific document operations as needed.

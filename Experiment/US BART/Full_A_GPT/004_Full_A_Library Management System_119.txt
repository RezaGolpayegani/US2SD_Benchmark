I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and I'm unable to create diagrams or images directly in my responses. However, I can guide you through generating a PlantUML sequence diagram based on the user story you provided: "As a library manager, I want to keep books and their checkouts". Here is a hypothetical sequence in text form:

1. The library manager selects a book to update its checkout status.
2. A request is sent to the book database.
3. The book database fetches the book details.
4. The book details are sent back to the library manager.
5. The library manager updates the book checkout status.
6. A request to update the status is sent to the book database.
7. The book database updates the book checkout status.
8. A confirmation message is sent to the library manager.

In PlantUML code it might look something like this:

```
@startuml
participant "Library Manager" as A
database "Book Database" as B

A -> B : Update book checkout status
activate B
B --> B : Fetch book details
B --> A : Send book details

Deactivate B
activate A
A -> B : Request to update status
activate B
B --> B : Update book checkout status
B --> A : Confirmation message
deactivate B
@enduml
```

Replace participant and database names as per your project's actual names.
Please, note that the above-mentioned code is a general way of representing it. You may need to modify it according to your specific project architecture and how the different components interact with each other.

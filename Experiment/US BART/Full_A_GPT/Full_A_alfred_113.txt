As an AI, I'm unable to draw complex diagrams but I can provide you with the needed code in PlantUML format to generate a sequence diagram. Here's a simple version based on your description. You may need to adjust it to better fit your exact needs in a UML diagram editor:

```
@startuml
' Define the actors

actor OlderPerson
entity "ALFRED Device" as ALFRED
database "Games Database" as GamesDB

' Start of the sequence

OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Request Games
ALFRED -> GamesDB : Fetch Opposing Motion Games

' Games DB fetches games and returns

GamesDB --> ALFRED : Return Games Data
ALFRED --> OlderPerson : Display Games

' Older person selects a game

OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Select a Game
ALFRED -> GamesDB : Fetch Game Details

' Games DB fetches game details and returns

GamesDB --> ALFRED : Return Game Details
ALFRED --> OlderPerson : Start Game
@enduml
```

This script depicts a process where an older person interacts with the ALFRED device to request games. ALFRED then communicates with a database to fetch "opposing motion games". The games data are returned and displayed to the older person, who then selects and starts a game.

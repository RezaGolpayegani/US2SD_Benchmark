I'm an AI model and cannot provide precise visuals or diagrams. However, I can present to you a textual or syntax description of how your sequence diagram would appear in PlantUML format. Here it goes:

```puml
@startuml
actor "Library Staff"
participant "System"
participant "Statistics"
participant "Repository"
participant "Collection"
participant "Author"
participant "Item"

"Library Staff" -> "System" : Login
"System" -> "Library Staff" : Authenticate User
alt Authentication successful
    "Library Staff" -> "System" : Request Usage Statistics
    "System" -> "Statistics" : Gather Usage Statistics
    "Statistics" -> "Repository" : Retrieve Repository Statistics
    "Repository" -> "Statistics" : Return Repository Data

    "Statistics" -> "Collection" : Retrieve Collection Statistics
    "Collection" -> "Statistics" : Return Collection Data

    "Statistics" -> "Author" : Retrieve Author Statistics
    "Author" -> "Statistics" : Return Author Data

    "Statistics" -> "Item" : Retrieve Item Statistics
    "Item" -> "Statistics" : Return Item Data

    "Statistics" -> "System" : Return Compiled Statistics
    "System" -> "Library Staff" : Display Statistics

else Authentication failed
    "System" -> "Library Staff" : Display Error Message
end

```

This sequence diagram represents the interactions between a library staff member and the system, as well as the underlying components (Repository, Collection, Author, Item). The overall flow of operations includes login, authentication, request for usage stats, and retrieval and display of statistical data. Please note that you need to replace "Statistics", "Repository", "Collection", "Author", and "Item" with the actual names of your system components.

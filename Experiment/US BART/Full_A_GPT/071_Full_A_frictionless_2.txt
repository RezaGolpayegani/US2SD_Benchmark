Here is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format for this user story:

```puml
@startuml
Researcher -> DataPackage: Request Data
DataPackage -> DataServer: Fetch Data
DataServer --> DataPackage: Send Data
DataPackage --> Researcher: Deliver Data Package
Researcher -> Julia: Load Data Package
Julia --> Researcher: Start Analysis and Visualizations
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a researcher, the data package and the Julia system. 

1. The researcher requests data from the data package. 
2. The data package then fetches the requested data from the data server. 
3. Once the data is fetched, the server sends it back to the data package. 
4. The data package then delivers this data package to the researcher. 
5. The researcher loads the data package into Julia. 
6. After the data package is loaded successfully, the researcher can start doing analysis and visualizations using Julia. 

Each of these steps takes place in sequence, hence it is a sequence diagram. Note that the arrows represent the direction of communication, and the dashed lines represent a response to a previous message.

Please note that the specifics of the diagram could vary based on the details and complexity of the technical requirements which have not been provided in this case.

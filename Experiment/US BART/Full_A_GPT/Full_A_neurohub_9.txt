The sequence diagram in Plant UML format would look something like this:

```
@startuml
title Create and Attach File to Log Book page Sequence

actor Researcher

participant "Web Browser" as WB
participant "Web Server" as WS
participant "Database" as DB

Researcher -> WB : Navigate to log book page creation
WB -> WS : Request page creation form
WS -> DB : Fetch template
DB --> WS : Return template
WS --> WB : Render creation form
Researcher -> WB : Fill out form and attach file
WB -> WS : Submit form
WS -> DB : Validate form and save data
DB --> WS : Acknowledge save successful
WS --> WB : Display success message
Researcher -> WB : View new log book page
WB -> WS : Request new log book page
WS -> DB : Fetch new log book page
DB --> WS : Return new log book page
WS --> WB : Render new log book page
Researcher <-- WB : Display new log book page

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process of the researcher creating a new log book page and attaching a file to it. From navigating to the log book creation form to viewing the newly created page, each interaction between the researcher, the Web Browser, the Web Server, and the Database is represented in the diagram.

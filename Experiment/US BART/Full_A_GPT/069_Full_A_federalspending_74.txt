Here's a simple sequence diagram example in PlantUML:

```plantuml
participant "Agency User" as A
participant "System" as S
participant "File F" as F

A -> S : Request File F
activate S
S --> F: Validate File Format
activate F
F -->> S: Format Confirmation
deactivate F
S -->> A: Deliver File F
deactivate S
```

This is a basic sequence which includes interactions between the agency user, the system, and File F. According to these interactions, the agency user requests File F from the system. The system then validates the format of File F. After receiving a confirmation from File F about the format, the system delivers File F to the agency user.

Please note that this is an overly simplified example. Depending upon the context and detailed requirements, your sequence diagram might need to include more participants and interactions.

I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I can't draw diagrams. However, I can provide you with a textual description on how can you structure your Plant UML sequence diagram based on user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
database "Inventory Management System" as IMS
participant "Database" as D

M -> IMS : Request remaining items 
activate IMS
IMS -> D : Fetch remaining items 
activate D
D -> D : Retrieve items data
D -> IMS : Return remaining items data. 
deactivate D
IMS --> M : Display remaining items. 
deactivate IMS
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The Manager sends a request to the Inventory Management System for the remaining items.
2. The system then sends this request to the Database.
3. The Database then retrieves the remaining items data and returns it to the System.
4. The System then displays the remaining items to the Manager.

Please note, the code could be changed according to the actual software design and system setup.

This is a written overview of the sequence diagram:

1. The Moderator starts a new game and the system responds by creating a new game instance.
2. The system generates a unique game URL and delivers it to the Moderator.
3. The Moderator invites Estimators by sharing the unique URL.
4. The Estimators access the game via the shared URL.
5. The system verifies the URL and if valid, gives the Estimators access to the game.
6. The game begins and the system communicates this to the Moderator and the Estimators.

Plant UML code for the sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
actor "Moderator" as mod
participant "Estimation Game System" as sys
actor Estimators

mod -> sys: Start new game
activate sys
sys -> sys: Create new game instance
sys --> mod: Generate and deliver unique game URL
deactivate sys

mod -> Estimators: Invite via URL

Estimators -> sys: Access game via URL
activate sys
sys -> sys: Validate URL

alt URL is valid
sys --> Estimators: Grant access to game
else URL is not valid
sys --> Estimators: Deny access to game with invalid URL message
end

sys --> mod: Game begins
sys --> Estimators: Game begins
deactivate sys
@enduml
```

This PlantUML code will generate a sequence diagram that represents the interactions between Moderator, Estimators, and the Estimation Game System.

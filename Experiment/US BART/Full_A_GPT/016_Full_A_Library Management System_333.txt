Since I can't draw diagrams here, I will instead describe the necessary elements that should be included in the sequence diagram you will be drawing. In PlantUML, a sequence diagram would generally start with the `@startuml` command, and end with the `@enduml` command.

Here's the entire description written down:

```
@startuml
participant Staff as "Staff"
participant Database as "Database"
participant Book as "Book"

activate Staff

Staff -> Database: SearchBookByTitle(title)
activate Database
Database -> Book: CheckExistence(title)
activate Book
Book --> Database: Result(exist or not)
deactivate Book
Database --> Staff: Result(exist or not)
deactivate Database

alt exist
    Staff -> Database: MakeReservation(bookID)
    activate Database
    Database -> Book: Reserve(bookID)
    activate Book
    Book --> Database: Result(success or fail)
    deactivate Book
    Database --> Staff: Result(success or fail)
    deactivate Database

    Staff -> Database: Checkout(bookID)
    activate Database
    Database -> Book: RemoveFromAvailableList(bookID)
    activate Book
    Book --> Database: Result (success or fail)
    deactivate Book
    Database --> Staff: Result (success or fail)
    deactivate Database
end

deactivate Staff

@enduml
```

Of course, the exact details of your sequence diagram may be adjusted according to the particulars of your software system and development method. However, the steps above should serve as a good starting point for creating the PlantUML diagram. 

Remember to replace `(title)` and `(bookID)` with actual titles and IDs according to your system when using this in real life situations.

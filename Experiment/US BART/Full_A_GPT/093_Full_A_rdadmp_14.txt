As an AI, I can provide textual representation of the sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax to help illustrate the given user story, but I don't have the ability to create visual diagrams directly. Here is the PlantUML syntax for the requested user story:

```
@startuml
participant "Data Librarian" as D
participant "DMP System" as DNS
participant "Other Systems" as OS
participant "Data Catalogue" as DC

D -> DNS : Request for pointers to metadata
activate DNS
DNS --> OS : Retrieve metadata pointers
activate OS
OS --> DNS : Return metadata pointers
deactivate OS
DNS --> D : Return metadata pointers
deactivate DNS
D -> DC : Import metadata pointers
activate DC
DC --> D : Confirm metadata import
deactivate DC
@enduml
```

This markdown script describes a sequence where:

1. The data librarian requests for pointers to metadata from DMP System.
2. The DMP System then retrieves these metadata pointers from the Other Systems.
3. Other Systems return metadata pointers back to the DMP System.
4. The DMP System then returns these metadata pointers to the data librarian.
5. The data librarian then imports these metadata pointers into the Data Catalogue.
6. The data catalogue confirms the import of metadata to the data librarian.

To visualize the sequence diagram, you can simply paste this PlantUML syntax into any PlantUML viewer or tool.

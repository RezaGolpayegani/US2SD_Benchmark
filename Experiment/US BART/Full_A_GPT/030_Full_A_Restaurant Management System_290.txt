Below is a simple sequence diagram example based on the given user story. Note that sequence diagrams are often designed uniquely depending on the specifics of the software system and the mechanics of-order processing. Here, we presume a simple flow where the waiter enters orders, the system captures and confirms the data:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Waiter
entity System
box "Order Management"
    participant "Order Entry Process"
end box

Waiter -> System : Enter Order Details
activate System
System -> "Order Entry Process" : Capture Order 
activate "Order Entry Process"
"Order Entry Process" -> System : Confirm order
System --> Waiter : Order Confirmation
deactivate "Order Entry Process"
deactivate System
@enduml
```
The diagram described above is straightforward and introduces several standard elements of UML:

- `actor` represents the user of the system (in this case, the Waiter).
- `entity` is used to represent the complete System.
- A `box` can be used to include several participants to represent a subsystem (in this case, Order Management).
- `participant` is used to show multiple classes or entities (which could include backend processes, services, databases).
- The arrows (`-->) represent the flow of information.
The specific details of each interaction would vary depending on the details of the software.

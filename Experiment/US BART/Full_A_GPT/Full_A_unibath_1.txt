Creating a sequence diagram based on your project description in Plant UML format would look something like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Depositor Deposit Dataset Sequence

actor Depositor
boundary "Web Interface" as UI
control "Deposit Controller" as DC
entity "Dataset Repository" as DSR

Depositor -> UI: Login to web interface
UI -> DC: Authenticate depositor
note right
Successful login
Verifies the depositor authentication
end note

Depositor -> UI: Does deposit action
UI -> DC: Request to deposit dataset
note right
Deposit action includes:
- Select dataset file
- Enter dataset details
end note

DC -> DSR: Save dataset
DC <- DSR: Save acknowledgement

DC -> UI: Show deposit success
UI --> Depositor: Display deposit confirmation

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates a depositor's interaction with a web interface to deposit a dataset. The steps involve authentication, depositing action, and a success notification.

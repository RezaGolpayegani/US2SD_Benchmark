Here is your detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format:

```plantuml

Participant Manager
Participant "Inventory Management System (IMS)"
Participant Database

Manager -> "IMS" : Request missing book numbers
activate "IMS"

"IMS" -> Database : Retrieve missing book numbers
activate Database

Database -->> "IMS" : Return missing book numbers
deactivate Database

"IMS" -->> Manager : Display missing book numbers
deactivate "IMS"

This sequence diagram depicts the interaction for viewing missing book numbers. It involves three participants: the Manager, Inventory Management System, and Database. The process kicks off with the Manager sending a request to view missing book numbers to the IMS. The IMS then retrieves this data from the Database. Once the data is obtained, it is returned to the IMS, which then displays the missing book numbers to the Manager.

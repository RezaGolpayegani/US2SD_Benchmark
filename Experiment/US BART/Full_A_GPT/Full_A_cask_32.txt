As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, unfortunately at this moment, I can't actually generate images or diagrams directly. However, I can describe what the UML diagram would look like in Plant UML script format, based on the user story.

```
@startuml
actor "Plugin Developer"
boundary "Application"
database "Dataset"

"Plugin Developer" -> "Application" : Request to use custom dataset type
activate "Application"

"Application" -> "Dataset" : Checks for independent or app-deployed dataset
activate "Dataset"

note over "Dataset" : Dataset checks for requested type
"Dataset" --> "Application" : Returns results
deactivate "Dataset"

"Application" --> "Plugin Developer" : Provides access / error message based on result
deactivate "Application"
@enduml
```

This UML sequence describes the following:
- Plugin Developer requests to use the custom dataset type from the Application.
- The Application then checks the Dataset for the requested dataset type.
- The Dataset checks for the requested type and returns the result.
- Based on the result from the Dataset, the Application either provides access or shows an error message to the Plugin Developer. 

Please copy this script to your plantUML editor to visualize the diagram. 

Note: Please adjust according to your design details and constraints. As I infer the process based on your description and common software development practices, it might not fully represent your actual system design.

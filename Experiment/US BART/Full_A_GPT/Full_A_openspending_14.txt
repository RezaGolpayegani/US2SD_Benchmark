Generating sequence diagrams without visual cues can be difficult, but here's a basic textual representation of a sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml

title Provide Platform Admin with GeoJSON

actor "Data Publishing User" as DPUser
participant "System" as Sys
actor "Platform Administrator" as PAdmin

DPUser -> Sys: Provide GeoJSON sources
activate Sys

Sys -> DPUser : Confirm GeoJSON is valid
activate DPUser

DPUser -> Sys : Confirm validation
deactivate DPUser
Sys -> PAdmin : Notify about additional GeoJSON sources
activate PAdmin

PAdmin -> Sys : Accept additional GeoJSON sources
deactivate PAdmin
Sys -> DPUser : Confirm acceptance of GeoJSON

deactivate Sys

@enduml
```

You can copy this text and paste it into a PlantUML rendering tool like www.planttext.com to see the actual diagram. Here is what's happening:

1. Data Publishing User offers GeoJSON sources to the System.
2. The System confirms the provided GeoJSON is valid and sends a confirmation to the User.
3. User validates the message and confirms it.
4. System sends a notification to the Platform Administrator showing new GeoJSON sources.
5. Platform Administrator accepts the newly provided GeoJSON sources.
6. System confirms back to the Data Publishing User that the GeoJSON sources have been accepted.

To generate a sequence diagram for the provided user story, we need to identify the primary actors and understand the flow of interactions between them. Here's how you could represent it in PlantUML format:

Note: The `->` arrow indicates the direction of the communication/message and `..>` depicts a return message (response). 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "App Developer" as dev
participant "App Artifact" as artifact
participant "Dataset Type" as d_type
participant "Deployment Module" as d_module
participant "Error Handler" as e_handler

dev -> artifact : Include different version of Dataset Type
dev -> d_module : Deploy New Version of App
d_module -> d_type : Check Current Dataset Type
d_module <- d_type : Existing Dataset Type & Version
d_module -> d_module  : Compare Dataset Versions

alt Version Conflict
    d_module -> e_handler : Trigger Version Conflict Error
    e_handler ..> dev : Return Version Conflict Error   
else No Conflict 
    d_module -> d_type : Deploy Different Dataset Version
    e_handler ..> dev : Deployment Successful
end

@enduml
```

Note this diagram makes certain assumptions (for instance, that Dataset Types are able to verify their own versions, that there are defined modules to handle deployment and error handling, etc.). You would need to adjust the diagram to match the actual architecture of your system.

Also, this example ignores the detail of shared dataset instances between apps. That would add complexity to the diagram that may not be necessary for understanding the basic workflow, but could potentially be added if needed.

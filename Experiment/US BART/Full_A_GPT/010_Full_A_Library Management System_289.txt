Here is an example of detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format for this user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
title See Due Date

User->Membership: Login
alt Logged In
Membership-->User: Access Granted
User->Membership: Request User Details
Membership->LibraryDatabase: Fetch User Details
LibraryDatabase-->Membership: Return User Details
Membership-->User: Display User Details
User->LibraryDatabase: Search Borrowed Books
alt Found
LibraryDatabase-->User: Show Borrowed Books
User->LibraryDatabase: Request Due Dates
LibraryDatabase-->User: Display Due Dates
else Not Found
LibraryDatabase-->User: No Borrowed Books Found
end
else Access Denied
Membership-->User: Access Denied
end
@enduml
```
In this diagram, the main actor is the 'User' aka the member. User logs in to the Membership system. If the login is successful, the User requests for his details which is fetched from the 'LibraryDatabase'. Then the User searches for Borrowed Books from the LibraryDatabase which returns all the borrowed books. Then the User requests the due dates of each book, which is displayed by the LibraryDatabase.

If in any case the User is not found or borrowed books are not found, the respective message is shown to the User. If the login fails, the access is denied.

This sequence diagram lays out the possible sequence of interactions between the User, Membership system and LibraryDatabase in the process of retrieving borrowed books and their due dates.

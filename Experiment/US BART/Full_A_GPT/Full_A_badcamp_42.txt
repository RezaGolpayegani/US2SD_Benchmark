Here is a sequence diagram outline in PlantUML syntax for the given user story. Developers would add further implementation details to execute this sequence diagram:

```plaintext
@startuml
actor SummitCoordinator as S
entity SummitSite as SS
database SummitInfoDB as DB

S -> SS: Log in to summit site
SS --> S: Show Summit Coordinator Dashboard
S -> SS: Requests add/update summit information interface

SS --> S: Show add/update summit information form
S -> SS: Fill in basic information: Summit name, date, time, theme, reason to attend
SS -> DB: Save summit information

DB --> SS: Confirm summit information was saved
SS --> S: Indicate confirmation of information save
@enduml
```
This describes a sequence where the summit coordinator logs into the summit site, the site shows the summit coordinator dashboard, the coordinator requests to add or update the basic summit information, the site shows the form to enter this information, the coordinator fills out the form, and the new or updated information is saved to the database and a confirmation is shown.

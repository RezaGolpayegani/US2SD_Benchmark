As an AI language model, I can't draw diagrams, but I can give you an example in text form, of how the PlantUML code of such sequence diagram could be created.

```PlantUML
@startuml
title OlderPerson uses ALFRED to Detect Falls & Send Emergency

actor OlderPerson as OP
entity ALFRED as A
database PersonalData as PD
actor SpecificContact as SC
 
OP -> A : Activates fall detection
A -> PD : Access personal data
PD -> A : Returns contact information
A -> SC : Sends emergency alert
SC -> OP : Responds to emergency
A -> OP : Acknowledge response 

@enduml
```
In this diagram, the OlderPerson (OP) interacts with ALFRED (A). When the OlderPerson activates the fall detection, ALFRED accesses the personal data from the database (PD) and retrieves the specific contact information. Then, ALFRED sends an emergency alert to the SpecificContact (SC). After responding to the emergency, an acknowledgement is sent to the OlderPerson.

This is a simplified example and might not represent the real programming structure of your project, but you can modify this example based on your needs.

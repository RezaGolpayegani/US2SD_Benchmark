As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I lack the ability to create visual diagrams. However, I can provide the steps which can be used to create a Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format based on your User Story. It will involve actors such as Repository Manager and System. 

Below is a textual representation:

1. Repository Manager -> System: Opens Staff Interface
2. System -> Repository Manager: Display objects list
3. Repository Manager -> System: Select an object
4. System -> Repository Manager: Display available versions of selected object
5. Repository Manager -> System: Select version to restore
6. System -> Repository Manager: Confirm restore action
7. Repository Manager -> System: Confirms restore action
8. System -> Repository Manager: Restore selected version and display confirmation message

In terms of Plant UML format, this sequence could be represented similar to the following:

```
@startuml
actor RepositoryManager
entity System

RepositoryManager -> System : Opens Staff Interface
System --> RepositoryManager : Display objects list
RepositoryManager -> System : Select an object
System --> RepositoryManager : Display available versions of selected object
RepositoryManager -> System : Select version to restore
System -->RepositoryManager : Confirm restore action
RepositoryManager -> System: Confirms restore action
System --> RepositoryManager: Restore selected version and display confirmation message
@enduml
```

Please note that the above mentioned Plant UML format can be converted into a visual diagram using a Plant UML compiler. You may need to tweak this according to your exact system and requirements.

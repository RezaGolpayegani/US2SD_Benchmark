Since I cannot draw diagrams here, I'll describe how to generate a sequence diagram in text for your User Story in PlantUML format. 

Please replace the `<` & `>` characters accordingly as this editor might format them.

```
@startuml
actor Member
entity System 
database ReservationDB

Member -> System : Update Online Reservation
activate System
System -> ReservationDB : Fetch Reservation Details
activate ReservationDB
ReservationDB -->> System : Reservation Data
deactivate ReservationDB
System -->> Member : Display Reservation Details
Member -> System : Modify Reservation Details
System -> ReservationDB : Update Reservation Details
ReservationDB -->> System : Reservation Update Confirmation
System -->> Member : Display Update Confirmation
deactivate System
@enduml
```

In the above sequence diagram, 

- Member (you) sends a request to the System (application) to Update the Online Reservation.
- The System then sends the request to the database (ReservationDB) to fetch the reservation details.
- The database responds back to the System with the requested Reservation Data.
- The System then shows the Reservation Details to the Member.
- After viewing, the Member sends to System the modifications he/she wants to make in the reservation.
- The System then sends the updated Reservation Details to the database.
- The database then sends back a confirmation of the update.
- Finally, the System displays the Update Confirmation to the Member. 

If you are using any specific design tool, make sure to draw accordingly maintaining the interaction order.

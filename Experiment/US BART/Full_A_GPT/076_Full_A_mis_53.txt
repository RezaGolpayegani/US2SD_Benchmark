Unfortunately, it's not possible to provide a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML through this platform as it does not support graphical data or diagram generation capabilities needed to generate UML diagrams. However, I can draft a general sequence of steps that you can use to create a sequence diagram in Plant UML.

Below is how the UML syntax can look:

```PlantUML
@startuml
title Data Contributor, Disaster Recovery Plan Reference

participant DataContributor
participant DisasterRecoveryPlan
participant GrantProposal
participant DataManager

DataContributor -> GrantProposal: Start writing grant proposal
DataContributor -> DisasterRecoveryPlan: refer disaster recovery plan
DisasterRecoveryPlan --> DataContributor: provide disaster recovery plan

DataContributor -> DataManager: Data management plan needed
DataManager -> DisasterRecoveryPlan: incorporate disaster recovery plan
DisasterRecoveryPlan --> DataManager: provide disaster recovery plan

DataManager --> DataContributor: give completed data management plan
DataContributor -> GrantProposal: submit data management plan to grant proposal
GrantProposal --> DataContributor: confirm grant proposal completion

```
Please note that this Sequence Diagram is drafted based on generic understanding. Please modify it as per the actual interaction in your application domain and user role permissions.

These interactions are how the data contributor sources the disaster recovery plan, adds it to the grant proposal and data management plan with the DataManager coordinating incorporation into the Data Management plan and GrantProposal confirming completion.

Sure, below is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Consumer
entity PublisherProfilePage
database PublisherDB
Consumer->PublisherProfilePage: Request to view publisher's profile
PublisherProfilePage->PublisherDB: Fetch publisher's profile
PublisherDB->PublisherProfilePage: Return publisher's profile data
PublisherProfilePage->Consumer: Display publisher's profile
@enduml
```

This diagram represents following sequence of events:
1. The Consumer requests to view the publisher's profile.
2. The PublisherProfilePage is triggered and fetches the requested information from the PublisherDB.
3. The PublisherDB returns the requested profile data to the PublisherProfilePage.
4. Finally, the PublisherProfilePage displays the publisher's profile to the Consumer.

This is a basic representation and it can be extended as per interaction and system complexity.

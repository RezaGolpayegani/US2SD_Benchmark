Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to draw diagrams; however, I can provide you with textual PlantUML code which will generate a sequence diagram assuming that a Repository Manager interacts with a Database where all events related to an object's life cycle are held:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
database "DAMS Database" as DB

RM -> DB: Request events for specific object
note right: RM provides object's ID
activate DB
DB-->DB: Retrieves object's events
DB->RM: Returns object's events
note right: Events are listed in chronological order
deactivate DB
@enduml
```

To visualize this diagram, you should use an online PlantUML editor or installed software that supports Plant UML format. The diagram shows a repository manager requesting events associated with a particular object from the DAMS database, which then responds with the requested information.

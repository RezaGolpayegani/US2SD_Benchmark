Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram structure for the user story "As a librarian, I want to update pages for book information". 

Please note, adjustments may be necessary based on the specific functions and objects in your application, but this should provide a starting point.

```plantuml
@startuml
title "Update Book Information Pages"

actor "Librarian" as librarian 
box "Library System" 
participant "Authentication" as auth
participant "Database" as db
end box

librarian -> auth: validates_identity()
auth -> librarian: return validation_status
alt validation_status == success
librarian -> db: update_book_info_request()
db -> librarian: return update_response
else validation_status == failed
auth --> librarian: return error_message
end

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram begins with the librarian validating their identity in the system for security measures. The system returns a validation status. If the validation is successful, the librarian sends a request to the database to update the book's information. The database then returns a response about whether the update was successful or not. If the initial validation was not successful, the system returns an error message to the librarian.

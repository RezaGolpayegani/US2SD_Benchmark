Sure. Here is a simple Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the User Story: "As a manager, I want to see orders."

```
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "ManagementSystem" as MS
participant "OrderDatabase" as OD

M -> MS: Requests to see orders
activate MS
MS -> OD: Fetches orders
activate OD
OD --> MS: Returns order data
deactivate OD
MS --> M: Sends order data
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

This is a basic example. The sequence starts with the manager requesting to see orders from the management system. The management system then fetches these orders from the order database and returns this information to the manager. Note that more complex or specific behaviors would require a more detailed sequence diagram.

Remember, a sequence diagram mainly depicts interaction between objects in a sequential manner i.e., in the order the interactions take place. They're drawn from top down, time flows from top to bottom. Thus, the manager request is at the top since it's the first action, and responses return upwards when they're complete. 

Boxes (participant "Manager") represent entities, arrows (M -> MS) represent calls and interactions, while "activate" and "deactivate" represent the lifespan of a particular process. The messages are written above the arrows. 

Note: To view the diagram, you need to copy-paste this sequence into a PlantUML viewer/IDE or graphic tool that supports rendering of PlantUML sequences. 

Please refer to the PlantUML documentation or the tool's user manual for additional information on how to customize your diagram to suit your specific needs.

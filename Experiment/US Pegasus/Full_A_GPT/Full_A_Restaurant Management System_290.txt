Given the nature of PlantUML, I can't provide a graphical sequence diagram. However, I can provide the text used to generate a sequence diagram using the PlantUML language.

```
@startuml
title Waiter Order Detail Entry Sequence   

actor Waiter
participant "Order System" as OS
database "Order Database" as DB

Waiter -> OS : Enter Order Details
activate OS

OS -> DB : Submit Order Details
activate DB

DB --> OS : Confirm Order Submission
deactivate DB

OS --> Waiter : Show Order Submission Confirmation
deactivate OS

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- `Waiter` is the actor who initiates the sequence by entering order details into the `Order System`.
- `Order System` receives the order details from `Waiter` and submits these details to `Order Database`.
- `Order Database` confirms the submission of the order details back to `Order System`.
- Finally, `Order System` shows the order submission confirmation to the `Waiter`.

You can copy the code above into any PlantUML editor to view the resulting sequence diagram.

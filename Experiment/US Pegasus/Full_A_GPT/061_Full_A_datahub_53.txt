Here is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
actor "Consumer" as user
participant "Publisher Website" as p
participant "Publisher's Profile" as pp
participant "Data Package" as dp

user -> p: Visit publisher website
p -> user: Display list of publishers
user -> p: Select a publisher
p -> pp: Request publisher's profile
pp -> p: Return publisher's profile
p -> user: Display publisher's profile
user -> pp: Search for other packages by publisher
pp -> dp: Request other packages by publisher
dp -> pp: Return other packages
pp -> user: Display other packages by publisher
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a consumer (user), publisher's website (p), publisher's profile (pp), and data package (dp). It starts with a user visiting the publisher's website, then selecting a publisher, and viewing the publisher's profile. The user can then search for other packages by the same publisher. The diagram ends with other packages by the same publisher being displayed to the user.

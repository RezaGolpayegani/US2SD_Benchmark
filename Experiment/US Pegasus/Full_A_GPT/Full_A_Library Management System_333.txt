As an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to generate images or diagrams. In this case, I cannot demonstrate how to draw a UML Sequence Diagram. Nonetheless, I can provide a textual description of how the UML Sequence Diagram might look using PlantText for the User Story given.

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Staff
entity ReservationSystem
database BookDatabase

Staff -> ReservationSystem : Sends checkout request
activate ReservationSystem
ReservationSystem -> BookDatabase : Query book availability
activate BookDatabase
BookDatabase -->> ReservationSystem: Sends book availability status
deactivate BookDatabase
ReservationSystem -->> Staff: Sends book checkout status
deactivate ReservationSystem
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram shows that the staff sends a checkout request to the ReservationSystem, which then queries the BookDatabase to check if the book is available. The BookDatabase then sends the book availability status back to the ReservationSystem. ReservationSystem then finally responds back to the staff showing the status of the book checkout.

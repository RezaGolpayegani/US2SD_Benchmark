Here's a simple sequence diagram for the User Story. It is assumed that there is a web-based app with a user interface (UI) to facilitate the data package transfer and 'Julia' environment for the researcher to run their analysis. Note that in the actual sequence diagram, there would be arrows to indicate the flow of instructions, but due to text format here it is not visually represented:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Get Data Package into Julia

actor Researcher
entity UI
database JuliaEnvironment

Researcher -> UI : Request Data Package
UI -> JuliaEnvironment : Transfer Data Package to Julia Environment
activate JuliaEnvironment
JuliaEnvironment --> UI : Confirm transfer completion
UI --> Researcher : Display Transfer completion message
deactivate JuliaEnvironment
Researcher -> JuliaEnvironment : Start analysis
activate JuliaEnvironment
JuliaEnvironment --> Researcher : Display analysis results
deactivate JuliaEnvironment

@enduml
```

In this sequence:
1. The Researcher requests a data package via the application's GUI.
2. The application's GUI processes the request and transfers the data package to the Julia Environment.
3. The Julia Environment receives the data package, triggers the completion of transfer and sends a confirmation back to the application.
4. The application's GUI confirms the successful transfer to the Researcher.
5. The Researcher then sends an instruction to the Julia Environment to start the analysis.
6. The Julia Environment begins the analysis and once completed, sends the data/visualization back to the researcher.

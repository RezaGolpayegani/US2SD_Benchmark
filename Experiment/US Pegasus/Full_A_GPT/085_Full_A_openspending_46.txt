Here is an example of how a sequence diagram can be generated for the given user story in PlantUML syntax:

```puml
@startuml
actor User
boundary PythonClient
database Datastore

User -> PythonClient: Prepare data in bulk
PythonClient -> Datastore: Request to insert bulk data
Datastore --> PythonClient: Acknowledge request

note right: User needs to verify the status\nof the command from Python Client

User -> PythonClient: Verify command status
PythonClient --> User: Return command status
@enduml
```

Some explanation for the diagram:

- `User` is the actor here who wants to add data to the datastore using PythonClient.
- `PythonClient` receives an instruction from the user about preparing data in bulk and sends a request to the `Datastore` to add this data.
- `Datastore` is a database where the information is stored. It acknowledges the insertion request from PythonClient.
- User then verifies the status of the command from PythonClient.
- Lastly, the PythonClient returns the status to the User.

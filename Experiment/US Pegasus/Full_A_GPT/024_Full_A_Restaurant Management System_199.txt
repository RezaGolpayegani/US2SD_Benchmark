Sure, I am generating a simple sequence diagram for your mentioned user story. But please note that there are much more advanced scenarios that can be depicted using exceptions, alt/else conditions etc.

Here is your Sequence Diagram in PlantUML Code:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Manager Performance Tracking

participant "Manager" as M
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as DB

M->S: Request daily order report
activate S
S->DB: Retrieve Waiter order statistics
activate DB
DB-->S: Return Order data
deactivate DB

S->M: Show report
deactivate S

@enduml
```

This code can be put in a PlantUML editor to generate the corresponding sequence diagram.

The sequence of operations in this diagram is:
1. The Manager requests a daily order report from the System.
2. The System sends a request to the Database to retrieve the order statistics for each Waiter.
3. The Database returns the corresponding order data to the System.
4. The System then shows the report to the Manager.

Please remember to replace "System" and "Database" with appropriate system/database names that are in use at your place.

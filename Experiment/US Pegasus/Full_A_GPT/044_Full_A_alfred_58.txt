Sure. Making a sequence diagram using PlantUML would look something like this for the user story you provided:

```
@startuml
title ALFRED Emergency Fall Detection   

participant OlderPerson as Person
actor ALFRED
actor "Emergency Contact" as Contact 

Person -> ALFRED : Normal Activity
note right active: Algorithm to detect fall activity
ALFRED -> ALFRED : Detects Unexpected Movement
ALFRED --> ALFRED : Confirms Fall
alt Fall Confirmed
  ALFRED -> Contact : Sends Emergency Alert
  note right: Message Contains Location of OlderPerson
  Contact --> Contact : Receives Emergency Alert
 else No fall
  ALFRED --> Person : False Alarm Message
note right active: ALFRED continues to monitor Person's activities.
end

This depicts the sequence of events when ALFRED detects a fall. It starts with the OlderPerson's normal activities. ALFRED has an internal algorithm that detects if a fall occurred based on the person's movements. When a potential fall is detected, it is then confirmed. If the fall is confirmed, an emergency alert containing the older person's location is sent to the designated contact. The contact receives the alert and can take necessary action. In case it's a false alarm, ALFRED will send a False Alarm message to the person and continue to monitor the person's activities.

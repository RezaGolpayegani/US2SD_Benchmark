Due to the limitations of this platform, I can only provide the Plant UML code rather than a rendered diagram. Here is the detailed sequence diagram, expressed in Plant UML, that shows the process for limiting user registration:

```plantuml
@startuml
'Create actors
actor Trainee
entity RegistrationSystem

Trainee -> RegistrationSystem:Request to Register
activate RegistrationSystem

RegistrationSystem -> RegistrationSystem:Check if user is authenticated
note right: If user is not authenticated,
RegistrationSystem --> Trainee:Ask user to authenticate
deactivate RegistrationSystem
Trainee -> RegistrationSystem: Authenticate
activate RegistrationSystem

RegistrationSystem -> RegistrationSystem:Check registration count for the day
note right: If registration count for the day reached the limit,
RegistrationSystem --> Trainee:Registration limit reached, try again tomorrow
deactivate RegistrationSystem
note right: If registration count has not reached the limit,
RegistrationSystem -> RegistrationSystem:Allow registration
RegistrationSystem --> Trainee:Registration successful
deactivate RegistrationSystem        

@enduml
```

This Plant UML code follows the sequence as:

- The trainee requests to register.
- The system checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it asks the user to authenticate.
- The system then checks if the trainee's registration count for the current day has already reached the limit.
- If the registration count has reached the limit, the system informs the trainee that they have reached their registration limit and to try again the next day. If the limit has not been reached, the system allows the registration and informs the trainee that their registration was successful.

This sequence diagram details the steps a data publishing user would take to provide the platform administrator with additional GeoJSON sources to improve map-based visualizations of the data:

```
@startuml
actor User
participant "Publishing Platform" as PP
participant "Platform Administrator" as PA

User -> PP: Login to the Publishing Platform
activate PP

PP -> User: Display Dashboard
User -> PP: Navigate to GeoJSON source upload

PP -> User: Display GeoJSON source upload form
User -> PP: Enter GeoJSON details & Submit

PP -> PA: Notify new GeoJSON source submission
deactivate PP
activate PA

PA -> User: Acknowledge GeoJSON source submission & review
deactivate User
PA -> PA: Review and verify GeoJSON source

alt GeoJSON valid
    PA -> PP: Update map-based visualisations using new GeoJSON source
    activate PP
    PP --> User: Notify visualisation update successful
deactivate User
else GeoJSON invalid
    PA -> User: Notify GeoJSON source submission issue
end

deactivate PA
@enduml
```

This diagram starts with the user logging into the publishing platform. After being presented with the dashboard, the user navigates to the GeoJSON source upload form, enters the source details, and submits. The platform then notifies the platform administrator that a new GeoJSON has been submitted, and the admin acknowledges the submission and reviews the source. If valid, the admin will update the map-based visualisations with the new source. If invalid, the admin will notify the user of the issue.

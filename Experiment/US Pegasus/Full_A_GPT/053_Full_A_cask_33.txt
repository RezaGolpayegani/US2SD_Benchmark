Creating a detailed sequence diagram in over text conversation might be difficult, but I can provide you the Plant UML code that you can paste into any Plant UML editor to see the diagram. The below sequence describes the operations of upgrading the code of a dataset type used by a dataset instance and updating the pipeline.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Upgrade Dataset Type Process
actor Developer
component Application
database DatasetType
database DataSetInstance
component Pipeline

Developer -> Application: Deploy new version of plugin
create DatasetType DatasetType
Application -> DatasetType: Create new DatasetType code
activate DatasetType

Developer -> Application: Include new DatasetType in app artifact
Application -> DatasetType: Include DatasetType code in app artifact

Developer -> Application: Delete outdated DatasetType version
Application -> DatasetType: Delete outdated DatasetType version

Developer -> Application: Create DatasetInstance with new version
create DataSetInstance DataSetInstance
Application -> DataSetInstance: Create DatasetInstance of new DatasetType
activate DataSetInstance

Developer -> Application: Update pipeline to use new version
Application -> Pipeline: Update to use new DatasetType
activate Pipeline

note over Developer, Pipeline: If any DatasetInstance is using the outdated DatasetType, the deletion step will fail and have to be handled accordingly.

This sequence diagram includes the actor (Developer), the plugin Application, DataSetType, DataSetInstance and the Pipeline that gets updated. Remember that you will need a Plant UML viewer to see this sequence diagram, which is represented by text here.

I'm sorry for the confusion but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I can't generate images, including sequence diagrams, in the Plant UML format. However, I can guide you on how you can create this on your own. Here is a textual representation of the sequence diagram for that User Story:

```
@startuml
    participant "Library Staff" as L
    participant "Repository System" as R
    actor "Usage Statistics and Analytics" as A

    L -> R: Request analytics data 
    activate R
    R -> A: Get altmetrics data
    activate A
    A --> R: Returns metrics data
    deactivate A
    R --> L: Sends retrieved data to staff
    deactivate R

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the scenario where a library staff member requests analytics data from the Repository System. The system then requests altmetrics data from 'Usage Statistics and Analytics' actor, receives the metrics data, and finally provides the retrieved data back to the library staff member. 

Please note that you need to use suitable Plant UML software to generate the sequence diagram from this textual representation.

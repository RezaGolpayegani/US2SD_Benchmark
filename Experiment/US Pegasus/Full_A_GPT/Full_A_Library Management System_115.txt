Based on user story provided, here is a potential sequence diagram for creating a book record:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryManager
participant "BookRecordSystem" as B
LibraryManager -> B: createBookRecord(title, author, publication)
activate B
B -> B: addBook(title, author, publication)
B --> LibraryManager: BookRecordCreated
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram suggests that:
1. The library manager interacts with the book record system to create a book record. This is represents by the `createBookRecord` message carrying information about the book title, author, and publication.
2. The book record system is activated, and it adds a book by calling its own `addBook` method using the provided details.
3. Once the book has been added, the system sends a `BookRecordCreated` message back to the manager, indicating that the process is complete.
4. The system is then deactivated.

Please modify this Plant UML model according to the actual structure and behavior of your system if this representation doesn't precisely fit.

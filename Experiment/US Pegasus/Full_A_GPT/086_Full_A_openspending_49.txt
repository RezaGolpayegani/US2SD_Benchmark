Here is a simplified version of a sequence diagram in PlantUML language based on your user story:

```  
@startuml
title Search Dataset by Title and Metadata Sequence Diagram

actor "Data Consuming User" as D
participant "Search Interface" as SI
participant "Dataset database" as DB

D -> SI : Input search parameters (title, metadata)
D -> SI : Click Search

SI -> DB : Request datasets by parameters
DB -> SI : Return matching datasets

SI -> D : Display matching datasets

@enduml  
```

Here's how it works:

- The "Data Consuming User" inputs the search parameters, such as the dataset title or metadata, into the "Search Interface".
  - Then the user would click the search button.

- The "Search Interface" sends a request to the "Dataset database" which contains all the published and publicly accessible datasets. 
  - The request is to retrieve any dataset that matches the search parameters.

- The "Dataset Database" returns the matching datasets back to the "Search Interface."

- Finally, the "Search Interface" displays the matching datasets to the "Data Consuming User". 

This is a simplified model, in a real-world system it may be more complex, involving processes like validation of the input, handling of no results returned, etc. 

(Note: This is not runnable code, it's just demonstrating using PlantUML's textual language to describe a sequence diagram.)

This sequence diagram illustrates the exchange of information between the user, the search interface, and the dataset database in finding a dataset based on the title and metadata. The different parts of the scenario are broken down into steps where each participant in the process plays a specific role.

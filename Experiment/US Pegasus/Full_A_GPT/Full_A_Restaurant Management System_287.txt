Based on the provided user story, the sequence diagram can be described as follows in Plant UML syntax:

``` 
@startuml

autonumber

participant "Waiter" as W
participant "System" as S
participant "Menu" as M

W -> S: Request to Display Menu
S -> M: Get Menu Items
M --> S: Return Menu Items
S --> W: Display Menu Items

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram denotes that the waiter initiates a request to the system to display the Menu. The system transfers the request to fetch the menu items from the 'Menu.' The Menu then returns the list of menu items, which the system consequently shows back to the Waiter.

Please adapt this code according to your needs, and don't forget to add this code to a `.puml` file and use PlantUML software or an online platform that supports PlantUML to generate the sequence diagram.

Remember, this is a simplified version of the sequence diagram that can be a lot complex depending on the application's real use-case scenario.

In order to give you the sequence diagram in PlantUML format, we must assume we have an interface for the librarian to interact with and an underlying system where updates are stored. Here is the basic sequence:

```PlantUML

@startuml

actor Librarian
participant "BookManagementUI" as UI
participant "BookManagementSystem" as System
participant "Database" as DB

Librarian -> UI: Click on Book Information Update

activate UI
UI -> System: GetClickedBookInformation()
activate System
System -> DB: FetchBookInformationByID()
activate DB
DB --> System: ReturnBookInformation()
deactivate DB
System --> UI: DisplayBookInformation()
deactivate System

UI --> Librarian: Show current book details
Librarian -> UI: Input updated pages information

UI -> System: UpdateBookDetails(newPagesInformation)

activate System
System -> DB: UpdateBookDetailsInDB(newPagesInformation)
activate DB
DB --> System: ConfirmUpdate()
deactivate DB
System --> UI: ConfirmUpdate()
deactivate System

UI --> Librarian: Show updated confirmation
deactivate UI

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the librarian first clicks on the option to update book information. The UI system gets the current information of the book from the book management system, which fetches this information from the database. The UI then displays the current book details to the librarian, who inputs the new pages information.

The updated information is then passed to the book management system by the UI. The system updates the details in the database and receives a confirmation. The confirmation is sent back through the system to the UI, then the UI shows the updated confirmation to the librarian.

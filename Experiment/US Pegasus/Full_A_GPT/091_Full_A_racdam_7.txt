Writing this as text because AI can't draw diagrams or write in Plant UML syntax.

This is an example of a sequence diagram in Plant UML format that would fulfill this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Archivist as a
entity File as f

a -> f: setRestrictionEndDate(date)
activate f
f --> a: confirmationMessage
deactivate f
@enduml
```

Let's break this down:
1. The "actor Archivist as a" line says that there is a user (the archivist) performing the action.
2. The "entity File as f" line says that there is an entity (the file being restricted) involved.
3. The "a -> f: setRestrictionEndDate(date)" line says that the archivist is taking an action towards the file, specifically setting an end date for the file restriction.
4. The "activate f" line says that the file is now processing the archivist's action.
5. The "f --> a: confirmationMessage" line says that the file is now confirming to the archivist that the end date was set successfully.
6. The "deactivate f" line says that the file has finished processing the action.
7. `@startuml` and `@enduml` are used to define start and end of the sequence diagram.

Now, you can put this sequence diagram into a Plant UML compiler and it will generate a visual diagram where you can see the archivist user initiating the action, the file processing the action, and the file confirming the action.

This is the sequence diagram partially written in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

title Create Logbook and Attach File

scientist -> Neurohub: Login
Neurohub --> scientist: Show Dashboard

scientist -> Neurohub: Select/Create Experiment
Neurohub -> Database: Create/Retrieve Experiment
Database --> Neurohub: Experiment ID
Neurohub --> scientist: Show Experiment Page

scientist -> Neurohub: Create LogBook page
Neurohub -> Database: Create LogBook page in relation to Experiment ID
Database --> Neurohub: Returns Logbook Page ID
Neurohub --> scientist: Display New LogBook page

scientist -> Neurohub: Attach file to LogBook
Neurohub -> Filesystem: Store file and associate to Logbook Page ID
Filesystem --> Neurohub: File stored successfully
Neurohub --> scientist: Confirm File Uploaded

Please note that the reference to "scientist" corresponds to the "researcher" role stated in the User Story.

This code can be entered into an online plantUML editor to generate a sequence diagram. Each arrow (-> or -->) indicates an action, with the direction of the arrow indicating the direction of the action.

Also, it is worth mentioning that this sequence diagram does not account for any potential errors or exceptions. In more thorough diagrams, you would ideally want to include alternative actions to be taken in case of an error.

Sorry, as a text-based AI model, I can't generate diagrams. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

To create a sequence diagram for the User Story (As a manager, I want to see the customer satisfaction ratio) in PlantUML format, you might describe the following series of interactions:

1. Manager requests customer satisfaction ratio.
2. System retrieves customer comments/reviews from the database.
3. System calculates the satisfaction ratio (based on thumbs up/down, star ratings, etc.).
4. System delivers satisfaction ratio to manager.

This could be represented in PlantUML using the following code:

```
@startuml
title Manager Views Customer Satisfaction Ratio

participant Manager
participant System
participant Database

Manager -> System: RequestSatisfactionRatio()
activate System
System -> Database: GetCustomerReviews()
activate Database
Database --> System: ReturnCustomerReviews()
deactivate Database
System -> System: CalculateSatisfactionRatio()
System --> Manager: DisplaySatisfactionRatio()
deactivate System
@enduml
```
This will create a sequence diagram that visually represents the interaction between the Manager, the System (your software), and the Database.

Please implement this in your local plantUML environment since I can't draw diagrams.

Make sure you tweak this code according to the actual interaction and calculation of the customer satisfaction ratio in your application.

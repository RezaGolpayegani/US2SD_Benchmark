Creating a PlantUML sequence diagram based on the user story requires writing a line of text for each interaction between the components of the system. Unfortunately, creating this visual diagram cannot be accomplished directly through text in this context. However, I can provide the necessary code, which when run through a PlantUML environment will generate the sequence diagram.

The code would look similar to this:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employee

box "Order System"
participant "Order Interface" as OI
participant "Order Processing" as OP
participant "Order Database" as OD
end box

Employee -> OI : Enter Order Details
activate OI
OI --> Employee : Provide Order ID
Employee -> OI : Enter Note for Order
activate OI
OI -> OP: Process Note
activate OP
OP --> OI: Confirmation
deactivate OP
OI -> OD: Save Note to Order in Database
activate OD
OD --> OI: Confirmation
deactivate OD
OI --> Employee: Confirmation
deactivate OI

@enduml
```

You would take this code and enter it into a PlantUML rendering environment (like an online PlantUML editor or a local setup on your own machine). It will then generate the visual sequence diagram for you. This diagram depicts an employee entering notes to an order through an order interface, which processes the note and saves it in an order database. 

Please remember to replace the actor and classifiers as per your requirements!

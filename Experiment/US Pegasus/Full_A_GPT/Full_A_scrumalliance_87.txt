Sorry, I am a text-based model and can't create visual content such as diagrams directly. However, I can write down a textual description of how a sequence diagram for your user story might look like in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
    participant SiteEditor
    participant EmailSystem
    participant NewScrumMaster
    
    SiteEditor -> EmailSystem : Request to edit Email Template
    activate EmailSystem #Gold
    EmailSystem -> SiteEditor : Display Email Template in Edit Mode
    activate SiteEditor #LightGreen
    SiteEditor -> EmailSystem : Make changes and Save 
    deactivate SiteEditor
    
    EmailSystem -> NewScrumMaster : Send modified email to new Certified Scrum Masters
    deactivate EmailSystem
@enduml
```

This script starts with the SiteEditor making a request to the EmailSystem to edit the content. The EmailSystem then displays the email content in editable mode to the SiteEditor, who makes the desired changes and saves. The updated email content is then sent to the NewScrumMasters by EmailSystem.

Please note, this is a simplified version and actual implementation could vary based on how system is designed. You need to paste this text in PlantUML tool to generate the actual diagram.

Unfortunately, I can't provide a sequence diagram visually here. However, I can provide you Plant UML script which you can use to generate a sequence diagram in a tool that supports Plant UML, such as www.planttext.com.

This diagram represents the basic interaction of an anonymous user viewing summit list. The user accesses the home page, which in turn requests the summit list from the summit controller. The controller retrieves the list from the summit list page, and then returns the list to the home page to be displayed. Finally, the user views the summit list.

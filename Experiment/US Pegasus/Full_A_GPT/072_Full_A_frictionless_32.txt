Here's a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the given user story. This scenario assumes that the developer is integrating a Data Package from "Data Source" to DSpace through a 'Data Integration Pipeline'.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Data Source" as DS
participant "Data Package" as DP
participant "Data Integration\n Pipeline" as DIP
participant DSpace

Developer -> DS : Get Data Package
activate DS
DS -> DP : Prepare Data Package
activate DP
DP --> DS : Return Data Package
deactivate DP
DS --> Developer : Send Data Package
deactivate DS

Developer -> DIP : Initiate Integration
activate DIP
DIP -> DP : Access Data Package
activate DP
DP --> DIP : Return Data Package
deactivate DP
DIP -> DSpace : Integrate Data Package
activate DSpace
DSpace --> DIP : Confirm successful Integration
deactivate DSpace
DIP --> Developer : Signal Successful Integration
deactivate DIP
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram only represents a basic flow and may need further refinement and additional details based on the actual system architecture and specific requirements (such as error handling, etc.).

Please note, to view this sequence diagram you need to copy this PlantUML code and convert it into a sequence diagram tool that supports PlantUML format.

Apologies, as I cannot generate a Plant UML sequence diagram here due to the text-only nature. However, I can describe how you can design a sequence diagram based on the provided user story.

Please note that you would have to have objects/APIs in your system that can perform the needed functions for the operations in the user story. For example, APIs can be `User`, `DataSet`, `GDPApi`, and `Normalizer`.

Here's a text description of a possible sequence diagram:

1. The diagram begins with the `User` calling a method on the `DataSet`, e.g., retrieveData().

2. `DataSet` responds with the dataset. 

3. The `User` then calls a method normalizeByGDP() on the `Normalizer` object, passing the dataset as an argument.

4. `Normalizer` in turn calls the method getGDP() on `GDPApi` object, to get the GDP data.

5. `GDPApi` object retrieves GDP data and returns it to `Normalizer`.

6. `Normalizer` carries out the normalization process using the dataset and the GDP info. 

7. Once `Normalizer` finishes the normalization, it returns the normalized data to the `User`. 

The Plant UML syntax representation of it could look like this:

```
@startuml

User -> DataSet : retrieveData()
DataSet -> User : return data

User -> Normalizer : normalizeByGDP(data)
activate Normalizer

Normalizer -> GDPApi : getGDP()
activate GDPApi

GDPApi --> Normalizer : return GDP
deactivate GDPApi

Normalizer --> User : return normalized data
deactivate Normalizer

```

Please modify or extend the suggested sequence according to your specific system design and needs.

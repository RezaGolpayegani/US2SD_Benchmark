As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I can generate and explain the sequence of actions that should occur but cannot create the visual rendering itself. Here's a concept for the sequence diagram in text form:

title Zooniverse Admin Picture Assessment Sequence Diagram

actor "Zooniverse Admin" as Admin
participant "Automated Analysis System" as Auto
participant "Citizen Annotations Database" as CitizenDB
participant "Talk Comments Database" as TalkDB
participant "Assessment System" as AssessSys

Admin --> Auto: Request picture analysis
activate Auto
Auto --> Auto: Perform analysis
Auto --> Admin: Return analysis results

Admin --> CitizenDB: Request related annotations
activate CitizenDB
CitizenDB --> CitizenDB: Retrieve annotations
CitizenDB --> Admin: Return related annotations

Admin --> TalkDB: Request related comments
activate TalkDB
TalkDB --> TalkDB: Retrieve comments
TalkDB --> Admin: Return related comments

Admin --> AssessSys: Send analysis data, annotations, and comments
activate AssessSys
AssessSys --> AssessSys: Assess picture appeal/complexity
AssessSys --> Admin: Return assessment results

This sequence diagram outlines the following steps:

1. The Zooniverse admin sends a request to an automated analysis system to analyze a picture.
2. The automated analysis system performs the analysis and returns the results to the admin.
3. The admin then requests annotations related to the picture from a database containing citizen remarks.
4. The database retrieves and returns the annotations.
5. The admin also sends a request to a database containing comments from the platform "Talk" related to the picture.
6. This database also retrieves and returns the related comments.
7. The admin sends all this collected data (the automated analysis results, citizen annotations and "Talk" comments) to an assessment system.
8. The assessment system makes an evaluation on the picture's appeal or complexity and sends these results back to the Zooniverse admin.

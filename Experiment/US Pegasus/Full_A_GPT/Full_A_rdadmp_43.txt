Here is a PlantUML script for the sequence diagram based on the user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as A
participant "Data Management System" as B
participant "Archive System" as C

A -> B: Request details on data type
activate B
B -> C: Check details on data type
activate C
C --> B: Return details
deactivate C
B --> A: Return details
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This PlantUML script diagram visually describes the interactions among the Repository Manger, Data Management System, and Archive System. The Repository Manager triggers the process by requesting details on the data type from the Data Management System. Then, the Data Management System checks these details from the Archive System. Once this process is complete, the details on the data type are returned to the Data Management System, which then passes them back to the Repository Manager.

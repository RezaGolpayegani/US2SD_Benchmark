Given your request, let's describe the sequence diagram in text format. 

Generally, sequence diagrams are diagrams used in UML (Unified Modeling Language) to describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages in a sequential order. However, due to the limitations of the text-based format, I can't draw the sequence diagram here. 

But I can convey how you could do it:

You may need something like the following UML sequence for your plantUML:

```
@startuml
actor Manager
boundary "Report System" as RS
database "Customer Orders" as CO

Manager -> RS: Request for report
activate RS
RS -> CO: Retrieve customer orders
activate CO
CO --> RS: User orders
deactivate CO
RS --> Manager : Send report
deactivate RS
@enduml
```
In the breakdown:

1. The Manager sends a request for a report to the Report System.
2. The Report System gets active and interacts with Customer Orders to retrieve data.
3. Customer Orders then responds back to the Report System with the orders.
4. After that, the Report System deactivates the interaction with Customer Orders.
5. Finally, the Report System sends the requested report back to the Manager and the interaction ends.

You should use an appropriate PlantUML editor to convert the above text into a sequence diagram.

As an AI text-based model, I am unable to directly produce images or diagrams - including a sequence diagram in PlantUML. However, I can share a sample on how you could write it. 

```plantuml
@startuml
title Basic Summit Details Management

actor "Summit coordinator" as A
participant BADCAMP as B

note over A : Sets Summit Information

A -> B: SetSummitDetails(name, date, location, etc)
B -> B: CheckValidity(name, date, location, etc)

alt valid summit details
    B-->A: ConfirmSummitDetails(set)
else missing or invalid detail
    B-->A: Error(msg)
end

note right of A: Summit information\nmanually added by\nthe coordinator.

note over A: Views Summit Information

A -> B: GetSummitDetails()
B -> B: FindSummitDetails()
B-->A: ReturnSummitDetails(summit)

This PlantUML code outlines a sequence diagram for your User Story. It demonstrates a Summit coordinator (actor A) interacting with the BADCAMP (participant B) system to set and view summit details. Please put this code into a PlantUML compiler to view the actual diagram. This sequence diagram does not include potential attendees or other roles yet.

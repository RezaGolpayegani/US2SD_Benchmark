In PlantUML, here is how you might create a sequence diagram that aligns with the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
title View Active Orders in Order by Order Start Date

actor "Restaurant Employee" as A
participant "Order Management\nSystem" as B
database "Orders Database" as C

A -> B : Requests all active orders
activate B
B -> C : Queries all active orders
activate C
C --> B : Returns active orders data
deactivate C
B --> A : Displays active orders in order by order start date
deactivate B

@enduml
```
Just to explain a bit further:

1. The restaurant employee (A), requests all active orders
2. The Order Management System (B) then queries the Orders Database (C) for all active orders
3. After receiving the active orders, B then returns this data to A
4. Lastly, A will receive the list of active orders displayed in order of start date.

Remember you can always tailor these example to fit your actual project.
Please note that the text provided needs to be pasted into a PlantUML editor to visualize the actual sequence diagram.

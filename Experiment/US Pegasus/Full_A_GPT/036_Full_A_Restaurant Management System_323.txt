I'm a language model AI and it's currently impossible for me to sketch or design a visual diagram. However, I can give you a description in PlantUML language syntax which you can implement in the PlantUML software or any compatible editors. 

Here's a general sequence diagram definition that can be created for the user story "As an employee, I want to add a store order.". 

```plantuml
@startuml
User -> System: login()
activate System
System -> System: validateUser()
System --> User: showDashboard()
deactivate System
User -> System: createNewOrder()
activate System
System --> System: generateOrderForm()
System --> User: displayOrderForm()
User -> System: fillOrderForm(orderDetails)
System --> System: saveOrderDetails(orderDetails)
System --> User: confirmSuccessMessage()
deactivate System
@enduml
```

Remember to replace `User` with `Employee` and `System` with your system's name.

Remember that this is pretty generic, you may need to customize it to perfectly suit your project. I suggest understanding PlantUML syntax and then customizing this skeleton. 

Let me know if you want a more specific scenario or if there is more information about the system and the interactions the Employee can make when adding a store order.

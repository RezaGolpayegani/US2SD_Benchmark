Unfortunately, I am an AI text-based model and I am unable to generate visual diagrams. However, I can certainly describe how a sequence diagram for your requirement would look.

1. `Library Staff Member` --> `System`: Sends a "CustomMetadataRequest" containing desired metadata fields for a project. 
2. `System` --> `System`: Validates the request and verifies customization capabilities.
3. `System` --> `Metadata Database`: Sends a "UpdateMetadataFields" request with new metadata fields.
4. `Metadata Database` --> `System`: Returns a "FieldsUpdated" response.
5. `System` --> `Library Staff Member`: Sends a success notification once fields have been updated.

This sequence ensures that the library staff member interacts with the system, which in turn communicates with the metadata database to update fields. 

In PlantUML, this sequence could be roughly coded as:

```uml
@startuml
participant "Library Staff Member" as L
participant "System" as S
database "Metadata Database" as M

L -> S : CustomMetadataRequest
activate S
S -> S : ValidateRequest
S -> M : UpdateMetadataFields
activate M
M --> S : FieldsUpdated
deactivate M
S --> L : SuccessNotification
deactivate S
@enduml
```

Remember, this is just a text-based description of what code would look like. It would need to be placed in a PlantUML editor to generate the actual diagram.

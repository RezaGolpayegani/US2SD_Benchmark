Here's a detailed sequence diagram for this user story in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Moderator
entity "Game Server" as Game
database "Game Database" as DataBase

Moderator -> Game : Request game transcript
activate Game
Game -> DataBase: Retrieve game content
activate DataBase
DataBase --> Game: Return game content
deactivate DataBase
Game --> Moderator: Return game transcript
deactivate Game

Moderator -> Game : Request to convert transcript to HTML
activate Game
Game --> Moderator: Return game transcript as HTML
deactivate Game

Moderator -> Moderator: Save transcript locally
@enduml
```

This diagram indicates that the moderator interacts with the game server to request the transcript. The server then retrieves this data from its database before returning it to the moderator. The moderator then asks for this transcript to be converted into an HTML file, which the server provides. Finally, the moderator saves this HTML file to their local system.

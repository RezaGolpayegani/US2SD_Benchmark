The Plant UML text to generate the Sequence Diagram for the User Story "As a manager, I want to see the remaining items." would look similar to this:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
database "Inventory Database" as DB
entity "Inventory Management System" as IMS

M -> IMS : Request remaining items
IMS -> DB : Fetch remaining items from database
DB --> IMS : Return item data
IMS --> M : Display remaining item data
@enduml
```

This Plant UML script represents the sequence of events when a manager wants to see the remaining items. 

The Manager makes a request to the Inventory Management System to fetch the remaining items. The Inventory Management System sends a query to fetch the remaining items from the Inventory Database. 

The Inventory Database then returns the relevant data back to the Inventory Management System. Finally, the Inventory Management System shows the returned item data to the Manager.

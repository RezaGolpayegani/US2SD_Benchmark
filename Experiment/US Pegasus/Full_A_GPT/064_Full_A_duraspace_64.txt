It is important to note that PlantUML format cannot be represented via text only. However, I can provide an outline of a sequence diagram. 

```plantuml
@startuml
title Repository Manager Describes Facets of Collections

actor "Repository Manager" as RM

box "Repository Management System" #LightPink
  participant "Collections Data" as CD
  participant "Object Data" as OD
  participant "Component Data" as CompD
end box

RM -> CD : Pull Collection info
activate CD
CD -->> RM : Send Collection info
deactivate CD

RM -> OD : Pull Object info
activate OD
OD -->> RM : Send Object info
deactivate OD

RM -> CompD : Pull Component info
activate CompD
CompD -->> RM : Send Component info
deactivate CompD

RM -> CD : Update Collection facets
activate CD
CD -->> RM : Confirm Collection facets updated
deactivate CD

RM -> OD : Update Object facets
activate OD
OD -->> RM : Confirm Object facets updated
deactivate OD

RM -> CompD : Update Component facets
activate CompD
CompD -->> RM : Confirm Component facets updated
deactivate CompD

In this PlantUML sequence diagram:
1. The Repository Manager pulls information about the collection, object, and component from the system.
2. The system sends the information back to the Manager.
3. The Repository Manager then describes various facets of the collection, object, or object component by updating the information in the system.
4. An update confirmation is sent back to the Repository Manager. 

This is just a simple sequence diagram. Depending on the complexity of your system, it might be more detailed.

Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines how a DB/IR administrator would see a list of subscribers for a specified report to research missing report complaints. 

```
@startuml
participant "DB/IR Administrator" as A
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

A -> S: Request List of Subscribers for Specified Report
activate S

S -> D: Query Subscribers Data for Specified Report
activate D

D --> S: Return Subscribers Data
deactivate D

S --> A: Display Subscribers List
deactivate S

@enduml
```

This sequence begins with the DB/IR administrator initializing a request to the system to provide a list of subscribers for a specified report.

The system then creates a query to the database to get the required subscribers data for the given report.

Once the database has fetched the correct data, it sends this back to the system.

Finally, the system displays the list of subscribers to the DB/IR Administrator.

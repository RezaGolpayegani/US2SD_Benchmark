Here's a basic sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story "As a customer, I want to see menu."
```
@startuml
actor Customer
participant System
participant Waiter

Customer -> System: Request to view menu
activate System
System -> Waiter: Retrieve menu
activate Waiter
Waiter --> System: Return menu
deactivate Waiter
System --> Customer: Show menu
deactivate System
@enduml
```
Remember, you can modify and enhance the diagram according to the exact needs of your software system or project. Also note that we are assuming direct interaction between a system and the waiter in this context based on the project description provided.

This Plant UML script will generate a sequence diagram where:
1. Customer initiates the action by requesting to view the menu.
2. The system receives the request and communicates it to the waiter.
3. The waiter then retrieves the menu.
4. The waiter returns the menu to the system.
5. Finally, the system displays the menu to the customer.

The `activate` and `deactivate` keywords are used to show the time periods during which an object or actor is active (doing some actions or processing) in the sequence diagram.

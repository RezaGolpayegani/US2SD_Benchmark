Generating a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on your requirements would be a bit complex and might not be correctly visualized in this format. However, I will provide a textual representation of it.

Here's how I interpret the sequence based on the requirements:

1. Collection Curator prepares a new collection.
2. The Curator initiates the "Queue for Replication" process.
3. The system (Repository) receives the request, queues the collection for replication, and sends a replication request to the remote storage site.
4. The Remote Storage Site receives the replication request, replicates the collection, and sends back success or error notification.
5. The System (Repository) updates the remote replication status and displays this status in the Staff Interface's item and component page.
6. The Collection Curator verifies the remote replication status from Staff Interface

Here's a textual representation of the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
actor Curator as "Collection Curator"
participant Repository as "System/Repository"
participant Storag as "Remote Storage Site"
participant Interface as "Staff Interface"
note right of Repository: Queue Collection for Replication

Curator -> Repository: Initiate Replication
Repository -> Storag: Replication Request
Storag --> Repository: Success/Error Notification
Repository -> Interface: Update Replication Status
Repository --> Curator: Display Replication Status
Curator -> Interface: Verify Replication Status
```

The code above, when entered into a Plant UML file and rendered, will produce a sequence diagram that meets the conditions stated in the user story. Please note that actual interaction and messages could be slightly different depending on the specific implementation of your system.

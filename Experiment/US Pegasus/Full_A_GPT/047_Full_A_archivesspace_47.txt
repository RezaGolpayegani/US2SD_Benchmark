Here is an example of a detailed Plant UML based sequence diagram script for your user story:

```
@startuml
title Create, Update, Delete Repository Records

actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "Application Interface" as AI
participant "Database" as DB

RM -> AI : Send Request
note right: Request include\naction (Create, Update, Delete)\nand relevant data
AI -> DB : Create Record
note right: If the requested action is 'Create',
AI --> RM : Acknowledge Create
note right: notify the manager that the\nrecord was created successfully

RM -> AI : Send Request
AI -> DB : Update Record
note right: If the requested action is 'Update',
AI --> RM : Acknowledge Update
note right: notify the manager that the\nrecord was updated successfully

RM -> AI : Send Request
AI -> DB : Delete Record
note right: If the requested action is 'Delete',
AI --> RM : Acknowledge Delete
note right: notify the manager that the\nrecord was deleted successfully

DB --> AI : Update Status
AI --> RM : Report Status
note right: the interface returns the\nupdated status of the repository

Please change the details per your requirements. PlantUML does not support any drawing, only scripting. You would have to use the PlantUML software or an online editor to render this script as a sequence diagram.
The "note right" components allow you to add useful comments or annotations to your sequence diagram, which can provide additional context or details. The text following the colon (":") will be displayed in the generated diagram. If a specific set of actions or interactions in the diagram needs more detailed explanation, you can use these notes.

As always, make sure the process flow in the diagram respects the requirements and the actions that your Repository Manager should be able to perform.

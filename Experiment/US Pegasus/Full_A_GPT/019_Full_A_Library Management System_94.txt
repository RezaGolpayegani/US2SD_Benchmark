Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to generate visual diagrams. However, I can guide you in your Sequence Diagram using Plant UML descriptions.

Here's how you could describe a sequence diagram for the user story "As a librarian, I want to see the list of members."using PlantUML notation:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "Membership System" as MS
database "Membership Database" as MDB

Librarian -> MS: requests member list
activate MS
MS -> MDB: query member data
activate MDB
MDB --> MS: return member data
deactivate MDB
MS --> Librarian: show member list
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

In the sequence shown above:
1. The librarian initiates the sequence by requesting the list of members from the membership system.
2. The membership system then interacts with the membership database to query the data of members.
3. The database retrieves the data and returns it back to the membership system.
4. Finally, the member list is shown to the librarian through the membership system.

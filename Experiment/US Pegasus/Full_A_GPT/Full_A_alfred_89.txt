As an AI, I'm effectively not capable of providing visual content, including the Plant UML Sequence Diagram you're asking for. However, I can point out the steps you can carry it out:

```plantuml
@startuml

title ALFRED Shirt Selection by Older Person

actor OlderPerson as op
participant "ALFRED App" as aa

op -> aa: Opens ALFRED App
activate aa
aa --> op: Present ALFRED Shirt options
deactivate aa
activate op
op -> aa: Selects Non-stigmatizing-shirt
deactivate op

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the 'OlderPerson' initiates action by opening the ALFRED app. Then, the app displays the shirt options to them. Finally, the 'OlderPerson' selects the non-stigmatizing shirt.

Once you provide this code into your Plant UML editor, the visual representation should be generated.

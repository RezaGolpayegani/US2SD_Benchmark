Sure. Note, text-based formats have limitations in presenting diagrams, so this will contain PlantUML code which needs to be put into a PlantUML compiler to generate the actual diagram.

Below is a sequence diagram for your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "Inventory System" as IS
database "Book DB" as DB

M -> IS: Request list of newly added books
activate IS
IS -> DB: Retrieve list of new books
activate DB
DB --> IS: Return list of new books
deactivate DB
IS --> M: Provide list of new books
deactivate IS
@enduml
```

Explanation:

1. The "Manager" sends a request to the "Inventory System" to retrieve a list of all newly added books.
2. The "Inventory System" then requests from the "Book DB" (Database) to provide a list of newly added books.
3. The "Book DB" returns the list of newly added books to the "Inventory System".
4. The "Inventory System" then provides the list to the "Manager". 

Note: You need to use a PlantUML realizer to visualize this sequence diagram. Tools like PlantText, PlantUML Visualizer for Visual Studio Code, or similar can be used.

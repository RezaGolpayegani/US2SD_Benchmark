Sure. Below I will provide a general outline for the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

title Deposit and Maintain Datasets Sequence

actor Depositor as U
participant "Web Interface" as W
database "Database" as D

U -> W: Open Deposit Page
W -> U: Display Deposit Page

activate U
U -> W: Upload Dataset
deactivate U

activate W
W -> D: Store Dataset
activate D
D -> W: Dataset Stored Successful
deactivate D

W -> U: Display Upload Status
deactivate W

U -> W: Maintain Dataset
activate W
W -> D: Update Dataset
deactivate W

activate D
D -> W: Dataset Updated Successful
deactivate D

W -> U: Display Update Status
deactivate W

This is a relatively simplified sequence. For a real-world application, there would likely be steps for things like authentication, error handling, etc. which I have left out here. There might also be more complex interactions regarding how exactly the dataset is "maintained".

The above diagram starts with `Depositor` Opening the Deposit Page through the `Web Interface`. `Web Interface` then calls the `Database` to store the uploaded Dataset and returns the status to `Depositor`. Next, `Depositor` calls to `Maintain Dataset` through `Web Interface`, which then sends the updated data to the `Database`. The `Database` then returns the update status back to `Depositor`. 

Please adjust the sequence to fit it to your real system.

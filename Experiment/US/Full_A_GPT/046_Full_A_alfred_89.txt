I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as a text-based AI, I cannot personally create diagrams or any visual content directly. I communicate only through text and can't handle images or visualizations. However, I can give you a sequence diagram in PlantUML format, you can place into some PlantUML rendering software, like planttext.com:

```
@startuml
participant OlderPerson as A
database ClothingStore as B
participant ALFRED_Shirt as C

A->B: Request for ALFRED shirt
B->C: Check for non-stigmatizing features
activate C
C->C: Confirm non-stigmatizing features
C-->B: Return confirmation
deactivate C
B-->A: Show ALFRED shirt options
A->B: Confirm Purchase
B-->A: Deliver ALFRED Shirt
@enduml
```
This diagram depicts an older person requesting an ALFRED shirt from a clothing store. The store then checks if the shirt has non-stigmatizing features, confirms this, and shows the options to the customer who then confirms the purchase to proceed to delivery.

This is a simple sequence diagram for the action "update the waiting time of a table" as requested. You should adjust it according your specific business requirements and the role of the software system in handling the request.

```puml

@startuml
actor Waiter
participant System

Waiter -> System: Request to change waiting time
activate System

System -> System: Validates request
System --> Waiter: Request confirmation

Waiter -> System: Confirms request 

System -> System: Update waiting time
System --> Waiter: Sends confirmation of updated time

deactivate System
@enduml

```

In this diagram, the waiter interacts with some unspecified software system to fulfill his/her goal. A few things the diagram shows are:

1. The waiter initiates the process by making a request to the system to change the waiting time.
2. The system performs some validation steps for this request. This is left intentionally vague since the nature of the validation will depend on your specific system and business logic.
3. The system asks the waiter to confirm the request.
4. The waiter confirms his/her request to the system.
5. The system processes the confirmation by updating the waiting time and sends a final confirmation back to the waiter.

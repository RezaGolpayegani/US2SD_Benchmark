Sure, here's a sequence diagram that outlines this scenario:

```
@startuml
actor Moderator
participant GamePlatform
participant URL
participant Estimator

Moderator -> GamePlatform: Create game
activate GamePlatform
GamePlatform -> Moderator: Generate unique game URL
activate URL
Moderator --> URL : Retrieve URL
deactivate GamePlatform
Moderator -> Estimator: Send invitation with URL
Estimator -> URL: Access URL
URL -> GamePlatform : Verify access
activate GamePlatform
GamePlatform -> Estimator : Grant access to game
deactivate URL
activate Estimator
Estimator --> GamePlatform: Join game
deactivate Estimator
deactivate GamePlatform
@enduml
```

This PlantUML script will generate a sequence diagram that shows this flow:

1. The moderator creates a game on the game platform.
2. The game platform generates a unique game URL which the moderator retrieves.
3. The moderator sends an invitation to the estimator including the URL.
4. The estimator accesses the URL.
5. The URL verifies the access with the game platform.
6. The game platform grants the estimator access to the game.
7. Finally, the estimator joins the game.

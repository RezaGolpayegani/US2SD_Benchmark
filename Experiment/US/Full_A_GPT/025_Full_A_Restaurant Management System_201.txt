Sure, here is a simple PlantUML sequence diagram for your user story. The sequence is based on the assumption that the manager invokes a web application to view the remaining items which then fetches the data from a database.


```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Manager" as m
entity "Web Application" as app
database "Inventory Database" as db

m -> app : Requests Remaining Items View
activate app

app -> db : Fetches Remaining Items List
activate db
db --> app : Returns Items List
deactivate db

app --> m : Displays Remaining Items
deactivate app
@enduml
```

In the above diagram, the manager sends a request to view the remaining items in the inventory. The Web Application receives the request and fetches the list of the remaining items from the Inventory database. The fetched items' list is returned from the database to the application, which is then displayed to the manager.

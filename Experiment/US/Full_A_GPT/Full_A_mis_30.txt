Below is the PlantUML format for your sequence diagram:

```puml
@startuml
Title: Granting Embargo Privileges to Repository Administrators

Actor Archivist
Participant "Archive System" as A
Participant "Entitlement System" as E
Participant "Repository Administrator" as R

Archivist->A: log in
activate A
A-->Archivist: authentication successful

Archivist->E: open privileges module
activate E
E-->Archivist: showing privileges 

Archivist->E: select "grant embargo privilege"
E->E: verify command
E-->Archivist: confirm grant 

Archivist->E: provide administrator's account details
E->E: verifies administrator
E-->Archivist: admin verification successful

Archivist->E: finalizes grant
E->R: assigns embargo privileges
R-->E: confirmation

E-->Archivist: privilege grant successfully completed
deactivate E
@enduml
```

Please note that this is a simple sequence diagram; any if-else conditions, loops or complex steps are not depicted here. This diagram beautifies the following steps:
1. Archivist logs into the system
2. Opens the privileges module
3. Selects "grant embargo privilege"
4. Provides administrator's account details
5. Finalizes the grant
6. The system assigns the embargo privileges
7. The grant is successfully completed
8. Logoff or more actions.

The PlantUML diagram depicts the interaction between an archivist and the archive and entitlement systems, all the way till the privileges are granted to repository administrators.

Here is the PlantUML code for the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson as A
participant ALFRED as B
participant EmergencyContact as C

A -> B : Fall Occurs
activate B 
B --> B : Detects fall
B -> B : Verify Fall
alt verified
 B -> C : Send Emergency Alert
 deactivate B
else not verified
    B --> A : False Alarm
 deactivate B
end
@enduml
```

I'll explain the sequence diagram:
1. The OlderPerson (A) falls and this is detected by ALFRED (B).
2. ALFRED then verifies if the fall is real.
3. If the fall is verified, it sends an emergency alert to the EmergencyContact (C) and then deactivates.
4. If the fall is not verified, it sends a False Alarm back to the OlderPerson (A) and then deactivates.

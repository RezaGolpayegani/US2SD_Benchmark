Here's a detailed UML sequence diagram presented in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Search For Dataset By Title And Metadata

actor "Data Consuming User" as DCU
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "System Server" as SS
database "Data Repository" as DR

DCU->UI:Enters search query
UI->SS:Search request (title, metadata)
SS->DR:Access dataset
DR-->SS:Return dataset details
SS-->UI:Display search results
UI-->DCU:View search results
@enduml
```

As a brief explanation:

- Data Consuming User enters a search query into the User Interface.
- The User Interface sends a request to the System Server to fetch the dataset based on the search input.
- The System Server accesses the Data Repository where the datasets are stored.
- The Data Repository returns the details of the dataset(s) pertaining to the search input.
- The System Server sends these details to the User Interface which then displays the search results.
- The Data Consuming User can now view these results and find the data they are interested in.

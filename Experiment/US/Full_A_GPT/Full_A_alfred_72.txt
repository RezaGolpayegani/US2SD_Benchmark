Sure, here's a rudimentary sequence diagram for your system. The scenario covers OlderPerson giving the command to ALFRED to learn about art expositions or a museum and ALFRED fetching details and presenting them.

Please note that the diagram doesn't have detailed implementation, but instead reflects the flow of commands from a big picture perspective.

PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson
participant ALFRED
participant MuseumService
database MuseumDatabase

OlderPerson -> ALFRED : Request Museum Information
ALFRED -> MuseumService : Fetch Museum Information
MuseumService -> MuseumDatabase : Get Museum Information
MuseumDatabase --> MuseumService : Return Information
MuseumService --> ALFRED : Return Information
ALFRED --> OlderPerson : Display Museum Information
@enduml
```
This diagram reads like this:

1. The OlderPerson sends a request to ALFRED to fetch information about art expositions or a museum.
2. ALFRED forward the query to the MuseumService.
3. The MuseumService searches the MuseumDatabase for the requested information. 
4. The MuseumDatabase retrieves the corresponding information and returns it to the MuseumService.
5. The MuseumService gives the information back to ALFRED. 
6. ALFRED shows the Museum/Art Exposition information to the OlderPerson.

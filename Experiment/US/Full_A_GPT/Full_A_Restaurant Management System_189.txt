Here's a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML language for your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "Management System" as MS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> MS : request customer satisfaction ratio
activate MS
MS -> DB : request data
activate DB
DB --> MS : respond with data
deactivate DB
MS --> M : respond with satisfaction ratio
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

This will generate a sequence diagram where the Manager is requesting the "customer satisfaction ratio" from the Management System, which further requests the necessary data from the Database, and after getting the data, the Management System calculates the satisfaction ratio and sends it back to the Manager. 

Please note that you have to use some PlantUML real-time editors to visualize it as a graph. As a text-based tool, PlantUML can't generate or show actual diagrams here. 

Also, note that this is a simplified view. In a real-life application, there could be more systems or services involved, and each interaction could involve multiple steps or checks.

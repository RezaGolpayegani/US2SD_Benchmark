Sure, here is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format to reveal the process of calculating total sales and profit to determine salaries. You need to have a PlantUML viewer or use an online viewer to visualize the following code:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Manager" as manager
participant "Sales System" as sales
participant "Finance System" as finance
participant "Payroll System" as payroll

manager -> sales : Request total sales
activate sales
sales --> manager : Return total sales
deactivate sales

manager -> finance : Request total profit
activate finance
finance --> manager : Return total profit
deactivate finance

manager -> payroll : Calculate employee salaries based on sales & profit
activate payroll
payroll --> manager: Return calculated salaries
deactivate payroll

@enduml
```

Please replace the system names and process names based on your actual scenario. The code simply depicts that a manager requests total sales from a Sales System, then requests the total profit from a Finance System, and finally uses these figures to calculate employee salaries via a Payroll System.

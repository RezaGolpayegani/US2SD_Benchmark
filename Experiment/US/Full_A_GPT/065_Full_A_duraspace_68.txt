Sure, here is an example sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml 
participant "Repository Manager" as RM 
database "Data Repository" as DR
participant "Notification System" as NS

RM -> DR: Request information
activate DR 
DR -> DR: Retrieve language change log
DR --> RM: Return change log
deactivate DR 

RM -> NS: Request notifications on language changes
activate NS
NS --> RM: Confirm notification set up
deactivate NS
@enduml
```

Just replace "RM", "DR", and "NS" with the actual names or roles in your software system. In this case, the repository manager requests language change information from the data repository and also requests notifications on future language changes from the notification system.

Please note, this is a simplified version and the actual sequence would be more complicated involving several other systems/steps such as authentication, data processing, error handling etc. You can expand this based on your detailed requirement.

To visualize this, you can use any tool that supports PlantUML format or PlantUML online server.

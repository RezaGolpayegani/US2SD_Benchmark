Since it is not possible to create a detailed sequence diagram in text format answer, here is an example of sequence diagram in PlantUML format:
```
@startuml
participant "Trainee" as A
participant "Registration System" as B
participant "Authentication System" as C
participant "Database" as D

A -> B : Request register
activate B
B -> C : Check authentication
activate C
C -->> B : Return authentication status
deactivate C
B -> D : Check last registration date
activate D
D -->> B : Return last registration date
deactivate D
alt last registration date != today
    B --> A : Open registration form
    deactivate B 
    A -> B : Submit form
    activate B
    B -> D : Save new registration
    activate D
    D -->> B : Confirm registration save
    B --> A: Confirm registration
    deactivate B 
else no other action
    B --> A : Error - Already registered today
    deactivate B
end
@enduml
```
This example assumes you have a system responsible for registration and another system responsible for authentication. When a trainee (A) requests to register, the registration system (B) checks their authentication status with the authentication system (C). Afterwards, the system checks the database (D) for the last registration date. If the last registration date is not today, the trainee can register. Otherwise, an error message is sent.

Please note that, this diagram represents a very basic flow, does not include possible errors, exceptions or additional checks that could be necessary depending on your specific use case. Thus, you might need to adjust or extend it according to your needs.

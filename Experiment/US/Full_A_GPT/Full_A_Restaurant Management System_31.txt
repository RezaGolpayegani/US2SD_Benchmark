Sure, here is an example of how you can create your sequence diagram in Plant UML format. You need to represent the step-by-step interaction between a chef, system, and a service staff that happens in your user story. 

You can edit the actors, objects, and actions to better fit your individual scenario.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Chef
participant OrderSystem
actor ServiceStaff

Chef -> OrderSystem : Choose ordered items
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> OrderSystem : Retrieve selected items
OrderSystem -> Chef : Show selected items
deactivate OrderSystem
Chef -> OrderSystem : Set status as 'Can be served'
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> OrderSystem : Update item status
OrderSystem --> Chef : Confirm status update
deactivate OrderSystem
Chef -> OrderSystem : Notify staff
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> ServiceStaff : Show items ready to serve
deactivate OrderSystem

```

You can use any online sequence diagram tools such as PlantUML online server, draw.io, or others that support PlantUML text, to generate your diagram.

In this scenario, the chef selects the ordered items from the system, confirms the served status, and notifies the service staff. The system plays an important role in fetching and updating the item's status.

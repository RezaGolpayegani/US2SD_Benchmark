As an AI, I don't have the capabilities to generate UI-based images or sequence diagrams. However, I can provide you with a PlantUML sequence diagram code based on your requirements. All you have to do is paste the DSL into a PlantUML editor to generate the sequence diagram.

Please replace "Placeholder1", "Placeholder2", etc. with the actual processes in your system.

```PlantUML
@startuml

participant "FABS User" as A
participant "FABS System" as B
participant "Submission Error Handler" as C

A -> B: Submission Attempt
activate B
B -> C: Validates Submission
activate C
C --> B: Return Validation Result
deactivate C
B --> A: Return Submission Status
deactivate B

alt If Submission Error
  A -> B: Request Error Details
  activate B
  B -> C: Fetch Error Details
  activate C
  C --> B: Return Error Details
  deactivate C
  B --> A: Show Error Details
  
else If No Submission Error
  B --> A: Submission Successful
end

```

Remember to adjust this based on your actual system. This will display FABS user attempting to make a submission, the system validating the submission, and if errors are found, it will fetch and display the error details.

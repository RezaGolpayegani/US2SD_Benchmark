Sure, I can provide you an example of how the Plant UML format sequence diagram may look like. Due to text limitations, a detailed diagram is not possible. Here is a simplified sequence:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Librarian Views Member List

actor Librarian
participant LibrarySystem
database MemberDatabase

Librarian -> LibrarySystem: Request Member List
LibrarySystem -> MemberDatabase: Retrieve all Member data
MemberDatabase --> LibrarySystem: Return all Member data
LibrarySystem --> Librarian: Display Member List

@enduml
```

This describes the sequence where the `Librarian` actor requests a list of members from the `LibrarySystem` component. The system then retrieves all member data from the `MemberDatabase` component. Once the data is returned from the database, the system then displays the member list back to the librarian.

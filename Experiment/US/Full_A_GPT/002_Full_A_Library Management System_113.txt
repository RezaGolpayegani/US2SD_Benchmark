Sure, here is the sequence diagram in Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Manager" as A
participant "Book" as B
participant "Database" as C

A -> B : assignID()
activate B
B -> C : storeID()
activate C
C -->> B : IDStored()
deactivate C
B -->> A : IDAssigned()
deactivate B
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- Library Manager (A) initiates the sequence by assigning an ID to a Book (B).
- When the ID is assigned, the Book (B) becomes active.
- The Book then interacts with a Database (C) to store the ID.
- When the ID is stored successfully, the Database (C) sends back a confirmation message IDStored() to the Book (B).
- After receiving confirmation, the Book (B) sends a confirmation message IDAssigned() back to the Library Manager (A).

Make sure to replace `assignID(), storeID(), IDStored() and IDAssigned()` with actual function names which are used in your coding.

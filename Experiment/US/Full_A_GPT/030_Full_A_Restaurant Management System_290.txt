Here is an UML sequence diagram expressed in PlantUML code using your user story as a reference. 

```PlantUML
@startuml
"It's included\neither:\n<m1> actor</m1> or <m2> participant</m2>
  
actor Waiter
participant "Order Management \n System" as System

Waiter -> System: EnterOrderDetails()
activate System
System--> Waiter: ConfirmOrderDetails()
deactivate System
@enduml
```

This diagram outlines the process of a waiter entering order details into an order management system. The system then confirms the order details with the waiter. 

To view the diagram, you can copy this PlantUML code and paste into any UML diagram generator that supports PlantUML syntax (like www.planttext.com). 

You might need to adapt this base diagram to your specifics needs.

This diagram assumes that enter order details transaction does not require any argument which is unlikely in real situation. You may need more specific data like `EnterOrderDetails(OrderDetails)`. Also the diagram assumes that entering order details is an atomic transaction that either succeeds or fails as a whole, which might not be the case. More complex process may interact with other systems (like Inventory or Notification systems), may need multiple steps and may fail at every step. So, depending on your actual needs, you may want to refine this diagram.

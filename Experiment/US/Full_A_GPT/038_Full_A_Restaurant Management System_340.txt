Here's a simple sequence diagram in PlantUML format to get you started. Note that your exact implementation will need more specific details depending on your application structure and business rules:

```
@startuml
actor Employee

box "Order Management System" 
participant OrderEntryScreen
participant OrderSystem
participant Database
end box

Employee -> OrderEntryScreen : Go to order entry screen
activate OrderEntryScreen
OrderEntryScreen -> OrderSystem : Prompt for order search
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> OrderEntryScreen : Display order search form
deactivate OrderSystem
OrderEntryScreen -> Employee : Display order search form
deactivate OrderEntryScreen 
Employee -> OrderEntryScreen : Enter search parameters and submit
activate OrderEntryScreen
OrderEntryScreen -> OrderSystem : Send order search request
deactivate OrderEntryScreen
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> Database : Submit search query
activate Database
Database --> OrderSystem : Return search results
deactivate Database
OrderSystem -> OrderEntryScreen : Return search results to display
deactivate OrderSystem
Employee -> OrderEntryScreen : Select a specific order and click 'Add Note'
activate OrderEntryScreen
OrderEntryScreen -> OrderSystem : Send 'add note' request
deactivate OrderEntryScreen
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> OrderEntryScreen : Display note input form
deactivate OrderSystem
Employee -> OrderEntryScreen : Enter note details and submit
activate OrderEntryScreen
OrderEntryScreen -> OrderSystem : Send note details
deactivate OrderEntryScreen
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> Database : Save note to order
activate Database
Database --> OrderSystem : Confirm note has been saved
deactivate Database
OrderSystem -> OrderEntryScreen : Confirm note has been saved
deactivate OrderSystem
OrderEntryScreen -> Employee : Confirm note has been saved
deactivate OrderEntryScreen

This sequence diagram assumes there's an Order Management System, within which OrderEntryScreen is the UI interface that interacts with the Employee. Order system is the backend business logic part and Database is where the order and note data is stored.

The flow starts with Employee navigating to order entry screen, searching for an order, selecting it, adding a note, and getting a confirmation. More detailed controls, validations, error handling, etc would need to be added based on real scenarios.

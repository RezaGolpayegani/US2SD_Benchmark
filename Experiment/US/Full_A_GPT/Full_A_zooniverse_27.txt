This sequence diagram reflects the interaction of 4 entities:
1. Zooniverse Admin - the person who wishes to assess the said attributes of a picture.
2. Automated Analysis - the system in which the picture's automated analysis data are stored.
3. Annotations Database - a system where citizen annotations on pictures are held.
4. Comments Database - a system where user comments on 'Talk' are stored.

The process is as follows:
1. The Zooniverse Admin sends a request to Automated Analysis for the automated analysis data of a picture.
2. Automated Analysis returns the data once it finds it and becomes inactive.
3. Now, the Zooniverse Admin asks the Annotations Database for citizen annotations.
4. The Annotations Database retrieves the annotations and hands them over before deactivating.
5. Finally, the Zooniverse Admin requests the Comments Database for user comments on 'Talk'. It returns the comments and then deactivates.

Here is a sample PlantUML sequence diagram related to your user story:
```
@startuml
hide footbox

title Summit information

actor "Summit Coordinator" as SC
participant "Summit System" as SS

SC -> SS: Login
Activate SS
SS -> SC: Validate user credentials
SC -> SS: Enter summit info
SS -> SC: Validate summit info
deactivate SS

SC -> SS: Save summit info
Activate SS
SS --> SC: Confirm save
deactivate SS

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram shows the process of a Summit Coordinator logging into the Summit System, entering the summit information, the system validating the information and saving it, then finally confirming that the saving process was successful.

Below is a basic interpretation of your user story in the Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Data Publishing User" as user
participant "Python Client" as client
database "Datastore" as datastore

user -> client: input(data)
activate client
client ->client: process(data)
client -> datastore: addDataToStore(processedData)
datastore --> client: successMessage
client --> user: return(successMessage)
deactivate client
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram indicates the following steps:
1. The Data Publishing User starts an interaction by providing some data to the Python Client.
2. The Python Client processes the data.
3. After the data has been processed, the Python Client interfaces with the Datastore to add the processed data.
4. The Datastore communicates back to the Python Client with a success confirmation message.
5. Finally, the Python Client communicates the success back to the user.

It's important to note that there may be additional procedures involved, such as error checks, data validation, and data sanitization. This is a simplified version and may need to be adjusted following the specifics of your system and user story details.

Keep in mind that sequence diagrams should focus on the logic of the system and operations within. Actual code, like Python, is not part of it. It is a visual representation of the object-oriented software execution.

Also, sequence diagrams for bulk data could involve looping or asynchronous processes, not depicted in this basic scenario.

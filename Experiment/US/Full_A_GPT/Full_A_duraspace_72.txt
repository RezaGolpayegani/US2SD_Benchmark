Sure, this would be a simplified version of the sequence diagram based on your user's story. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "System" as S
database "Database" as DB

RM -> S: Input Name
S -> RM: Confirm Name
RM -> S: Input role (such as illustrator, photographer, etc.)
S -> RM: Confirm role
RM -> S: Save changes
S -> DB: Update information
DB --> S: Confirm update
S --> RM: Show update confirmation
@enduml
```

Here are the steps interpreted from the UML diagram above:

1. The Repository Manager inputs the Name
2. The System confirms the inputted Name
3. The Repository Manager provides the role(such as illustrator, photographer, etc.)
4. The System confirms the inputted role
5. The Repository Manager saves the changes
6. The System updates the database with the new information
7. The database confirms the update
8. The System shows an update confirmation to the Repository Manager

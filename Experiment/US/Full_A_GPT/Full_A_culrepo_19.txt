Sure, Here's a simple PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines this scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Library Statistics and Analytics Sequence Diagram

actor "Library Staff" as staff
control "Analytics System" as analytics
database "Repository" as repo
database "Collection" as collection
database "Author" as author
database "Item" as item

staff -> analytics : Request for Statistics
analytics -> repo : Get Repository Stats
activate repo
repo --> analytics : Return Repository Stats
deactivate repo

analytics -> collection : Get  Collection Stats
activate collection
collection --> analytics : Return Collection Stats
deactivate collection

analytics -> author : Get Author Stats
activate author
author --> analytics : Return Author Stats
deactivate author

analytics -> item : Get Item Stats
activate item
item --> analytics : Return Item Stats
deactivate item

analytics --> staff : Return Compiled Statistics
@enduml
```

This diagram represents these interactions: 

1) The Library Staff member requests for comprehensive statistics from the Analytics system.
2) The Analytics system retrieves stats from the Repository, Collection, Author, and Item databases.
3) The corresponding stats are returned to the Analytics system.
4) The Analytics system compiles and returns all the fetched statistics to the Library Staff member.

This is a simple sequence diagram and you should certainly customize it as per your requirements.

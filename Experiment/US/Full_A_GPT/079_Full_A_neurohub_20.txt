Sure, here is a simple detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format.

```
@startuml
participant "Supervisor" as S
participant "System" as Sys
participant "Database" as D

S -> Sys: Request researcher activities
activate Sys
Sys -> D: Get researcher activities
activate D
D -->> Sys: Return activities
deactivate D
Sys -->> S: Display activities
deactivate Sys
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes the following process:

1. The supervisor (`S`) requests to view the activities of their researchers from the system (`Sys`).
2. The system then sends a request to fetch these activities from the database (`D`).
3. After fetching the activities, the database returns this information to the system.
4. Finally, the system displays these activities to the supervisor.

Remember, the resulting diagram would be a graphical representation of this code, and you may need to adjust some details for your exact needs.

Here is your sequence diagram represented in PlantUML format for a DSpace integration:

```
@startuml

participant "Developer" as D
participant "Integration Tool" as IT
participant "DSpace" as DSpace

D -> IT : Request to integrate data
activate IT

IT -> DSpace : Establish connection
activate DSpace

DSpace --> IT : Confirm connection
deactivate DSpace

IT -> D : Send confirmation
deactivate IT

D -> IT:  Send data-packages

IT --> DSpace: Push data-packages
activate DSpace

DSpace --> IT: Receive data-packages
deactivate DSpace

IT --> D: Confirm Successful Data Transfer
deactivate IT

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram indicates the sequence in which these events occur:

1. The developer sends a request to integrate data to an integration tool.
2. The tool establishes a connection with DSpace.
3. DSpace confirms this connection to the integration tool.
4. The tool sends a confirmation of this successful connection to the developer.
5. The developer then sends data-packages to the integration tool.
6. The integration tool pushes these packages to DSpace.
7. DSpace then receives these data-packages.
8. The integration tool confirms the successful data transfer to the developer. 

Please replace "Integration Tool" with the actual tool's name you are using for this process. Also, please note that this is a high-level sequence diagram and real-life processes might require the consideration of fails, retries, and exception handling.

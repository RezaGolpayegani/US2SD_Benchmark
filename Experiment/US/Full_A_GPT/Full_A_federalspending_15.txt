Here is the sequence diagram you requested, written in Plant UML syntax:

```
@startuml
title Process USAspending Data

actor "System Owner" as owner
participant "USAspending" as usa
participant "Owner's System" as sys
participant "Grant Record Checker" as checker

owner -> sys : Choose USAspending as data source
sys -> usa : Request grant records
usa -> sys : Send all records
sys -> checker : Verify records
note over checker : Check if the record is related\n to grant funding
alt Grant Record
checker -> sys : Confirm grant records
sys -> owner : Send grant records
else Not Grant Record
checker -> sys : Reject non-grant records
sys -> owner : Information: Non-grant records rejected
end
@enduml
```

Please copy this syntax into a Plant UML editor to see the diagram it generates. This sequence diagram follows a flow where the system owner chooses USAspending as a data source, the system requests records from USAspending, USAspending sends all types of records, and the system verifies and rejects non-grant records, finally sending only grant records to the system owner.

Please note that a "Grant Record Checker" is used for the purpose of this diagram; it can be replaced or adjusted according to your actual system configuration.

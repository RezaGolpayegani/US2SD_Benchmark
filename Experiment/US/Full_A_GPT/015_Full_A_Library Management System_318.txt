Sure, here is a basic sequence diagram representing your user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Reader as r
participant "Book Review System" as brs

r -> brs: Clicks on book
activate brs
brs --> r: Shows book details with comment section
deactivate brs

r -> brs: Writes comment
activate brs
brs --> brs: Verify comment
brs -> brs: Store comment
brs --> r: Shows comment added message
deactivate brs
@enduml
```

This is a simple diagram, when the reader clicks on a book, the book review system activates and shows book details including a comment section. Then the reader writes a comment, this will then be verified and stored by the book review system. After the comment is stored, a message will be displayed to the reader stating the comment has been added.

Please note that this example is basic, the actual implementation might contain cleaner messages, error handling, user authentication etc.

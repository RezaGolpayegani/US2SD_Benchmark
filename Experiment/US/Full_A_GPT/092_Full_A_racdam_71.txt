Sure, here's an example of a sequence diagram for your user story using PlantUML format.

Please note that this example is just a general representation and should be adjusted according to the specifics and variables of your actual system and needs.

```
@startuml
title Cross-Collection Citation Information Sequence

actor Researcher
participant ResearchSystem
participant Database

Researcher -> ResearchSystem: RequestCitation(citationId)
ResearchSystem -> Database: QueryCitation(citationId)
Database --> ResearchSystem: ReturnCitationData(citationData)
ResearchSystem --> Researcher: DisplayCitationInformation(citationData)

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- The researcher requests citation information from the system.
- The system sends a query to the database using the citationId provided by the researcher.
- The database then returns the citation data to the system.
- The system then displays the citation information to the researcher. 

Please remember that this PlantUML does not cover all the features like error handling and user authentication, thus you might need to add more interactions for those and depending on your system design.

Sure, here's a simple example of the sequence diagram using PlantUML format. This code represents how the library manager interacts with the system when managing books' checkouts.

```
@startuml

actor "Library Manager" as LM

box "Library System" 
participant "Control System" as CS
participant "Database" as DB
end box

LM -> CS: Request Book Data
CS -> DB: Retrieve Book Data
DB --> CS: Return Book Data
CS --> LM: Display Book Data
note right of LM: Check Book Data
LM -> CS: Checkout Book
note over CS: Checkout Process
CS -> DB: Update Book Status
DB --> CS: Confirm Status Update
CS --> LM: Confirmation of Book Checkout

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the library manager requests book data from the control system, which then retrieves this data from the database. The control system displays the data to the manager, who checks and confirms checkout for a book. The checkout process updates the book status in the database, and the database confirms the successful status update. Lastly, the control system provides the confirmation of book checkout to the library manager.

Please adjust according to your specific user story and system requirements.

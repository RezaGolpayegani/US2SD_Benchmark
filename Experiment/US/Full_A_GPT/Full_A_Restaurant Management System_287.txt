Sure, here is a simple sequence diagram that describes the interaction between the waiter (actor), restaurant system (system), and the customer (actor) in a Plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Waiter
boundary "Restaurant System" as System
actor Customer

                Waiter -> System : Request to Display Menu
                activate Waiter
                activate System
                
                System --> Waiter : Returns Menu
                deactivate System
                
                Waiter -> Customer: Shows Menu
                activate Customer
                
                Customer --> Waiter: Gives Order
                deactivate Waiter

Above sequence diagram is implemented using PlantUML syntax where the waiter asks the restaurant system to display the menu items. The system returns the menu to the waiter, who then shows it to the customer. Then, the customer gives the order.

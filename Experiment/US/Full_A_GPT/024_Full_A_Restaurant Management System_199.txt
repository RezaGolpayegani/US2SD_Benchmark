Here's a simple way how you might represent this story in a Sequence Diagram format using Plant UML:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Number of Orders Taken by Each Waiter Daily

actor Manager
entity "Tracking System" as TS
database "Order Database"  as DB

Manager -> TS : Request waiter's daily orders
activate TS
TS -> DB : Retrieve daily order
activate DB
DB -->> TS : Returns Order data
deactivate DB
TS -->> Manager: Display number of orders
deactivate TS

@enduml
```

In this Sequence Diagram, the Manager triggers the Tracking System to request waiter's daily orders. The System then contacts the Order Database to retrieve the relevant data. The data is returned from the Database to the System, which then displays this information to the Manager. 

Note: To be able to see the sequence diagram from the above PlantUML code, you will need to copy the code into a PlantUML editor or PlantUML online tool. Such editors will render the image of the sequence diagram based on the PlantUML code.

A specific textual representation for a sequence diagram in Plant UML format would look like this:

```PlantUML
@startuml
title ALFRED Navigation for Older Person

actor OlderPerson
participant "ALFRED" as A
participant "Navigation System" as NS

OlderPerson -> A: Activate ALFRED
activate A
A --> OlderPerson: Acknowledge Activation

OlderPerson -> A: Request Direction
activate A
A -> NS: Seek Direction
activate NS
NS --> A: Give Direction
deactivate NS
A --> OlderPerson: Provide Direction
deactivate A
@enduml
```

Explanation:

- The actor `OlderPerson` starts by activating `ALFRED`.
- `ALFRED` acknowledges activation back to `OlderPerson`.
- Then `OlderPerson` requests direction from `ALFRED`.
- `ALFRED` seeks direction from the `Navigation System`.
- The `Navigation System` gives direction to `ALFRED`.
- Finally, `ALFRED` provides the direction to `OlderPerson`.

NOTE: This sequence diagram is kept simple for ease of understanding. Depending on the specific requirements, additions are likely in a more complex, real-world scenario (e.g., handling errors in case the Navigation System fails, confirming the direction from OlderPerson, etc.).

Below is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
title Consumer View Publisher Profile Sequence Diagram

autonumber
actor Consumer
participant "WebsiteApp" as App
participant "Database" as DB

Consumer -> App: Request Publisher Profile
App -> DB: Fetch Publisher Profile
DB --> App: Return Publisher Profile
App --> Consumer: Display Publisher Profile

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram starts with a Consumer who requests the Publisher's profile from the WebsiteApp. The WebsiteApp fetches the necessary Publisher Profile data from the Database. The Database returns the publisher profile data to the WebsiteApp, which then displays the Publisher Profile to the Consumer. 

Please note, you should run this code in any PlantUML environment in order to draw the sequence diagram.

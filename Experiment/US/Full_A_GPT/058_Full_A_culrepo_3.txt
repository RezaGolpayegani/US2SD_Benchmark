Sure, below is an example of a sequence diagram using PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Faculty Data and Publication Upload 
Actor Faculty 
boundary "University Repository System" as Repository 
database "Publication Database" as Database 

Faculty -> Repository : Request Access
activate Repository
Repository --> Faculty : Provide Access
deactivate Repository
activate Faculty
Faculty -> Repository : Start Upload Process
activate Repository
Repository --> Faculty : Request Data and Publication Details
Faculty --> Repository : Sends Data and Publication Details
Repository -> Database : Verify Publication 
activate Database
Database --> Repository : Verification Results
deactivate Database
alt Publication Verified
    Repository --> Faculty : Upload Successful, Provides Attribution Link
else Publication Not Verified
    Repository --> Faculty : Upload Failed - Retry
end
deactivate Repository
@enduml
```

In this diagram, the faculty member initiates the upload process by requesting access from the university repository system. The repository provides access and the faculty begins the upload process. The repository requests for the data and publication details which are sent by the faculty. The repository then verifies the supplied publication details with the publication database. Depending on the verification result, a success or failure notice is sent to faculty member. 

Note that you will need a PlantUML viewer or compiler to visualize the sequence diagram.

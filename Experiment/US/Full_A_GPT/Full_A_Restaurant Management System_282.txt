Sure, this is an example of how you may create such sequence diagram in PlantUML:

```
@startuml
participant "Waiter" as W
participant "Order Management System" as OMS

W -> OMS : Select Order to Modify
note right : Waiter selects an incorrect order item to deselect.

OMS -> OMS : Fetch Order Details
note right : System fetches all items involved in the selected order.

OMS -> W : Display Order Details
note right : System displays all the items involved in the selected order.

W -> OMS : Deselect Order Item
note right : Waiter deselects an incorrect order item.

OMS -> OMS : Update Order Details
note right : System updates the order removing the deselected item.

OMS -> W : Display Updated Order
note right : System displays the updated order.

```

This code when run through a PlantUML processor would yield a sequence diagram of interactions between the waiter (W) and the order management system (OMS).

Please replace the descriptions with the actual processes as per your application context.

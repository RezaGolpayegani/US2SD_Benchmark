Sure, here is a simple example of a sequence diagram in PlantUML language for your user story:

```
@startuml
actor Librarian
entity "Library System" as LS
database "Books Database" as BD

Librarian -> LS: Request expired books
activate LS
LS -> BD: Fetch expired books details
activate BD
BD --> LS: Return book details
deactivate BD
LS --> Librarian: Display expired books
deactivate LS
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the Librarian requests the expired books details from the Library System. The Library System fetches the details from the Books Database and then returns the book details to the Librarian. Precise modifications might be needed according to the actual system model.

Note: You'll need a PlantUML viewer or server to visualize this diagram and replace the dummy method with the actual method name that your system used.

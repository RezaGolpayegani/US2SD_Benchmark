Below is a sequence diagram written in PlantUML syntax. 

Please note that PlantUML language cannot be properly represented here due to formatting restrictions. Therefore, for better visualization, you should paste the following code into a PlantUML compiler. Then, you will see a graphical representation of the sequence diagram.

```
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant InventorySystem as IS
participant Database as DB

M -> IS : Request Missing Books
activate IS
IS -> DB : Query Missing Book Numbers
activate DB
DB -->> IS : Return Missing Book Numbers
deactivate DB
IS -->> M : Show Missing Book Numbers
deactivate IS
@enduml
```

Trait Description:
1. The Manager (M) sends a request to see missing book numbers to the Inventory System (IS).
2. The Inventory System makes a query to the Database (DB) to get the missing book numbers.
3. The Database returns the missing book numbers to the Inventory System.
4. The Inventory System then shows the missing book numbers to the Manager.

Each of this steps will take place in sequence, reflecting the interactions between different components in the system to fulfil the Manager's request.

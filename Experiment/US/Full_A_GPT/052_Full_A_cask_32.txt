Sure, here is an example of a detailed sequence diagram using Plant UML that relates to your user story. Please note that you will need to adapt this to your own project:

```
@startuml
actor Developer

Developer --> System: Calls CreateCustomDatasetType()
activate System
System --> Dataset: Create custom dataset
activate Dataset
Dataset --> System: Returns dataset id
deactivate Dataset
System --> Developer: Returns dataset id
deactivate System

Developer --> System: Calls DeployDatasetType(dataset_id)
activate System
System --> App: Deploy dataset type inside app
activate App
App --> System: Returns acknowledgment
deactivate App
System --> Developer: Returns acknowledgment
deactivate System

Developer --> System: Calls UseCustomDatasetTypeInPlugin(dataset_id)
activate System
System --> Plugin: Pass the custom dataset type
activate Plugin
Plugin --> System: Returns acknowledgment
deactivate Plugin
System --> Developer: Returns acknowledgment
deactivate System
@enduml
```  

This sequence diagram includes actions such as creating a custom dataset type, deploying it smoothly, and using the custom dataset type within a plugin. The actions take place between the Developer, the System, a Dataset, an App, and a Plugin.

Please use an appropriate UML diagram editor to execute the code and to see the drawn sequence diagram. Adjust it to align appropriately with your code and the specific methods or endpoints you are using.

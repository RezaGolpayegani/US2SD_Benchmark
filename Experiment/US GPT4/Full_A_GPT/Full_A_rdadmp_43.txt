Here is an example of a sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "Data Management System" as DMS
actor DataStakeholders

RM -> DMS : Request Data Details
activate DMS
DMS -> DataStakeholders : Validate Access 
activate DataStakeholders
DataStakeholders --> DMS : Access Permission
deactivate DataStakeholders
DMS -> DMS : Fetch Data Types
DMS --> RM: Return Data Details
deactivate DMS
RM -> RM: Check Archiving Arrangement
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram describes how the repository manager interacts with the data management system and other data stakeholders. The repository manager initiates a request for data details to the data management system. The system validates the request by checking access permission with the data stakeholders. Once the access permission is granted, the system fetches the required information about the type of data. The details are then returned to the repository manager, who can then check if the archiving can be arranged.

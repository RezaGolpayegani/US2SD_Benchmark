As an AI model, I can help generate elements of a PlantUML sequence diagram based on the user story. However, you will need to visualize the diagram manually as I can't provide images directly. Here's the sequence you might expect:

```plantuml
@startuml
"Plugin Developer" -> "Software": Request dataset type
activate "Software"
"Software" -> "Dataset Management System": Check dataset type availability
activate "Dataset Management System"
note right: Software checks \nwhether the type is deployed\n by an app or independently
"Dataset Management System" -> "Dataset Management System": Verify dataset type
"Dataset Management System" --> "Software": Return dataset type/ Not-found 
"Software" --> "Plugin Developer": Provide dataset type/ error message
deactivate "Software"
note right: Plugin Developer infuse the\n dataset type into the plugin
"Plugin Developer" -> "Plugin": Include dataset type
activate "Plugin"
note right: Developer upgrade the\n dataset if required
"Plugin Developer" -> "Plugin": Upgrade dataset (if required)
"Plugin Developer" -> "Software": Deploy plugin with new dataset type/version
activate "Software"
"Software" -> "Deployment System": Deploy updated plugin
activate "Deployment System"
"Deployment System" --> "Software": Confirmation of successful deployment
"Software" --> "Plugin Developer": Provide deployment success/error message
deactivate "Software"

```

This diagram assumes that the software communicates with a Dataset Management System to check and verify the dataset type. The plugin developer then includes this type into a plugin, potentially upgrading the dataset. Finally, the developer deploys the plugin via the software, which communicates with the Deployment System. The confirmation of deployment is then relayed back to the plugin developer.

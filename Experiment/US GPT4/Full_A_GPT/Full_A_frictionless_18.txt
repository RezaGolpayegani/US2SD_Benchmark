Based on the provided user story, the sequence diagram Plant UML format might look as follows:

```plantuml
title "Get Data Package into Clojure"

actor Developer

entity "Data Management Tool" as DMT

database "Data Package Repository" as DPR

Developer -> DMT: Request(DataPackage)

DMT -> DPR: Request(DataPackage)

DPR --> DMT: Response (DataPackage)

DMT --> Developer: Response (DataPackage)

Developer -> DMT: ImportDataToClojure(DataPackage)

DMT -> DPR: ImportRequest(DataPackage, Language=Clojure)

DPR --> DMT: ImportResponse (DataPackage, Success)

DMT --> Developer: ImportResponse (DataPackage, Success)
```
This diagram illustrates how a developer requests a data package from the Data Management Tool, which in turn requests the data package from the data package repository. Once the data package is retrieved, it is returned to the developer. The developer then requests the data package to be imported to Clojure. The Data Management Tool sends an import request to the Data Package Repository, specifying the desired programming language (Clojure in this case). After the data is successfully imported to Clojure, a response is sent to the developer. 

Please note that this is a basic flow and might change depending on the specific application and requirements within the actual system.

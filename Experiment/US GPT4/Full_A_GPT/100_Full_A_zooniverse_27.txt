In order to generate a detailed Sequence Diagram for the provided user story, several interactions between the objects need to be mapped out, which are detailed below:

1. User ("Zooniverse admin") requests the automated analysis of an image.
2. The system ("Admin Panel") triggers the Image Analysis Module which then performs the automated analysis on the chosen image.
3. The result of the automated analysis is then sent back to the system.
4. The system then requests the Citizen Annotations Module to fetch the citizen annotations for the chosen image.
5. The Citizen Annotations Module fetches the required annotations and sends them back to the system.
6. The system then requests the Comment Module to fetch the comments on the image from Talk.
7. The Comment Module fetches the required comments and sends them back to the system.
8. The system takes all three sets of data (automated analysis, citizen annotations, and comments) and processes them together to assess how interesting, appealing, or complex the image is.
9. The system presents the result to the user ("Zooniverse admin").

The aforementioned interactions, formatted in PlantUML, are as follows:

```
@startuml

autonumber
actor Admin as "Zooniverse admin"
participant AdminPanel as "System (Admin Panel)"
participant ImageAnalysis as "Image Analysis Module"
participant CitizenAnnotations as "Citizen Annotations Module"
participant Comments as "Comment Module"

Admin -> AdminPanel : Request Automated Analysis of Image
AdminPanel -> ImageAnalysis : Trigger Automated Analysis
ImageAnalysis --> AdminPanel : Return Automated Analysis

AdminPanel -> CitizenAnnotations : Fetch Citizen Annotations
CitizenAnnotations --> AdminPanel : Return Citizen Annotations

AdminPanel -> Comments : Fetch Comments from Talk
Comments --> AdminPanel : Return Comments

AdminPanel -> AdminPanel : Process Data
AdminPanel --> Admin : Return Assessment

This script should generate the desired sequence diagram in visual representation.

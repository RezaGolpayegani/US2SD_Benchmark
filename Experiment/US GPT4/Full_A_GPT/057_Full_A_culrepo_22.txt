Sequence Diagram for the User Story in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml

actor "DB/IR Administrator" as admin
entity "Repository System" as system
database "Subscriber Database" as database

admin -> system : Request list of subscribers for specified report
activate system
system -> database : Query subscribers for specified report
activate database
database -->> system : Return list of subscribers
deactivate database
system -->> admin : Display list of subscribers
deactivate system

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram: 

- The DB/IR Administrator (represented as "admin") makes a request to the Repository System (represented as "system") to see the list of subscribers for a specified report.
- The system takes this request and queries from the Subscriber Database (represented as "database") for the subscribers of the specified report.
- The database returns the list of subscribers to the system.
- The system then displays this list of subscribers to the DB/IR Administrator.

As per this sequence diagram, the DB/IR Administrator interacts only with the Repository System, not directly with the Subscriber Database. The Repository System acts as the interface for the DB/IR Administrator to interact with the Subscriber Database.

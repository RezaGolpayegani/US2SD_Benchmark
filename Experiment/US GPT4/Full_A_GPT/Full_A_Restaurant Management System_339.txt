Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to draw diagrams. Nonetheless, I can explain how to create a sequence diagram for the user story in Plant UML format. 

```plantuml
@startuml
title Enter Customer Reviews Sequence Diagram

actor Employee
participant System
database ReviewDb

Employee -> System : Login()
alt Success
    System --> Employee: Show Dashboard options
    Employee -> System : Add Review Option()
    System --> Employee: Request Customer Consent
    Employee -> System : Add Consent Confirmation()
    System --> Employee: Request Review Details
    Employee -> System : Add Review Details()
    System -> ReviewDb: SaveReview()
    ReviewDb --> System: Confirm Save Review
    System --> Employee: Confirm Save Review
else Failure
    System --> Employee: Show Error Login 
end

The diagram starts with the `Actor` as the Employee. Employee logs into the System and the System shows the dashboard options. There's a condition here, if the login is a success, system displays the dashboard else sends an error. 

On login success, Employee chooses the Option to `Add Review`. The System asks for customer's consent. On receiving consent confirmation, System requests for review details. Employee adds the review details, and the System saves these details to `ReviewDb`. On successful save, System gives confirmation back to Employee.

Below is a simple PlantUML code to represent the process of a Consumer viewing a Publisher's profile. Please note that this example is simplified and you may need to expand or adjust it to suit your project's specific needs.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Consumer" as C
participant "Platform Server" as P
participant "Database" as D

C -> P: Request to view Publisher's profile
activate P
P -> D : Fetch Publisher's profile data
activate D
D --> P : Return Publisher's profile data
deactivate D
P --> C : Display Publisher's profile
deactivate P
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The Consumer makes a request to view the Publisher's profile.
2. This request is processed by the Platform server.
3. The Platform server then retrieves the required data from the Database.
4. The Database sends the requested data back to the Platform server.
5. Finally, the Platform server displays the Publisher's profile to the Consumer.

Please adjust the diagram to fit into your application design perspective. This is a basic design that can be extended according to the functionality of your system.

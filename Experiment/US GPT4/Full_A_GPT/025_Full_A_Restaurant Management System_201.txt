Here is a detailed sequence diagram in the Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Software" as MS
participant "Inventory Database" as DB

Manager -> MS : Request remaining items
activate MS
MS -> DB : Retrieve remaining items
activate DB
DB -->> MS : Returns remaining items
deactivate DB
MS --> Manager : Show remaining items
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram defines when a manager wants to see the remaining items on the restaurant inventory list. The interaction begins with the manager sending a request to the management software to see the remaining items. The software then sends a message to fetch this information from the inventory database. The database returns the remaining items back to the software, and the software finally displays this information back to the manager.

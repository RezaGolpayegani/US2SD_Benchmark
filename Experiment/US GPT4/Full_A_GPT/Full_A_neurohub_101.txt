Here's a sequence diagram description in PlantUML syntax for the given user story, "As a researcher, I want to have a group-level repository for sharing papers/reviews/comments with other researchers."

This Situation assumes that there exists a User class, a GroupRespository class and a Repository class.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "User" as user
participant "GroupRepository" as groupRepository
participant "Repository" as repository
user -> groupRepository : createGroupRepository("ResearchGroup")
groupRepository -> groupRepository : handleGroupCreation()
activate groupRepository
groupRepository --> user : repositoryID
deactivate groupRepository
user -> groupRepository : addMember("User2")
groupRepository -> groupRepository : handleAddMember()
activate groupRepository
groupRepository --> user : memberId
deactivate groupRepository
user -> repository : uploadFile("researchPaper.pdf")
activate repository
repository -> repository : handleUpload()
repository --> user : uploadConfirmation
deactivate repository
user -> repository : shareFile("researchPaper.pdf", repositoryID, memberId)
activate repository
repository -> repository : handleShare()
repository --> user : shareConfirmation
deactivate repository
@enduml
```

This diagram description assumes that the researcher creates a group repository and then invites another user to the repository. The researcher then uploads a file to the repository and shares it with the other member. Expectations of the sequence of actions are represented via the methods handleGroupCreation(), handleAddMember(), handleUpload(), and handleShare() in the corresponding classes.

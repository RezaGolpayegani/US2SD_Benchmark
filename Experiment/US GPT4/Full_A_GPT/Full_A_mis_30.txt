As an AI, I'm unable to directly create images or diagrams. However, I can guide you to draft the PlantUML format for the sequence diagram.

Here's how you could write it:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Granting Embargo Privileges

actor DigitalRecordsArchivist as DRA
participant RepositoryManagementSystem as RMS
participant RepositoryAdministrator as Admin

DRA -> RMS: Request Admin List 
activate RMS
RMS --> DRA: Show Admin List
deactivate RMS
DRA -> RMS: Choose Administrator
activate RMS
RMS --> DRA: Load Administrator Profile
deactivate RMS
DRA -> RMS: Grant Embargo Privileges
activate RMS
RMS --> DRA: Confirm Privileges Granted
deactivate RMS
RMS -> Admin: Notify Embassy Privileges Granted
activate Admin
deactivate Admin

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram outlines the process where:

1. DigitalRecordsArchivist requests the list of administrators from the RepositoryManagementSystem.
2. The system returns the list.
3. DigitalRecordsArchivist chooses an Administrator.
4. The system loads that administrator's profile. 
5. DigitalRecordsArchivist grants the embargo privileges to that administrator.
6. The system confirms that the privileges have been granted.
7. The system then notifies the RepositoryAdministrator about their newfound privileges. 

You can copy this PlantUML code into any PlantUML editor or IDE plugin that supports it to generate your sequence diagram. Please note, the sequence of interactions may need to be adjusted depending on the actual functionality and workflow/routing of the system.

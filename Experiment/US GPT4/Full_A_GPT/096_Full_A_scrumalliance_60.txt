Here is a PlantUML sequence diagram in text format to represent the user story:

```
@startuml
actor Visitor
entity "Site" as site

Visitor -> site: Start
site -> site: Load Homepage
site -> Visitor: Display Homepage
Visitor -> site : Clicks on an article
note right: Visitor can read \narticles without signing-in
site -> site: Load selected article
site -> Visitor: Display article
Visitor -> Visitor: Read the article
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram explains the steps that a site visitor would take to read some articles without first joining the site:

1. A site visitor starts,
2. The site loads the homepage,
3. The visitor is presented with the homepage.
4. The visitor clicks to select an article,
5. The site loads the selected article,
6. The visitor is then presented the article,
7. Visitor starts to read the article.

Please note that, this description will have to be converted into a PlantUML format to visualize it. Once that is done, you'll have a visual sequence diagram representation of the user story.

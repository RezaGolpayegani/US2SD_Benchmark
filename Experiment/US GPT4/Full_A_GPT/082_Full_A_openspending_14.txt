Because sequence diagrams in PlantUML are quite complex and involve ASCII characters, here is the text-based sequence diagram for this user story.

```
@startuml

actor "Data Publishing User" as User

This simple sequence of interaction starts with the Data Publishing User logging into the platform. They navigate to the dataset they wish to enhance, and select the option to provide additional GeoJSON sources. The platform then presents an upload form that the user uses to upload their GeoJSON source. Once uploaded, the Platform Administrator is notified, reviews the source, and then approves it. The user is then notified of this approval, after which they log out.

I'm an AI language model developed by OpenAI and I can't directly create diagrams. But, I can certainly provide you with the textual representation which you can convert into a sequence diagram using PlantUML yourself. Based on your user story, here is an abstract representation:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Update Book Pages Information 

actor Librarian
boundary UserInterface
control BookManagementService
entity BookDatabase

Librarian -> UserInterface : Navigate to Update Book Page
UserInterface -> BookManagementService : Request Book Info
BookManagementService -> BookDatabase : Fetch Book Info
BookDatabase -> BookManagementService : Returns Book Info
BookManagementService -> UserInterface : Show Book Info
UserInterface --> Librarian : Display Book Info

Librarian -> UserInterface : Enter New Page Number
UserInterface -> BookManagementService : Update Book Info Request
BookManagementService -> BookDatabase : Update Page Number in Record
BookDatabase -> BookManagementService : Confirm Page Number Update
BookManagementService -> UserInterface : Confirm Update
UserInterface --> Librarian : Show Update Confirmation

@enduml
```

In this abstract representation:

- The Librarian interacts with the UserInterface to Update Book Page.
- A BookManagementService mediates between the UserInterface and the backend BookDatabase.
- The sequence begins when the Librarian navigates to the update book page on the UserInterface.
- The BookManagementService fetches the current book information from the BookDatabase, which returns the information to the UserInterface, where it is displayed to the Librarian.
- The Librarian then inputs the new page number into the UserInterface and confirms the update.
- The BookManagementService processes the update in the BookDatabase, which then sends a confirmation of the update back up the chain to the Librarian.

Note that this is an abstracted version and the real implementation may contain more details based on business requirements and technical design.

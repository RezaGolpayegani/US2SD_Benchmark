Generating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format based on text inputs is not possible for an AI model yet since it requires conceptual understanding and interpretation of requirements to create a visual flow. However, based on your project description, here is a basic pseudo-code that explains how the sequence might look for the user story:

```
@startuml
User -> Data Management Platform: Request File F
Data Management Platform -> Data Processing: Check File F Format
Data Processing --> Data Management Platform: Confirm File F Format
Data Management Platform --> User: Provide File F in Correct Format
@enduml
```

Please note that this is a very general example and might need to be fine-tuned or expanded depending on the exact flow of interactions within your platform and how File F is processed and delivered.

Given that generating diagrams through text is not currently feasible, we can provide a sequence in UML code format using PlantUML syntax to represent the User Story scenario:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor "Data Publishing User" as user
participant "Python Client" as client
participant "Datastore" as datastore

user -> client: Invoke client with bulk data
client -> datastore: Send bulk data request
datastore -> datastore: Validate bulk data request 
datastore --> client: Return acknowledgment of request
client --> user: Confirm successful data submission
@enduml
```

In the representation, the Python Client is invoked by the Data Publishing User with the desired data to be uploaded in bulk. The bulk data upload request is sent to the Datastore, which validates the request. If the data is valid, the Datastore sends an acknowledgment of the request back to the Python Client. The Python Client then confirms the successful data submission to the User, completing the sequence. 

This is a simplified example and actual implementation could have more steps involved, such as error checking, data validation and preprocessing, etc.

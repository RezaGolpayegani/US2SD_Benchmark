Below is a potential PlantUML code for a simple sequence diagram for a manager viewing the customer satisfaction ratio. This diagram involves a manager, web application and database system.

```
@startuml
actor Manager as m

box "Web Application" 
    participant "Dashboard" as d 
    participant "Data Analyzer" as a
end box 

database "Database" as db

m -> d : Input request to view customer satisfaction ratio
activate d
d -> a : Forward request
deactivate d
activate a
a -> db : Query for customer reviews data
activate db
a <-- db : Return customer reviews data
deactivate db
a -> a : Calculate customer satisfaction ratio
a --> d : Return ratio report
deactivate a
activate d
m <-- d : Display ratio report
deactivate d

```

This is a simple sequence diagram which displays the interaction between the manager, the web application, and the database. The manager inputs a request to view the customer satisfaction ratio, this request is forwarded to the Data Analyzer by the Dashboard. The Data Analyzer then queries the customer reviews data from the database. Once it receives this data, it's used to calculate the customer satisfaction ratio, which gets returned to the Dashboard and eventually displayed to the manager. 

Please note that actual interactions may vary depending on specific system design and requirements.

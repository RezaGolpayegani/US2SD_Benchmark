I'm an AI model, so I can't generate diagrams or images directly. However, I can definitely help you to craft the code to create the required sequence diagram in Plant UML. Please, rewrite the code in your text editor and execute it:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Waiter" as W
participant "Restaurant Management System" as RMS
participant "Database" as DB

W -> RMS : Sends request to update waiting time
activate RMS
RMS -> DB : Sends query to update waiting time
activate DB
DB --> RMS : Returns acknowledgement message
deactivate DB
RMS --> W : Sends update status
deactivate RMS
@enduml
```

This is the scenario when a waiter wants to update the waiting time of a table. Here the waiter sends a request to the restaurant management system, which in turn will send a query to the system's database to get the desired update. After the database has made the requested changes, it sends an acknowledgement message to the restaurant management system, which finally forwards the update status to the waiter.

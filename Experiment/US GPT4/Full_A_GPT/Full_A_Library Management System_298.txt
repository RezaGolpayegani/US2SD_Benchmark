As a text-based AI, I can not draw diagrams but I can explain how the UML sequence diagram would look for the mentioned user story in textual format.

The sequence diagram would include the following components: Member, Library Management System (LMS), and the Book Inventory.

Here is a simple PlantUML code depicting the interaction.

```puml
@startuml
title Member Views Book Due Date 

Actor Member
entity "Library Management system" as LMS
database "Book Inventory" as BI

Member -> LMS : Search for book
LMS -> BI : Query Book status
BI --> LMS : Return Book status and due date
LMS --> Member : Display Book status and due date

@enduml
```
Explanation:

1. The "Member" sends a message to the "Library Management System" (LMS) to search for a specific book.

2. Then, LMS sends a message to the "Book Inventory" (BI) to query the status of the book (whether it's borrowed or not) and its due date.

3. The "Book Inventory" returns the book status and due date to the LMS.

4. Finally, the "Library Management System" displays the book status and due date to the "Member".

This is a simplified description and the actual system may involve more complexity depending on other factors like authentication, etc.

Here is a PlantUML code for a Sequence Diagram based on the User Story "As a library member, I want to order books according to title."

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Library_Member
entity Library_System
database Books_Database

Library_Member -> Library_System : Request_All_Books
activate Library_System
Library_System -> Books_Database : Retrieve_All_Books
activate Books_Database
Books_Database --> Library_System : Books_List
deactivate Books_Database
Library_System --> Library_Member : Display_Books_List
deactivate Library_System

Library_Member -> Library_System : Order_By_Title
activate Library_System
Library_System -> Books_Database : Order_Books_By_Title
activate Books_Database
Books_Database --> Library_System : Ordered_Books_List
deactivate Books_Database
Library_System --> Library_Member : Display_Ordered_Books
deactivate Library_System
@enduml
```

Please note that this is a basic sample and the actual system may involve more entities and more complexity. This User Story assumes that the user sends a request to the library system to retrieve all books, then requests them to be ordered by title. The library system then interacts with the books database to execute these tasks and then returns the results to the library member.

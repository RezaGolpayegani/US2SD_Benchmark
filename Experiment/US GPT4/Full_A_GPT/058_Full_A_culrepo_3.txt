This sequence diagram describes the flow of the interaction between the faculty member and repository system when a faculty member wants to upload a data to repository and associate it with a publication. 

1. The faculty member logs into the system.
2. If the login is successful, the faculty member navigates to the data upload page. 
3. The repository system shows a form for uploading data. 
4. The faculty member fills out the form and uploads the file. 
5. The repository system asks for confirmation of the upload. 
6. The faculty member confirms the upload, and the repository system confirms that the data has been successfully uploaded.
7. The faculty member then navigates to the associated publication.
8. The repository system shows the details of the publication.
9. The faculty member requests to attach the uploaded data to the publication.
10. The repository system asks for confirmation of this operation.
11. The faculty member confirms the association of the data to the publication, and the repository system confirms that the association has been made.

If the login is not successful, the repository system denies access to the faculty member.

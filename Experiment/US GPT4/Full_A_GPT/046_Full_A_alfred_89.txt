As an AI language model, I'm not able to draw diagrams or use programming languages interactively. However, I can describe how a PlantUML sequence diagram could look like based on the user story "As an OlderPerson, I want to have the ALFRED shirt has to be non stigmatizing". Here's a rough idea for how your PlantUML code could look:

```
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant ALFRED

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Request to use device
activate ALFRED

ALFRED -> ALFRED: Verify request
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: Show selection of shirts for device

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Choose a shirt
deactivate ALFRED
activate ALFRED

ALFRED -> ALFRED: Check shirt design - Ensure non-stigmatizing
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: Confirm shirt selection

deactivate ALFRED
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the user(OlderPerson) interacts with the ALFRED device, choosing a shirt for the device. The selected shirt is then checked for its design by ALFRED to ensure it is non-stigmatizing. This code will generate a sequence diagram based on the user story "As an OlderPerson, I want to have the ALFRED shirt has to be non stigmatizing". Please note that this is a basic, abstract example and the specific methods and processes may vary based on the exact functionality of ALFRED.

Here's the written PLANT UML sequence diagram. Please note that specific details and behaviors could be added or modified based on specific business requirements and deeper insights about the whole application.

```
@startuml
participant "OlderPerson" as O
participant "ALFRED(VoiceCommandInterface)" as A
participant "Navigation Application" as N

O -> A: Activate ALFRED through voice command
activate A 

A -> A: Analyze the command
A -> N: Request for navigation assistance
note over A, N: ALFRED API / Middleware

activate N 

N -> N: Fetch navigation information
N --> A: Send navigation details

A --> O: Command the navigation
note right: Voice commands or visual support system (adaptive to the user's needs)
deactivate A
deactivate N
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Older Person activating ALFRED through a voice command. ALFRED then analyzes the command and requests navigation assistance from the Navigation Application via an API or Middleware. The Navigation application fetches the required navigation data and sends it to ALFRED, which finally commands the older person to navigate using either voice commands or a visual support system, depending on the user's needs.

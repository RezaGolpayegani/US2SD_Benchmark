I am an AI and not capable of creating visual diagrams, but I can provide you with the framework of how a sequence diagram would look for the given user story in PlantUML syntax.

The sequence diagram will show the interaction of the older person and the ALFRED system.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber

actor OlderPerson as "Older Person"
participant "ALFRED" as A

"Older Person" -> A : Ask for tips
activate A
A -> "HealthcareProvider" as HP : Request health tips
activate HP
HP --> A : Return health tips
deactivate HP
A --> "Older Person" : Provide health tips
deactivate A

@enduml
```

This indicates that the older person (User) will ask the ALFRED system for advice on how to reduce their health impairments without medication. The ALFRED system will then communicate with the healthcare providers to gather this advice, and once received, will return it to the older person. 

Please note this is a basic diagram and interactions might get more complex based on the functions present in the applications. For example, notifications or reminder node might be added if ALFRED schedules reminders for tips it provided.

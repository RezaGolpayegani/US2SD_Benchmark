Since generating diagrams in text is quite tricky, here is a Plant UML Sequence Diagram depicted in text. You'd need to enter this code in a Plant UML environment to actually see the resulting diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Developer" as A
participant "Data Management Tool" as B
participant "DSpace Integration Module" as C
participant "DSpace" as D

A -> B : Request for data packaging
activate B
B -> C : Calls DSpace Integration Module
activate C
C -> D : Establish connection
activate D
note over D : Connection Established
D --> C : Sends confirmation
deactivate D
C --> A : Returns packaged data
deactivate C
note over A : Uses packaged data \nwith pipelines that use DSpace
deactivate B
@enduml
```

This diagram basically outlines how a developer interacts with a data management tool to package data and then link it with pipelines that use DSpace. 

It starts with a request from the developer to the data management tool for data packaging. The tool activates and calls a DSpace Integration Module. This module establishes a connection with DSpace. After the connection is established, DSpace sends a confirmation. The DSpace Integration Module then passes the packaged data back to the developer who uses this data in pipelines that use DSpace.

Please note that some parameters or operations might need refinement depending on the specific operation details or SDKs/APIs that the DSpace Integration process would entail. Also, this is a just basic outline and things like error handling etc. are not covered.

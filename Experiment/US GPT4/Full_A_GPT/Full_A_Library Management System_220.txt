As an AI developed by OpenAI, I can't create diagrams or images. However, I can definitely guide you in creating sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story:

The sequence of events for the user story - "As a manager, I want to see missing book numbers" can be represented as:
1. The Manager requests the system to view all the book records.
2. The System retrieves the data from the Inventory.
3. The System processes the data and identifies missing book numbers.
4. The System presents the list of missing book numbers to the Manager.

Rendered in PlantUML format, the above sequence can be written as the following:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor "Library Manager" as Manager
participant "Library Management System" as System
database "Inventory" as Database

Manager -> System: Request for book records
System -> Database: Retrieve data
Database -> System: Send data
System -> System: Process and identify missing books
System -> Manager: Display missing book numbers
@enduml
```

You can use any tool that supports PlantUML diagrams to render this sequence. The detailed initiations, responses, and processes may vary depending on the exact requirements of your project.

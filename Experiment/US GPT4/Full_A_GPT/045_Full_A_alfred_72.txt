Due to technical limitations, I'm unable to generate an image here. However, here's a sample representation of how you can create a sequence diagram for the provided user story using PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "OlderPerson" as A
participant "ALFRED" as B
participant "Data Server" as C

activate A
A -> B : gives voice command, "Search for art expositions"
activate B
B -> C: sends query for "art expositions"
activate C
C --> B : returns relevant art exposition information
deactivate C
B --> A: provides information on art expositions
deactivate B

A -> B : gives voice command, "Search for museums"
activate B
B -> C: sends query for "museums"
activate C
C --> B : returns relevant museum information
deactivate C
B --> A: provides information on museums
deactivate B
deactivate A
@enduml
```

The diagram starts with the `OlderPerson` giving a voice command to `ALFRED` to search for art expositions and museums. `ALFRED` in turn, sends a query to the `Data Server` which returns the information to `ALFRED`. Finally, `ALFRED` provides the information to the `OlderPerson.`

Remember that this is a rough sequence diagram that fits the user story and the actual integration and layers of software might require the addition of extra steps and participants.

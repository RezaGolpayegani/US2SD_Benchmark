Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model, I'm not able to generate images or diagrams. But I can describe the sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the given user story.

Here's a sequence diagram would look in Plant UML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
title View Orders Sequence Diagram

actor Waiter
participant "ManagementSoftware" as M

Waiter -> M : Login()
M -> Waiter: ShowWaiterDashboard()
Waiter -> M : ClickViewOrders()
M -> Waiter: DisplayOrders()

@enduml
```
What each command means:

- Waiter logs into management software.
- The software then interfaces with Waiter to show the waiter's dashboard.
- The Waiter, to view orders, clicks the 'View Orders' option.
- The management software then fetches and displays the orders to the Waiter.

It is worth noting that this is a high-level sequence diagram and the exact details would depend on the specific functional requirements and constraints of your software.

Please, copy and paste the provided PlantUML code into any online PlantUML tool to get a visual representation of the sequence diagram.

As this is a text-based platform, it is not possible to draw a detailed sequence diagram here. However, I can provide the necessary PlantUML syntax that you can run in any PlantUML editor to generate a sequence diagram for this specific user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist
participant System

Archivist -> System: Login
activate Archivist
activate System

System -> Archivist: Show Dashboard
Archivist -> System: Select "Manage Archives"
System -> Archivist: Show Archive List

Archivist -> System: Select Archive File
System -> Archivist: Show File Details

Archivist -> System: Select "Add restriction date"
System -> Archivist: Show Date Input Form

Archivist -> System: Input End Date
System -> Archivist: Confirm Input

Archivist -> System: Submit Date
System --> Archivist: Show Confirmation Message
deactivate Archivist
deactivate System
@enduml
```
This PlantUML sequence diagram represents the interaction between an archivist and the archiving system. The archivist logs into the system, accesses the archive management interface, selects a specific file, adds a restriction end date to it, and receives a confirmation message. Input this into a Plant UML generator to see the diagram.

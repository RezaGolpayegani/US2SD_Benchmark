Creating a detailed sequence diagram for a specific user story like "As a waiter, I want to deselect order items." would be extremely difficult in text because UML diagrams are ideally a visual product. However, using Plant UML language, the sequence diagram would look something like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
title DeSelect Order Items Sequence Diagram

actor Waiter as wait
entity OrderManagement as ord
entity Database as db
box "Restaurant System" #LightPink 
  participant OrderItem as itm
end box

activate wait
wait -> ord: deselectOrder(int orderID, int itemID)
activate ord
ord -> db: getItem(int itemID)
activate db
db --> ord: Item
deactivate db
ord -> itm: deselectItem(Item item)
activate itm
itm -> db : updateItemStatus(int itemID, String status)
activate db
db --> itm: Confirmation
deactivate db
itm --> ord: Confirmation
deactivate itm
ord --> wait: Confirmation
deactivate ord
deactivate wait

This PlantUML code could be used to generate a sequence diagram for the case of a waiter deselecting order items. Of course, the code needs to be put into a PlantUML compiler to visualize it. 
The flow starts from the waiter initiating an order item deselection. The order management system gets the information of item from database and calls the `deselectItem` method. The order item status updates in the database and confirmation messages are passed back up the chain to the waiter.

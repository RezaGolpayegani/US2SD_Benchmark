As this is a text-based medium, I will write the required PlantUML code for your sequence diagram.

```
@startuml
participant Staff
participant System
participant Inventory

Staff -> System : Enter Book Details
activate System
System -> Inventory : Check if ID exists
activate Inventory
Inventory --> System : Confirm ID uniqueness
deactivate Inventory
alt ID is unique
    System --> Staff : Confirm unique ID
else ID is not unique
    System --> Staff : Request new ID
end
deactivate System
@enduml
```
To visualize the sequence diagram you need to copy the entire code and paste it into a PlantUML compiler. In the diagram, the staff enters the book details into the system. The system then checks with inventory if the ID exists. If the ID is unique, it confirms with the staff that the ID is unique and can be used. If not, it requests a new unique ID from the staff.

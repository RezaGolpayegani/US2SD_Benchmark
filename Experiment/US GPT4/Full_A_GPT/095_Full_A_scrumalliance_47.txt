Generating a sequence diagram in PlantUML for this user story involves breaking down the user actions into a sequence of events and illustrating these event sequences:

```plantuml
@startuml 
participant "Admin" as A
participant "Online Platform" as P
participant "Database" as D

A -> P : Authenticate
activate P
P -> D : Check credentials
activate D 
D --> P : Returns Authentication result
deactivate D
P --> A : Returns Authentication result
deactivate P

A -> P : Selects Help Wanted Ad
activate P
P -> D : Retrieve Ad details
activate D 
D --> P : Returns Ad details
deactivate D
P --> A : Show Ad details
deactivate P

A -> P : Edit or Delete Ad
activate P
P -> D : Update or Remove Ad info
activate D 
D --> P : Confirm changes
deactivate D
P --> A : Confirm changes

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram starts with the admin authenticating on the platform. After checking the admin's credentials with the database, the server shows the related ad details to the admin. The admin then decides to either edit or delete the ad. The server enacts the changes on the database based on the admin's choice and confirms the changes to the admin.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to achieve the creation of a Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format on platforms like this. 

However, I can provide an example of how to depict the use case you gave above, which you can use as a reference to create your sequence diagram.

```PlantUML

@startuml
participant "Anonymous User" as A
participant "System" as S

A -> S : RequestSummitList()
activate S
S --> S : Load Summit Data
S --> A : Display Summit List
deactivate S
@enduml
```
In this code,

- This starts with the anonymous user requesting the summit list from the system
- The system then activates in response to this request
- The system loads the summit data and then returns the summit list to the anonymous user
- The system is then deactivated

You can create a more detailed version based on the actual functions involved in your application. This approach can be applied to other user stories as well. 

Please note that this is a simplified version of how a PlantUML sequence diagram is created for a simple user story. The complexity and depth of these diagrams can increase substantially as you incorporate more functionalities, entities, and dependencies.

I'm an AI and incapable of generating images or diagrams, but I can guide you through the steps on how to create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for this user story:

1. For the sequence diagram, determine the actors and actions involved in this user story. In this case, the actor would be the "Archivist" and the system that the Archivist is interacting with is the "Archiving System". The specific action that the Archivist is making will be "restricting a file from view".

2. Next we need to translate this scenario into PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Archivist" as A
participant "Archiving System" as S

A -> S: requestFile(fileID)
activate S
note right: Archivist requests a specific file

S --> A: returnFile(fileID)
deactivate S
note right: The system returns the requested file

A -> S: restrictView(fileID)
activate S
note right: Archivist restricts the view of the file 

S --> A: confirmRestriction(fileID)
deactivate S
note right: System confirms the restriction

3. You can then paste this code into a PlantUML tool (online or downloaded on your computer) to get the sequence diagram.

Please note that the sequence mentioned is basic and based on assumptions since the project description doesn't provide detailed discusses about limiting the access to a file. I'd recommend adjusting the sequence to better fit the actual steps needed to restrict files based on your project's specifications and requirements.

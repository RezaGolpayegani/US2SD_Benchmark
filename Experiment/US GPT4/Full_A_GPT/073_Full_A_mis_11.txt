As an AI model, I cannot draw diagrams here. However, I can guide you on how to generate the sequence diagram based on the user story.

The User Story: "As a collection curator, I want to have the repository queue my collection for replication upon ingest to our remote storage site and to display the remote replication status in each item and component page in the staff interface."

Based on the user story, the flow of the sequence diagram might look like this:
- The Collection Curator (actor) initiates the process by inputting the collection into the repository system.
- The Repository System receives the input and starts the Ingestion process.
- Upon completion, the Repository System queues the collection for replication to the Remote Storage Site.
- The Repository System then communicates with the Remote Storage Site to initiate the replication process.
- The Remote Storage Site receives the replication request and starts replicating.
- Upon completion, the Remote Storage Site sends replication status to the Repository System.
- The Repository System receives and processes the replication status.
- Upon completion, the Repository System displays the remote replication status in each item and component page in the staff interface.
- The Collection Curator views the replication status.


Representation in PlantUML format would look something like this (code):

```
@startuml
actor "Collection Curator" as A
entity "Repository System" as B
database "Remote Storage Site" as C

A -> B: Ingest Collection
activate B
B -> B: Queue for Replication
B -> C: Start Replication
activate C
C --> B: Replication Status
deactivate C
B -> B: Process Replication Status
B -> A: Display Replication Status
deactivate B
@enduml
```

Please note that you would need to enter this code in a PlantUML editor to view the sequence diagram. This code represents a simplified version of the process, and may need additional detail and specifications depending on the precise requirements.

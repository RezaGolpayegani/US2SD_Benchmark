I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I can't generate diagrams, sketches, or any visual content. However, I can describe the sequence in PlantUML syntax which could be converted into a diagram.

Here is a textual representation of a sequence diagram:

```
@startuml

actor "Plugin Developer"
boundary "Plugin UI"
control "Version Controller"
entity "Code Updater"
database "Dataset Instance"
database "New Pipeline Version"

"Plugin Developer" -> "Plugin UI" : Deploys a new version
"Plugin UI" -> "Version Controller" : Create a version
"Version Controller" -> "Code Updater" : Notify to upgrade code
"Code Updater" -> "Dataset Instance" : Upgrade dataset type code
"Code Updater" -> "Version Controller" : Confirm upgrade
"Version Controller" -> "New Pipeline Version" : Update pipeline version
"Version Controller" -> "Plugin UI" : Confirm new version deployment

@enduml
```

The sequence starts with the plugin developer deploying a new version of the plugin via the Plugin UI. The Version Controller then creates a new version and notifies the Code Updater. The Code Updater then upgrades the dataset type code for the Dataset Instance and confirms the upgrade with the Version Controller. The Version Controller then updates the pipeline version and confirms the deployment of the new version via the Plugin UI. 

Remember that to generate the actual sequence diagram, you would need to copy and paste this PlantUML syntax into a PlantUML compiler/rendering tool.

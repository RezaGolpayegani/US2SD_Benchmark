Given that this platform doesn't support Plant UML diagrams, here are the lines of code required to build a sequence diagram based on the user story. You can copy and paste these lines of code into any software that supports Plant UML to generate the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
title User Story: As a customer, I want to see the menu

actor Customer
box "Restaurant Management System"
  entity "Menu Access"
  database "Menu Database"
end box

Customer -> "Menu Access": Request for the menu
"Menu Access" -> "Menu Database": Retrieves the menu
"Menu Database" -->> "Menu Access": Provides the menu
"Menu Access" -->> Customer: Displays menu

@enduml
```
This diagram shows the interactions between a customer and the restaurant management system when the customer wants to view the menu. 

To explain the sequence diagram, initially, the customer requests to view the menu. The request is received by the "Menu Access" which interacts with the "Menu Database" to retrieve the requested menu. The "Menu Database" then provides the menu which the "Menu Access" displays to the customer.

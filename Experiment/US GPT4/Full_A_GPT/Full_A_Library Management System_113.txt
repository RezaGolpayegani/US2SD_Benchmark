I regret to inform you that it's not possible for me to generate a sequence diagram using text as this is a static text-based platform. However, I can provide you with a textual description on how a sequence diagram of your desired User Story could look like using Plant UML notations. 

Here's a basic example:

'''
@startuml

participant "Library Manager" as L 

participant "Library Management System" as LS

participant "Database" as D

L -> LS : request to assign ID
activate LS
create "Book"
LS -> "Book" : create()
note right: Book instance is created

LS -> "Book" : assignID()
note right: Unique ID is assigned to the book
"Book" -> LS : return confirmation message
deactivate "Book"
LS --> L : return confirmation message

LS -> D : update database
note right: Database is updated with new book ID

deactivate LS
@enduml
'''

Please note that the above sequence has been definitely simplified for illustration purposes. There might be more interactions necessary depending on the exact requirements of the system. To visualize the sequence diagram based on the PlantUML text description, you can use tools or online websites that are able to generate UML diagrams, such as draw.io, GenMyModel, or PlantText.

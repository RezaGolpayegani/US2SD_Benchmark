Here is a basic sequence diagram in Plant UML format for this user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Librarian
participant "Library Management System" as System
participant Database

Librarian -> System: Request expired books
activate System
System -> Database: Fetch expired books
activate Database
Database --> System: Return expired books
deactivate Database
System --> Librarian: Display expired books
deactivate System

Librarian -> System: Select expired books for notification
activate System

System -> Database: Fetch borrower details
activate Database
Database --> System: Return borrower details
deactivate Database

System --> Librarian: Display borrower details
deactivate System

Librarian -> System: Send notification for expired books
activate System
System --> Librarian: Confirm notification sent
deactivate System

```

This diagram provides a walk through of the scenario starting from the librarian requesting the expired books from the Library Management System. After the system fetches the expired books from the database, it is displayed to the librarian. Then librarian selects the books for which notifications have to be sent, then system fetch the borrower details and shows them to librarian. Upon confirmation from librarian, system sends notification to the respective borrowers and confirms the action to the librarian. The system's interactions with the database and the librarian are inside activation bars to indicate periods of activity.

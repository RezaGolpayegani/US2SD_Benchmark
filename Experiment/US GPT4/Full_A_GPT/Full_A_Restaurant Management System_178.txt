Sorry, but I'm an AI and can't generate UML images featuring a sequence diagram based on the project description. However, I can provide you with an example script in PlantUML language how you can generate the sequence diagram:

This script represents a sequence of interactions between a manager, management system, and database where a manager views the orders.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "Management System" as MS
participant "Database" as D

M -> MS: Request orders
activate MS
MS -> D: Fetch orders
activate D
D --> MS: Return orders
deactivate D
MS --> M: Display orders
deactivate MS
@enduml
```

Above PlantUML script describes following steps:
1. Manager sends a request to view orders to the management system.
2. The management system then requests to fetch orders from the database.
3. The database returns orders to the management system.
4. The management system then displays orders to the manager.

You can use this script on any online PlantUML editor to generate the sequence diagram. This visualization will help you to understand how manager interacts with the system to view orders. 

Please note, you need to design more complex diagrams for comprehensive scenarios or large software systems. This is a simple example to get you started.

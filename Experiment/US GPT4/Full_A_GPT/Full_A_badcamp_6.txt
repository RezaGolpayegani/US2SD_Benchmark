As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I am currently unable to generate diagrams; however, I can help you to describe how the Plant UML sequence diagram for your User Story would look like:

```
@startuml

box "Trainee Module"

actor Trainee
participant "Trainee Module - FrontEnd" as TM
participant "Back-End/Server" as Server
participant  DataBase

Trainee -> TM : (1. Register For Training)
TM -> Server : (2. Verify User) 
Server -> Database : (3. Check Last Registration Time)
Database -->> Server: (4. Last Registration Data)
alt Registration Time more than 24 hours ago
    Server -> TM: (5. Registration Permitted)
    TM -> Trainee: (6. Fill Registration Form)
    Trainee -> TM: (7. Submit Registration Form)
    TM -> Server: (8. User Registration Data)
    Server -> Database: (9. Store User Registration)
    Database --> Server: (10. Confirmation of Stored Data)
    Server --> TM: (11. Confirmation of Successful Registration)
    TM --> Trainee: (12. Successful Regisration Message)
else Registration Time less than 24 hours
    Server -> TM: (13. Registration Not Permitted)
    TM --> Trainee: (14. Message to register next day)
end

This sequence diagram explains the process for verifying a user's ability to register for an event, based on whether they've registered for anything in the past 24 hours.

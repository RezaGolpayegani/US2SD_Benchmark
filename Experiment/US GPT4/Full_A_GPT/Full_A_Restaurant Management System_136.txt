Here is the sequence diagram code in PlantUML format for the user story "As a manager, I want to edit employee shifts":

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Manager
participant "Management System" as MS
participant "Database" as DB

Manager -> MS: Request employee shift info
activate MS
MS -> DB: Queries shift info
activate DB
DB -->> MS: Send shift info
deactivate DB
MS -->> Manager: Display shift info
deactivate MS

Manager -> MS: Request to edit shift
activate MS
MS -> DB: Query to update shift
activate DB
DB -->> MS: Confirm shift update
deactivate DB
MS -->> Manager: Confirm shift update
deactivate MS

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram illustrates the steps from the manager's request to edit shifts, to the communication between the management system and the database to fetch and update shift information, and finally the confirmation of the updated shift. Remember to compile the PlantUML code in an environment that supports it to visualize the sequence diagram.

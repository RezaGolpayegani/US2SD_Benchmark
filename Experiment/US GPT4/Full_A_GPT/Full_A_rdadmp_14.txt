Here's an example of a Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format based on the provided User Story. This diagram is a simplified example to illustrate the sequence of interactions between different objects (User, DMP, Metadata, Data Catalogue).

```PlantUML
@startuml
participant "Data Librarian" as A
participant "DMP" as B
participant "Other Systems" as C
participant "Data Catalogue" as D

A -> B : Request pointers to metadata
activate B
B -> C : Retrieve metadata pointers
activate C
C --> B : Return metadata pointers
deactivate C
B --> A : Provide pointers 
deactivate B
A -> D : Import metadata using pointers
activate D
D --> A : Confirm metadata import
deactivate D
@enduml
```

The sequence starts with the Data Librarian requesting the DMP to get pointers to the metadata. The DMP then retrieves these pointers from the Other Systems. Once the Other Systems return the pointers, the DMP forwards these pointers to the Data Librarian. The Librarian then imports this metadata into the Data Catalogue using the pointers. Finally, the Data Catalogue confirms the successful metadata import. Remember, further details could be added depending upon your system architecture and design complexities.

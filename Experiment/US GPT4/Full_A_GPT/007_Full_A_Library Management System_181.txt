Below is the representation of a detailed sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story: As a library member, I want to sort & filter my search results, so that I can refine my selection.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Member" as A
participant "Web Interface" as B
participant "Library Management System" as C
participant "Database" as D

A -> B : Inputs search parameters
activate B
B -> C : Sends search request
deactivate B
activate C
C -> D : Request for book data
activate D
D --> C : Sends book data
deactivate D
activate B
C -> B : Sends book search results
deactivate C
B --> A : Displays search results
A -> B : Selects sort & filter options
activate B
B -> C : Sends sorting and filtering request
deactivate B
activate C
C -> D : Request for redefined search data
activate D
D --> C : Sends redefined search data
deactivate D
activate B
C -> B : Sends refined book search results

This represents the sequence of interactions between the library member, the website interface, the library management system, and the database in the context of sorting and filtering search results.

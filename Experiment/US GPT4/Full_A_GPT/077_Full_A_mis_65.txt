Creating a sequence diagram for the above user story would require understanding the workflow involved in viewing available versions of an object and restoring a version from the staff interface. While the exact details would depend on the specifics of the project, a generalized PlantUML sequence diagram might look like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "Version Management System" as VMS
participant "Database" as DB

RM -> VMS: Request to view available versions
VMS -> DB: Fetch versions of object
DB --> VMS: Return versions data
VMS --> RM: Display available versions

RM -> VMS: Selects version to restore
VMS -> DB: Restore selected version
DB --> VMS: Confirm successful restoration
VMS --> RM: Deliver restoration successful message
@enduml
```

This is a simple sequence diagram just to visualize the interactions and might not cover all the specifics such as object locking, error handling, or notifying other users.
Please adapt this diagram as required by your specific project constraints and requirements. Remember that creating sequence diagrams often requires a good understanding of the technical implementation of the project.

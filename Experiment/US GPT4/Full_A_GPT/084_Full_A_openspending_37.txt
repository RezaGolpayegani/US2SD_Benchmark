This user story requires a typical sequence of obtaining access to the API, making a request, normalising data, and returning a response. Below is an example of a Plant UML sequence diagram for this user story.

```
@startuml
APIUser -> API: Request access token
API -> APIUser: Return access token
APIUser -> API: Send GET request with access token & desired indices (GINI, socioeconomic indexes)
API -> Database: Retrieve specific dataset
Database --> API: Return dataset
API -> NormalisationService: Normalise dataset with GINI and socioeconomic indexes
NormalisationService --> API: Return normalised dataset
API -> APIUser: Return normalised dataset response
@enduml
```

This diagram initiates with the API User requesting an access token to interact with the API. Once the access token is provided, the API User sends a GET request for a specific dataset and identifies the desired indices (in this case, GINI and specific socioeconomic indexes) to the API.

The API then retrieves this specific dataset from the database, gets the response, and uses a NormalisationService to normalise this dataset based on the requested GINI and socioeconomic indexes. The normalised dataset is then returned to the API User.

This diagram provides a simple sequence of user interactions, but the details might need to be adjusted depending on the specific API implementation, the details of the normalisation service, and the types of socioeconomic indexes used.

I'm sorry I can't provide a sequence diagram in the Plant UML format here as it is a text-based platform and the sequence diagram includes graphical notations. However, I can share a basic outline of the sequence diagram in text form based on the user story: As an employee, I want to add a store order:

Below is the sequence of operations that would need to occur:

1. The employee (actor) interacts with the Restaurant Management System and triggers the process of adding a store order.

2. The Restaurant Management System sends a request to the Order Management component.

3. The Order Management component prompts the Inventory Management component to confirm whether the ingredients for the order are available in inventory.

4. The Inventory Management component responds with the verification result.

5. If ingredients are available, the Order Management component processes the new order by updating the data in the system database.

6. The system shows a confirmation to the employee of a successful new order addition.

In the Plant UML format, this interaction may look something like this:

``` plantUML
@startuml
actor Employee
participant "Restaurant Management \n System" as RMS
participant "Order Management" as OM
participant "Inventory Management" as IM
database "System Database" as DB

Employee -> RMS : Add Store Order
RMS -> OM : Add Order
OM -> IM : Confirm Ingredient Availability
IM --> OM : Availability Confirmed
OM -> DB : Update Database with New Order
DB --> OM : Confirmation of Order Addition
OM --> RMS : Confirm Order Addition
RMS --> Employee : Order Added Successfully

You would input this into an environment which can read PlantUML formats and it would generate a sequence diagram as per your needs.

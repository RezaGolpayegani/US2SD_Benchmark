Creating a sequence diagram in PlantUML is a visual task which cannot be provided via text. However, I can provide you with the PlantUML code to put into a PlantUML editor, which will create a sequence diagram based on your user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Data Packager"
participant "Google Spreadsheet"

User -> "Data Packager": Open Data Packager
activate "Data Packager"
"Data Packager" --> User: Display Option to Import Google Spreadsheet
deactivate "Data Packager"
User -> "Data Packager": Choose to Import Google Spreadsheet
activate "Data Packager"
"Data Packager" -> "Google Spreadsheet": Request for Data
activate "Google Spreadsheet"
"Google Spreadsheet" --> "Data Packager": Send Data to Data Packager
deactivate "Google Spreadsheet"
"Data Packager" --> User: Data Imported Successfully
deactivate "Data Packager"
@enduml
```

Here are the steps to create the diagram:
1. Copy the PlantUML code.
2. Go to "www.planttext.com" or any other online PlantUML editor.
3. Paste the PlantUML code.
4. Click on the "Design" button to see your sequence diagram.

Below is the plantUML code that makes a sequence diagram which illustrates the user story provided.

```
@startuml

actor Employee
database RestaurantSystem

Employee -> RestaurantSystem: Request Active Orders by start date
activate RestaurantSystem

RestaurantSystem -> RestaurantSystem: Get Active Orders
activate RestaurantSystem

RestaurantSystem --> RestaurantSystem: Fetch Order Start Date
activate RestaurantSystem
deactivate RestaurantSystem

RestaurantSystem --> RestaurantSystem: Sort Orders by Start Date
activate RestaurantSystem
deactivate RestaurantSystem

RestaurantSystem --> Employee: Display Sorted Orders
deactivate RestaurantSystem

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. We have the `Employee` as the Actor.
2. The `Employee` through the Restaurant System software sends a request to the `RestaurantSystem` (database in this case) to get all the active orders.
3. The `RestaurantSystem` fetches these active orders, gets each of the order's start date.
4. The `RestaurantSystem` then sorts these orders by their start dates.
5. Finally, the `RestaurantSystem` sends the sorted orders to the `Employee` as requested.

Remember, this code should be used in a PlantUML environment to properly visualize the sequence diagram.

Creating a sequence diagram for the User Story: "As an OlderPerson, I want to have ALFRED to detect falls and send an emergency to a specific contact" in Plant UML language could look like this:

```plantuml
@startuml
' Defines the actors and their roles
actor OlderPerson as OP
participant "ALFRED System" as AS
participant "Fall Detection Sensor" as FDS
participant "Emergency Alert System" as EAS
participant "Specific Contact" as SC

' The chain of interactions
OP->AS : Uses ALFRED 
activate AS
AS->FDS : Activates Fall Detection Sensor 
activate FDS
FDS--AS : Sends Sensor Data
deactivate FDS
AS -> AS : Analyzes Sensor Data  
note right : If a fall is detected, Proceed to notify 
AS->EAS : Sends Emergency Alert
activate EAS
deactivate AS
EAS-->SC : Notifies Specific Contact 
note left : May include text, call or email feature
deactivate EAS
@enduml
```

This PlantUML diagram depicts the user (OlderPerson) interacting with the ALFRED system, which activates the Fall Detection Sensor. The sensor sends data back to the ALFRED system, which analyzes it. If ALFRED detects a fall, it sends an emergency alert to the Emergency Alert System, which notifies the specified contact. 

Please note that this sequence diagram is a high-level example, and the actual interactions and classes depend on a more detailed design or system architecture.

This sequence diagram represents the interactions among the repository manager and the DAMS in regard to retrieving all events related to an object's lifecycle. 

```plantuml

autonumber 
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "DAMS Interface" as DI
participant "Event Tracker" as ET
participant "Database" as DB

RM -> DI: Request object lifecycle

DI -> ET: Query for object events

ET -> DB: Retrieve object events

DB --> ET: Return event data

ET --> DI: Event data obtained

DI --> RM: Display event data

```

Here's the breakdown of the sequence:

1. The Repository Manager (RM) requests the lifecycle of an object from the DAMS Interface (DI).
2. The DI forwards this request to the Event Tracker (ET).
3. The ET queries the database (DB) to retrieve all events associated with the object.
4. The DB responds by returning the data of all the object-related events.
5. The ET confirms the receipt of event data and sends it back to DI.
6. The DI displays all the event data to the RM.

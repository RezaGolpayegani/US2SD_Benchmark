As an AI, I'm not able to generate images or diagrams, but I can certainly help you write the Plant UML code for creating a sequence diagram based on the user story you provided. Below is a simple mock-up of this:

```
@startuml

participant "Library Staff" as A
database "Repository" as B
participant "Statistics and Analytics Module" as C

A -> B: Request for usage statistics and analytics
activate B
B -> C: Initiate analytics data processing
activate C
C --> B: Return processed data
deactivate C
B --> A: Display statistics and analytics data
deactivate B

@enduml
```

This is a very simple interaction, and it just illustrates a library staff initiating a request to access usage statistics and analytics. This request is then processed by the Statistics and Analytics module of the database, and the data is then returned to the library staff member.

If your system has more elaborate interactions, you may need to consider that in your diagram. For example, if the library staff has to authenticate first, or if they can choose specific statistics/analytic views, all those would be additional steps in your sequence diagram.

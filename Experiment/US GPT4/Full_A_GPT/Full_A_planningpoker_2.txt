Here is the representation of the sequence diagram in PlantUML language:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Moderator" as M
database "Web Application" as WA
participant "Estimator" as E

M -> WA : Initiate Game Creation
activate WA
WA --> M : Provide Game URL
deactivate WA

M -> E : Share Game URL
activate E
E --> WA : Access Game URL
activate WA
WA --> E : Validate Access 
deactivate WA

activate M
M -> WA : Start Game
activate WA
WA --> M : Confirm Game Start
deactivate WA
deactivate M
@enduml
```

This PlantUML code illustrates the following sequence:

1. The "Moderator" initiates game creation in the "Web Application."
2. The "Web Application" provides a game URL to the "Moderator."
3. The "Moderator" then shares this URL with the "Estimator."
4. The "Estimator" accesses the game URL in the "Web Application."
5. The "Web Application" validates the access request from the "Estimator."
6. The "Moderator" starts the game in the "Web Application."
7. The "Web Application" confirms the game start to the "Moderator."

You can visualize this scenario by copy-pasting this plantuml code into any online plantuml renderer.

This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a site admin, a help wanted ads management system, and the database when the admin edits and deletes ads. When the admin sends edit and delete requests, the management system fetches the ad details from the database, shows them to the admin, validates the changes, and then updates or deletes the ad in the database. The system then sends the confirmation to the admin.

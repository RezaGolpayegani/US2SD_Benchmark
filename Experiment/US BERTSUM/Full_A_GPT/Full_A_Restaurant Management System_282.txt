As an AI model, I'm unable to create diagrams. However, I can generate a script to create a sequence diagram. Below you can find a script to generate a Plant UML sequence diagram for the user story:

```
@startuml
title Waiter Deselect Order Items Sequence Diagram

actor Waiter

box "Restaurant System" 
participant "Order Management"
participant "Order Item"
end box

== Deselect Order Items ==

Waiter -> Order Management: Open existing order
activate Order Management
Order Management --> Waiter: Display order items
deactivate Order Management
activate Waiter

Waiter -> Order Management: Identify item(s) to deselect
activate Order Management

Order Management -> Order Item: Deselect items
activate Order Item
Order Item --> Order Management: Confirm deselection
deactivate Order Item
Order Management --> Waiter: Confirm deselection
deactivate Order Management

Please make adaptations as you need. It's important to consider that this is a simple suggestion and software tools or systems may have different ways of handling such a user story.

To render the PlantUML diagram, you would need to put this code into a PlantUML environment and run it. You can use multiple online/offline text editors or IDEs that support rendering Plant UML diagrams, or you can render it on PlantUML online server.

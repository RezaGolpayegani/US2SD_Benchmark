Based on the provided user story, following is PlantUML code for the corresponding sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
actor Staff
entity System
entity Database

Staff --> System: Enter Book Details
System --> Database: Save Entered Details
Database --> System: Generate Unique ID
System --> Staff: Display Unique ID
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram shows the interaction between Staff, System, and Database.

1. The process begins when "Staff" enters the book details into the "System".
2. Then, "System" saves the entered details to the "Database".
3. "Database" then, in response, generates a unique ID for the book.
4. Finally, "System" displays the unique ID to the "Staff".

Please note that this is a simplified version and the real process might involve additional steps or entities based on actual implementation and business rules.

This basic sequence diagram details the interaction between a library staff member (User) and the bespoke system. The flow starts from the staff member logging into the system. Then, the staff member navigates to a specific project and chooses to customize the metadata fields. The system shows customizable options, user selects preferred options and saves the changes. Finally, the system acknowledges the changes.

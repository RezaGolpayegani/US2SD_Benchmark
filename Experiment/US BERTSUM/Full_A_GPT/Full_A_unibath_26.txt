Since providing a sequence diagram in text format might be complex to understand, here's a breakdown of how you could create one:

Following the user story, your sequence diagram would typically show that the data reuser interacts with a certain system (e.g. Database Management System) to get an example citation for a dataset. 

The sequence could be explained this way:

1. Data Reuser gets access to the Database Management System.
2. The Data Reuser sends the request to the system to view an example of citation.
3. The system queries the Database and fetches an example citation.
4. This citation is then presented back to the Data Reuser.

Translate these tasks into diagrams, your PlantUML code should look something like this:
```
@startuml

actor Data_Reuser
participant "Database\nManagement\nSystem" as DMS
database Database

Data_Reuser -> DMS: Request to view example citation
activate DMS
DMS -> Database: Queries for example citation
activate Database
Database --> DMS: Returns example citation
deactivate Database
DMS --> Data_Reuser: Displays example citation
deactivate DMS

@enduml
```
This code will generate a sequence diagram where the Data Reuser sends a request to the Database Management System to view an example citation. The system then queries the Database and gets the citation. Finally, the citation is displayed back to the Data Reuser. 

Please adjust this code according to the actual processes and classes identifiable in the actual system.

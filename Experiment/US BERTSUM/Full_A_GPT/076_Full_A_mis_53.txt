As a language model AI, I'm not able to visually render sequence diagrams using PlantUML. However, I can write a textual representation using PlantUML syntax based on your user story. This might be subject to changes based on the specifics of your system which is not stated in the user story.

Let's assume the sequence takes place between the User (data contributor), a Disaster Recovery Plan System, and a Grant Proposal System:

```plantuml
@startuml
User -> DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem: Request Disaster Recovery Plan
activate DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem
DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem -> DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem: Fetch Disaster Recovery Plan
DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem-->User: Show Disaster Recovery Plan
deactivate DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem
User -> GrantProposalSystem: Request to Include DRP in Proposal 
activate GrantProposalSystem
GrantProposalSystem -> GrantProposalSystem: Include DRP in Proposal
GrantProposalSystem-->User: Confirm Inclusion of DRP in Proposal
deactivate GrantProposalSystem
User -> DataManagementPlanSystem: Request to Refer DRP
activate DataManagementPlanSystem
DataManagementPlanSystem -> DataManagementPlanSystem: Refer DRP
DataManagementPlanSystem-->User: Confirm Referral of DRP
deactivate DataManagementPlanSystem
@enduml
```

This diagram suggests that:
- The user requests the Disaster Recovery Plan from the DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem.
- The DisasterRecoveryPlanSystem fetches the plan and shows it to the User.
- The user then requests the GrantProposalSystem to include the plan in a proposal. The system includes it and confirms this to the User.
- Finally, the user requests the DataManagementPlanSystem to refer the Disaster Recovery Plan. The system does so and then confirms this to the User.

Please revise this sequence diagram as per your exact system specification.

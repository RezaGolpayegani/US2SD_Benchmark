This is a text-based rendering and therefore it can't be converted into an actual diagram. However, the following is an example of what you might write using PlantUML notation:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor "Dataset Developer" as dev
participant "Dataset Type" as dt
participant "Dataset Instance" as di

dev -> dt : Deploy Dataset Type
activate dt
dev <- dt : Confirmation of Dataset Type Deployment
deactivate dt

dev -> di : Create Dataset Instance from Dataset Type
activate di
dev <- di : Confirmation of Dataset Instance Creation
deactivate di

dev -> di : Explore Dataset Instance
activate di
note right
 Dataset Instance returns relevant data
 to the Dataset Developer for exploration
end note
di --> dev : Return Dataset Information
deactivate di
@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram describes a user story where a Dataset Developer (actor) deploys a Dataset Type (participant), creates a Dataset Instance (participant) from the deployed Dataset Type, and then explores the created Dataset Instance. The Dataset Instance returns relevant data back to the Dataset Developer. Note that PlantUML does not automatically transform user requirements into sequence diagrams. It is needed to analyze the requirements and design the sequence diagram correspondingly, this is only a hypothetical situation.

As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to design visuals. However, I can provide you with a textural representation of the sequence diagram in Plant UML format.

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Moderator
actor Estimator
database Application

Moderator -> Application: Navigate to game settings
Application -> Moderator: Provide interface to invite Estimators
Moderator -> Application: Enter Estimator(s) email(s)
Application -> Application: Generate unique URL per Estimator

loop for each Estimator
    Application -> Estimator : Email URL invitation
    Estimator -> Application : Access URL 
    Application -> Estimator: Verify URL and show game info
end

Moderator -> Application : Start game button
Application -> Moderator : Show game status as 'ongoing'
Application -> Estimator: Notify game start

Note: This PlantUML sequence diagram assumes that the application/database is capable of handling tasks such as verifying URLs and sending notifications. If not, you may need to consider integrating your application with suitable external services. Working on and finishing the sequence diagram may need several iterations, different contexts might result in different sequence diagrams.

This sequence diagram involves 4 participants: the Moderator, the Game System, a Database, and a File System.

The sequence starts when the Moderator requests a transcript from the Game System. The system then fetches the game data from the Database. Once the game data is fetched and returned, the Game System converts the data into HTML format. This HTML is then written to a file in the File System. After the file has been written, the File System confirms back to the Game System. The Game System then returns the file path or download link to the Moderator.

Creating a detailed Sequence Diagram to illustrate how a developer would integrate data-packaged data with pipelines that use DSpace is a complex process. I can guide you on how it could be structured but regrettably, as a text-based AI model, I'm unable to make actual diagrams. Here is a textual representation of how the PlantUML commands could look to create the desired Sequence Diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Developer
participant DSpaceAPI
participant DataPackage
participant Pipeline

Developer -> DSpaceAPI : initiateIntegration()
activate DSpaceAPI
DSpaceAPI -> DataPackage: requestData()
activate DataPackage

DataPackage --> DSpaceAPI: returnData()

DSpaceAPI -> Pipeline: sendData()
note right: Data is packaged for pipeline.

activate Pipeline
Pipeline --> DSpaceAPI: confirmReceipt()
DSpaceAPI --> Developer: confirmIntegration()

deactivate DataPackage
deactivate Pipeline
deactivate DSpaceAPI

@enduml
```

This UML script beginning with "@startuml" and ending with "@enduml" describes the sequence of steps where:

- The developer starts the integration with DSpace API.
- The API requests data from a data package.
- The data package returns the requested data.
- The API then sends received data package to the pipeline.
- The pipeline confirms the receipt of data.
- The API finally confirms the integration with Developer.

Please, take this information to someone knowledgeable in PlantUML who can generate the diagram for you.

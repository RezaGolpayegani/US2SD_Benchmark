As an AI, I'm unable to draw, but I can provide pseudo-code for generating a sequence diagram using Plant UML for the user story: "As a customer, I want to see menu", you specified:

```plaintext
@startuml

participant "Customer" as C
participant "System View" as S
participant "Database" as D

C -> S: Request to see the menu
activate S

S -> D: Fetch menu
activate D

D -->> S: Return menu data
deactivate D

S -->> C: Display menu
deactivate S

@enduml
```

Here's the explanation in terms of the sequence:

- The "Customer" sends a request to the "System view" to see the menu.
- The "System view" makes a request to the "Database" to fetch the menu information.
- The "Database" executes the command and returns the menu data to the "System view".
- The "System view" receives the data and displays the menu to the "Customer".

Note: The activation bars (`activate` / `deactivate`) show when a participant is performing some action or construct. These can be moved around or can be removed completely to reflect the specific behavior of your system.

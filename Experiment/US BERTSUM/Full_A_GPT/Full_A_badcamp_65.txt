Unfortunately, as text-based AI, I cannot directly create diagrams. However, I can provide you with a textual representation that you can use to create a sequence diagram on PlantUML.

Here's how your sequence diagram's text might look like.

```
@startuml
    participant "Anonymous User" as A
    participant "Web Server" as B
    participant "Summit Database" as C

    A -> B : Request for Summit List
    activate B
    B -> C : Query Summit List
    activate C
    C -->> B : Respond with Summit List
    deactivate C
    B -->> A : Display Summit List
    deactivate B
@enduml
```

This text will result in the following sequence:

1. An anonymous user sends a request for the summit list to the Web Server.
2. The Web Server becomes active.
3. The Web Server sends a query for the summit list to the Summit Database.
4. The Summit Database becomes active.
5. The Summit Database responds with the summit list to the Web Server and becomes inactive.
6. The Web Server displays the Summit list to the Anonymous and become inactive.

You can translate this text into a PlantUML sequence diagram. Just replace the "X -> Y: Action" instruction with your corresponding actions/methods for each object as per the project's requirements.

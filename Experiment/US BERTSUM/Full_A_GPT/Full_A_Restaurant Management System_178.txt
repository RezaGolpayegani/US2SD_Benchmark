As an AI model, I'm unable to create diagrams. However, I can verbally explain a sequence diagram according to the User Story you provided.

Please include Plant UML on your local machine to generate the diagram based on the provided instructions.

1. Manager initiates the "View Orders" action.
```
participant Manager
activate Manager
Manager -> OrderSystem: viewOrders()
```

2. The Order System fetches all the orders.
```
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> Database: fetchOrders()
activate Database
Database --> OrderSystem: Orders list
deactivate Database
```

3. The Order System sends retrieved orders to the Manager.
```
OrderSystem --> Manager: displayOrders(Orders list)
deactivate OrderSystem
```

4. Manager receives the "Orders List"
```
activate Manager
```

5. Manager ends the "View Orders" action.
```
deactivate Manager
```

Combine all these instructions and put it into your installed Plant UML, it will display the sequence diagram. Increase or decrease the complexity according to your exact requirement.

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story involves numerous actors such as Manager, Sales Database, Sales System, Salary System, and Employee Database.

Below is an example sequence diagram expressed in the PlantUML language:

```plantuml

actor "Manager" as A
database "Sales Database" as B
component "Sales System" as C
component "Salary System" as D
database "Employee Database" as E

A -> C : Request Total Sales
activate C
C -> B: Fetch Total Sales
activate B
B --> C : Return Total Sales
deactivate B
C --> A : Display Total Sales
deactivate C
A -> C: Request Total Profit
activate C
C -> B: Fetch Total Profit
activate B
B --> C : Return Total Profit
deactivate B
C --> A : Display Total Profit
deactivate C
A -> D: Determine Salaries based on Sales and Profit
activate D
D -> E: Fetch List of Employees
activate E
E --> D: Return List of Employees
deactivate E
D --> A: Display Determined Salaries
deactivate D
```

This diagram establishes a sequence of interactions between different elements based on the user story. The manager makes requests to the Sales System to get data about total sales and total profits. The Sales System interacts with the Sales Database to fetch needed data. Once the information is obtained, the Manager uses it to determine salaries with the help of the Salary System, which interacts with the Employee Database to apply the necessary changes.

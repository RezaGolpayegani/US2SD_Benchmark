To create the desired user story's sequence diagram, it's crucial to understand the steps for the agency user to get File F in the correct format. Since a project description wasn't provided, let's assume that it follows essential steps like file requesting, file conversion (if necessary), file validation, and file downloading. Here is a simple sequence diagram in basic PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AgencyUser
participant FileRequestHandler
participant FileConverter
participant FileValidator
participant FileDownloadService

AgencyUser -> FileRequestHandler : Request File F
FileRequestHandler -> FileConverter : Convert to correct format
FileConverter -> FileRequestHandler : Return converted file
FileRequestHandler -> FileValidator : Validate File Format
FileValidator -> FileRequestHandler : Return validation
FileRequestHandler -> AgencyUser : Send validated file 
AgencyUser -> FileDownloadService: Download File F in Correct Format
FileDownloadService -> AgencyUser: Return downloaded file
@enduml
```

This diagram's steps are:
1. The Agency User requests File F from the File Request Handler system.
2. The File Request Handler system sends the file to a File Converter system which provides the file in the correct format.
3. The converted file is sent back to the File Request Handler system.
4. The File Request Handler system sends the file to the File Validator system for format validation.
5. Validation results are sent back to the File Request Handler system.
6. After validation, the File Request Handler system sends the validated file back to the Agency User.
7. The Agency User requests a download from File Download Service.
8. The File Download Service provides the downloaded file to the Agency User.

This is a simplified sequence diagram and might need adjustments based on the real-world steps for your application flow.

As a language model AI, I don't have the ability to provide graphical content directly. However, using Textual description, I can suggest how the sequence diagram would look like in Plant UML format.

Sequence diagrams show object interactions in a graph format, with time increasing down the page. The objects involved in the operation are listed from left to right according to when they take part in the message sequence.

Please note that, in order to see the desired output of the code provided, you should use a PlantUML compiler.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Manager" as M
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as DB

M -> S: Request Customer Satisfaction Ratio
activate S
S -> DB: Retrieve Customer's feedback 
activate DB
DB-->S: Return Feedback data
deactivate DB
S->S: Calculate Satisfaction Ratio

S-->M: Return Satisfaction Ratio
deactivate S
@enduml
```

In this diagram:

- The "Manager" requests for the Customer Satisfaction Ratio, this message is sent to the "System".
- The "System" then retrieves all customers' feedback from the "Database".
- The "Database" returns the feedback data to the "System".
- The "System" after then calculates the satisfaction ratio and returns this ratio to the "Manager".

Please tailor this example to fit to your exact use case.

This diagram can be read by any program that supports PlantUML format. For example, PlantText or many IDEs with PlantUML plugin.

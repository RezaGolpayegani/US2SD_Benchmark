As a language model AI, I'm be unable to draw diagrams directly. However, I can provide a text-based representation of a possible sequence in Plant UML format. To achieve this, you can use this suggested sequence:

```java
@startuml
actor StaffMember as "Library Staff Member"
boundary "Usage Stats System" as US
database "Data Repository" as DB

StaffMember -> US : Request repository-level statistics
activate US
US -> DB : Fetch repository-level data
activate DB
DB -->> US : Responds with data
DEACTIVATE DB
US -->> StaffMember : Shows repository-level statistics
DEACTIVATE US
   
StaffMember -> US : Request collection-level statistics
activate US
US -> DB : Fetch collection-level data
activate DB
DB -->> US : Responds with data
DEACTIVATE DB
US -->> StaffMember : Shows collection-level statistics
DEACTIVATE US
   
StaffMember -> US : Request author-level statistics
activate US
US -> DB : Fetch author-level data
activate DB
DB -->> US : Responds with data
DEACTIVATE DB
US -->> StaffMember : Shows author-level statistics
DEACTIVATE US
      
StaffMember -> US : Request item-level statistics
activate US
US -> DB : Fetch item-level data
activate DB
DB -->> US : Responds with data
DEACTIVATE DB
US -->> StaffMember: Shows item-level statistics
DEACTIVATE US

```

This sequence involves a Library Staff Member actor that interact with a Usage Stats System (US) to fetch different types of statistics (at the repository, collection, author, and item level). US liaises with a Data Repository (DB) to fetch the necessary data per StaffMember's request.

Please substitute the "Usage Stats System" and "Data Repository" components according to your actual system's architecture and structure. Please use an appropriate software or online tool to visualize this Plant UML text into a sequence diagram.

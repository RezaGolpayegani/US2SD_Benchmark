As an AI, I currently lack the ability to provide visual content like diagrams. However, I can still recommend the steps and contents for creating the sequence diagram in Plant UML format.

Title: Sequence Diagram for Plugin Developer Using Custom Dataset

Participants: 
1. Plugin Developer
2. Plugin Interface
3. App
4. Custom Dataset

Flow:
1. Plugin Developer --> Plugin Interface: Request to use Custom Dataset.
2. Plugin Interface --> Custom Dataset : Query if Custom Dataset is available
3. alt is Custom Dataset available
    Custom Dataset --> Plugin Interface: Affirmative response - dataset available
        Plugin Interface --> Plugin Developer: Relay message dataset is available 
        Plugin Developer --> Custom Dataset : Start using Custom Dataset
    else
    Custom Dataset --> Plugin Interface: Negative response - dataset not available 
        Plugin Interface --> Plugin Developer: Relay message dataset is not available 
        Plugin Developer --> App : Request to deploy Custom Dataset
        App --> Custom Dataset : Deploy Custom Dataset
        Custom Dataset --> Plugin Developer: Notify on successful deployment 
    end

This sequence diagram reveals the interactions between the plugin developer, the plugin interface, the app, and the custom dataset during the process of the plugin developer requesting and potentially utilizing a custom dataset.

Please modify this textual content according to the standard PlantUML code in order to visualize the sequence diagram described here.

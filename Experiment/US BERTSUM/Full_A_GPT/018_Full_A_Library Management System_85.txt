A sequence diagram can't simply be explained into writing but should be visualized for a better understanding. However, below is a verbal representation of how you can create a UML sequence diagram for the described user story.

```
@startuml
title "Sequence Diagram: Expired Books and Notification"

actor Librarian as L
boundary "Library Application" as App
control "Book Controller" as BC
entity "Book" as B
database "Book Database" as DB

L -> App : Request list of expired books
App -> BC : Forward request to controller
BC -> B : Request expired books
B -> DB : Verify records 
DB -> B : Return list of expired books
B -> BC : Return list to controller
BC -> App : Return list to application
App -> L : Show list of expired books

L -> App : Selects a book for notification
App -> BC : Forward book selection
BC -> B : Request details for selected book
DB <-> B : Verify and Return book details
B -> BC : Return book details to controller
BC -> App : Return book details to application
App -> L : Show book details

L -> App : Request to send notification
App -> L : Confirm notification sending
L -> App : Confirms notification sending
App -> BC : Forward notification request
BC -> B : Request notification sending
DB <-> B : Update book status 
BC -> App : Confirm successful notification
App -> L : Show notification success message

This sequence diagram illustrates the process where the librarian requests for the books expired, views the details, and sends a notification. This Plant UML code can be visualized on any platform that supports it, giving a detailed sequence diagram.

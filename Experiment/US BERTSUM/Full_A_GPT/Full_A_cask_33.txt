Providing a detailed sequence diagram in a text format is a bit challenging due to the pictorial nature of the sequence diagrams. A simpler text description of diagram is provided:

Below is a depicted flow of operations:

1. The `Plugin Developer` initiates `Deploy Plugin` action on the `Plugin System`.

2. `Plugin System` executes `Check Current Version` process on `Plugin Database`.

3. `Current Version` from `Plugin Database` is returned to the `Plugin System`.

4. `Plugin System` sends a signal `Upgrade Data` to the `Dataset Instance` with new plugin version.

5. `Dataset Instance` sends a signal `Apply Upgrade` to the `Dataset Type`.

6. `Dataset Type` returns `Upgraded` signal back to the `Dataset Instance`.

7. `Dataset Instance` confirms upgrade to `Plugin System` by sending `Upgrade Completed` signal.

8. `Plugin System` processes `Update Pipeline` operation for `Pipeline System`.

9. `Pipeline System` returns confirmation `Pipeline Updated` back to the `Plugin System`.

10. `Plugin System` confirms the completion of deployment process to `Plugin Developer` by sending `Deployment successful` signal.

Note: The signals or methods should have parameters like `plugin version`, `dataset type`, `dataset instance` etc., based on actual requirements and system design.

This could potentially be implemented in Plant UML as follows:

```
@startuml
actor PluginDeveloper
entity PluginSystem
database PluginDatabase
entity DatasetInstance
entity DatasetType
entity PipelineSystem

PluginDeveloper -> PluginSystem: DeployPlugin()
PluginSystem -> PluginDatabase: CheckCurrentVersion()
PluginDatabase --> PluginSystem: CurrentVersion()
PluginSystem -> DatasetInstance: UpgradeData(newVersion)
DatasetInstance -> DatasetType: ApplyUpgrade()
DatasetType --> DatasetInstance: Upgraded()
DatasetInstance --> PluginSystem: UpgradeCompleted()
PluginSystem -> PipelineSystem: UpdatePipeline()
PipelineSystem --> PluginSystem: PipelineUpdated()
PluginSystem --> PluginDeveloper: DeploymentSuccessful()

Please update the text depiction and UML code as per your specific user story requirements and execution flows. 

Why is this critical? Because sequence diagrams are visual representations of how objects interact in a sequential manner. Therefore, any variation in the flow or objects' behavior can impact the structure and order of the sequence.

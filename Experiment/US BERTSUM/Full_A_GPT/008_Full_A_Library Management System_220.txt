As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to draw diagrams directly. However, I can provide you with the PlantUML code which you can convert into a sequence diagram through a PlantUML compiler. The scenario is quite simple, and it assumes a basic interaction with the system and database.

```
@startuml

participant "Manager" as M
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

M -> S: Request to check missing book numbers
activate S
S -> D: Queries for records of all book numbers
activate D
D -->> S: Returns all booked numbers
deactivate D
S -> S: Checks for any missing numbers
S -->> M: Displays missing book numbers
deactivate S

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the manager making a request to check for missing book numbers. The System then makes a query to the Database for all book numbers. The Database returns all book numbers, and the System checks for any missing numbers. Finally, the System will display any missing numbers to the Manager. 

Please take note, the simplicity or complexity of the sequence diagram can change depending on the actual behavior of your software system, the user story provided follows the assumption that your system's design is simple. If it includes additional layers or processes like authorization, caching, error handling etc., the diagram will be more complex.

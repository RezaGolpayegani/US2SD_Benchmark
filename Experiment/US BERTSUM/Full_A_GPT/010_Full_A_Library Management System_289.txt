As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to directly draw diagrams. However, I can provide you with a textual representation of how you could create a sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on your requirement. Here's a basic example:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Member" as M
participant "System" as S
database "Database" as D

-> M: Wants to see due date
activate M

M -> S: Request Due Date
activate S

S -> D: Fetch Due Date
activate D

D --> S: Return Due Date
deactivate D

S --> M: Show Due Date
deactivate S
deactivate M

@enduml
```

In this example, the process begins with the member wanting to view the due date. The member sends a request to the system, which then reaches out to the database to fetch the due date. The database returns the due date information to the system, which then shows it to the member. Activation and deactivation denote the start and end of a process or action in the sequence diagram.

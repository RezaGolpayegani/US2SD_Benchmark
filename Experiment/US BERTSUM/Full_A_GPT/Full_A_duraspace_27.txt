Here is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the user story:

@startuml
participant "Repository Manager" as RM
participant "LifeCycle Management System" as LMS
participant "Event Logger" as EL
participant "Object LifeCycle" as OLC

RM -> LMS : Request all events(ObjectId)
activate LMS
LMS -> EL : Fetch event logs(ObjectId)
activate EL
EL --> LMS : Return event logs
deactivate EL
LMS --> RM : Show event logs
deactivate LMS

RM -> LMS : Request LifeCycle(ObjectId)
activate LMS
LMS -> OLC : Fetch LifeCycle information(ObjectId)
activate OLC
OLC --> LMS : Return LifeCycle Information
deactivate OLC
LMS --> RM : Show LifeCycle Information
deactivate LMS

Explanation:
1. The repository manager sends a request to the LifeCycle Management System (LMS) to get all events for a certain object.
2. The LMS conveys this request to the Event Logger (EL).
3. The EL fetches the events associated with the object and sends it back to the LMS.
4. The LMS presents the logs to the repository manager.
5. The repository manager additionally requests the LifeCycle of the object from the LMS.
6. LMS sends this request to the Object LifeCycle (OLC) component.
7. The OLC fetches the lifecycle information and sends it back to the LMS.
8. Finally, the LMS presents this lifecycle information to the repository manager.

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the repository manager, LifeCycle Management System, Event Logger, and Object LifeCycle. It visualizes the process of obtaining all events and life cycle information related to an object in the repository.

Here is a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story:

```PlantUML
@startuml
title User Review

actor Employee
database System
actor Customer

Employee --> System: Login()
System --> Employee: ShowDashboard()
note right: Employee chooses to enter customer review section
Employee --> System: ChooseReviewsSection()
System --> Employee: ShowReviewsSection()

note right
    Employee initiates the process 
    to enter the customer review
end note

Employee --> System: InitiateReviewProcess()
System --> Employee: RequestCustomerDetails()

note right: Employee enters customer details
Employee --> System: EnterCustomerDetails(customer)
System --> Employee: ShowConfirmation()

note right
    System prompts that customer's consent 
    is needed to proceed
end note    

System --> Employee: NeedCustomerConsent()
Employee --> Customer: RequestConsent()
Customer --> Employee: GiveConsent()
Employee --> System: EnterConsent(customer)
System --> Employee: ShowReviewForm()

note right
    Employee enters review 
end note  

Employee --> System: EnterReviewDetails(review)
System --> Employee: ConfirmReviewSubmission()

What this diagram is essentially saying:

1. Employee logs into the system, the system shows the dashboard. Employee chooses to enter the Customer Reviews section, and system shows the Reviews section.

2. The employee then initiates the process to enter a review and the system requests the customer's details.

3. The employee enters the customer's details in the system, and the system shows a confirmation.

4. The system then prompts that the customer's consent is needed. Now, the employee contacts the customer to request their consent and receives the given consent.

5. This given consent is entered by the employee into the system, which then allows the system to display the "review form".

6. The employee then enters the review details into the system and the system confirms the review submission.

This is assuming that an Employee needs to individually request consent from customers, which would generally involve calling or emailing them. The process can change depending on the actual system.

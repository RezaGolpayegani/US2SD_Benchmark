Here is a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format taking into account the User Story.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Filter and Sort Search Results

actor "Library Member" as user

box "Library System"
participant "Search Module" as search
participant "Filter & Sort Module" as sort
participant "Database" as db
end box

user -> search: Perform Search
activate search

search -> db: Request Search Results
activate db

db --> search: Return Search Results
deactivate db

search --> user: Display Search Results
deactivate search

user -> sort: Request for Filtering/Sorting
activate sort

sort -> db: Retrieve Data based on Filter/Sort Criteria
activate db

db --> sort: Return Filtered/Sorted Data
deactivate db

sort --> user: Display Filtered/Sorted Results
deactivate sort

Explanation:
The user (library member) interacts with the search module in the library system to perform a search. The search module then requests search results from the database. The database returns the search results to the search module which then displays them to the user. 

If the user wants to filter or sort their results, they make a request to the filter and sort module. The filter and sort module then retrieves data from the database based on the user's specific filter and/or sort criteria. The database returns the appropriately filtered and/or sorted data to the filter and sort module, which then displays the final, refined results to the user.

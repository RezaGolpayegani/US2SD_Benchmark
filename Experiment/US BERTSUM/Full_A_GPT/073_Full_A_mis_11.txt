In this sequence diagram, it starts with the collection curator queuing a collection for replication using the repository. The repository then reaches out to the collection database and fetches the necessary information for replication. It then transmits these details to the Remote Storage Site (RSS) to begin replication.

Upon successful replication, RSS informs back to the repository. Now, the repository updates the replication status in the collection database. After updating the status, the repository confirms this update, then displays the replication status on the Staff Interface for the collection curator to see.

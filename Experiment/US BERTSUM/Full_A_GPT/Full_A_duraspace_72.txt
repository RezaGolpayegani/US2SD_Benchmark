Creating a detailed UML sequence diagram based on the user story could be illustrated in the script below.

However, note that PlantUML code can't be executed in this text-based context. Please make sure to transfer this code to your local PlantUML environment to visualize the Sequence Diagram.

In this sequence diagram:
1. The Repository Manager (RM) initiates the event by clicking "Assign Role" action.
2. UI responds and displays the role assignment page.
3. RM enters the necessary details (name, collection/object/component, role) into the interface which UI sends to the Role Management System (RMS).
4. RMS interacts with the Database (DB) to retrieve data and assign the role to the entered name.
5. The database confirms the role assignment, and RMS subsequently confirms it with the UI.
6. UI then shows a success message to RM, confirming that the role has been successfully assigned.

Due to the inability to display Plant UML in text format, a detailed textual representation of the sequence diagram is provided instead. Implement this sequence on any Plant UML editor.

1. The user (Consumer) will initiate the process by performing a 'view publisher profile' action. Trigger this action either through a button click or selection from a menu.

```plantuml
Consumer -> System: viewPubProfile(pubID)
```
  
2. The System then sends a request of 'get publisher profile' action to the 'Database'. Which involves fetching publisher's details by their ID.

```plantuml
System -> Database: getPubProfile(pubID)
```

3. The 'Database' will execute the 'get publisher profile' query and send the result (publisher's info) back to the System/Server.

```plantuml
Database --> System: PubProfile
```

4. The System then sends a request of 'get publisher packages' action to the 'Database'. This involves fetching the list of packages produced by the publisher by their ID.

```plantuml
System -> Database: getPubPackages(pubID)
```

5. The 'Database' will execute the 'get publisher packages' query and send the result (publisher's packages) back to the System/Server.

```plantuml
Database --> System: pubPackages
```

6. Once the System/Server receives the publisher's profile and the list of packages they produced, it will now present these data to the Consumer/User. The consumer will then see the publisher's profile and the packages they've produced.

```plantuml
System --> Consumer: showProfile(PubProfile, pubPackages)
```

This sequence diagram assumes a common consumer-system-database model where the consumer interacts with a system or application that handles all the requests and responses from the database. The "pubID" indicates the unique identifier of the publisher, "PubProfile" contains all the data of the publisher profile, and "pubPackages" is a list of all packages produced by the publisher.

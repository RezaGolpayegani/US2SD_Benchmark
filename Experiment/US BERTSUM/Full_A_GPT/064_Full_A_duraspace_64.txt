Here's a basic sequence diagram for the given user story written in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
box "Collection Management System" #LightBlue
participant ":System Backend" as BACK
end box

RM -> BACK: InitiateEdit()
activate BACK

BACK -> BACK: CheckAccessibility()
note right: Verifying Manager's access rights

BACK --> RM: RequestDetailInformation()
note left: Request for the detailed information to describe various facets

RM -> BACK: ProvideDetailInformation()
note left: Providing detailed information
activate BACK

BACK -> BACK: ProcessInformation()
note right: Process and validate provided information

BACK --> RM: AcknowledgeSavedInformation()
note left: Confirm that the information has been saved and described

deactivate BACK
@enduml
```

Please note that the specific calls might vary considerably depending on the actual system architecture and design decisions such as access rights, authentication, specific options per collection, object or component, etc.

The provided skeleton should give a good starting point and can be enriched with further detail as required. 

Make sure to edit the real operations on the `System Backend` accordingly (like `InitiateEdit()`,`CheckAccessibility()`,`ProcessInformation()`,`AcknowledgeSavedInformation()`, etc.), to reflect the real function names and variables used in your project.

Unfortunately, as a text-based assistant, I'm unable to create visual diagrams, including sequence diagrams. However, I can provide you with a skeleton of the Plant UML code which you would have to adjust based on the exact ordering and object details.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber

actor LibraryManager
entity LibraryDatabase

LibraryManager -> LibraryDatabase : createBookRecord()
activate LibraryDatabase
LibraryDatabase --> LibraryManager : askBookDetails()
activate LibraryManager
LibraryManager -> LibraryDatabase : sendBookDetails()
activate LibraryDatabase
LibraryDatabase --> LibraryManager : confirmRecordCreation()
deactivate LibraryDatabase
deactivate LibraryManager

@enduml
```

In this example:
- `LibraryManager` initiates to create a book record by sending a `createBookRecord()` message to the `LibraryDatabase` entity;
- Upon receiving the message, `LibraryDatabase` gets activated and requests the book details with the message `askBookDetails()`;
- `LibraryManager` then provides these details with `sendBookDetails()`;
- Once the `LibraryDatabase` successfully creates a record, it sends a confirmation message `confirmRecordCreation()` to the LibraryManager and the sequence ends.

Please adjust the code to suit your exact requirements and be sure to open it in some PlantUML environment to see the visual diagram.

As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate diagrams, but I can describe how the sequence diagram might look in PlantUML text-based syntax.

Creating a sequence diagram for this scenario involves the Developer as the actor, interacting with a system (for example, Clojure Application) that communicates with a Data Package Provider to get the data. The objective is to import data into the Clojure environment quickly to let the developer do data analysis and visualization.

Here's an outline of the diagram:

```puml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "Clojure Application" as App
participant "Data Package Provider" as Provider

Developer -> App: Request_Data_Package()
activate App

App -> Provider: Fetch_Data_Package()
activate Provider

Provider --> App: Return_Data_Package()
deactivate Provider

App --> Developer: Display_Data_Package()
deactivate App
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The Developer sends a request to the Clojure Application to get a specific data package (`Request_Data_Package()`).
2. The Clojure Application forwards this request to the Data Package Provider (`Fetch_Data_Package()`).
3. The Data Package Provider then returns the requested data package (`Return_Data_Package()`).
4. Finally, the Clojure Application displays the data package to the Developer (`Display_Data_Package()`).

To make this accurate to your use case, you may wish to substitute "Request_Data_Package", "Fetch_Data_Package", "Return_Data_Package", and "Display_Data_Package" with the specific functions or methods in your system, and replace "Data Package Provider" with the actual service or component the application interacts with to retrieve data.

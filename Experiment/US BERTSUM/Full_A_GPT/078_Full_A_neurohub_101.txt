To generate a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story, you need to understand the interactions between different entities within the system. Below is a simplified version of the sequence diagram depicting interactions among the `researcher`, the `repository system`, and the `group repository`:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor Researcher
participant "Repository System" as RS
participant "Group Repository" as GR

Researcher -> RS: Login(Credentials)
activate RS
RS --> Researcher: AuthenticationResult
deactivate RS

Researcher -> RS: Request(GroupRepository)
activate RS
RS -> GR: Request(GroupRepository)
activate GR
GR --> RS: Response(GroupRepositoryContent)
deactivate GR
RS --> Researcher: Response(GroupRepositoryContent)
deactivate RS

Researcher -> RS: Submit(NewPaper)
activate RS
RS -> GR: Insert(NewPaper)
activate GR
GR --> RS: InsertionResult
deactivate GR
RS --> Researcher: Response(InsertionResult)
deactivate RS
@enduml
```
This diagram reflects the need of the researcher to have a group-level repository where they can store and share papers or reviews. The researcher interacts with the repository system which in turn communicates with the group repository.

1. The sequence begins with the `Researcher` logging into the `Repository System`.
2. Then, the `Researcher` interacts with the `Repository System` and requests for the `Group Repository`. 
3. After this, the `Researcher` submits a new paper to the `Repository System`.
4. The `Repository System` then interacts with the `Group Repository` to insert the new paper.
5. Once the paper is inserted, it sends a response back to the `Repository System`, which then communicates the result back to the `Researcher`.

Remember to replace elements like `NewPaper`, `Credentials`, `GroupRepository`, `GroupRepositoryContent`, `AuthenticationResult`, and `InsertionResult` with fitting parameters while implementing.

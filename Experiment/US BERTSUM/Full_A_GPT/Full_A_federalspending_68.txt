Due to the limitations of this kind of platform, I cannot directly draw a sequence diagram here. However, I can provide you the PlantUML code that depicts the sequence diagram for the stated user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
title FABS User Error Submission

actor User
entity "FABS System" as FABS
database "Server" as DB

User -> FABS: Submit data
activate FABS

FABS -> DB: Validate submission data
activate DB

DB -->> FABS: Validation result
deactivate DB

alt Errors Found
    FABS -> DB: Get corresponding errors
    activate DB
    DB -->> FABS: FABS errors descriptions
    deactivate DB
    FABS -->> User: Display errors  
deactivate FABS
else No Errors
    FABS -->> User: Data submitted successfully
    deactivate FABS
end

This FABS User Error Submission diagram explains the process:

- The user submits data to the FABS System.
- FABS validates the submission data with the server/database.
- If errors are found, FABS retrieves the corresponding errors from the server, and these FABS error descriptions are shown to the user.
- If no errors are detected in the submission data, a "Data submitted successfully" message is shown to the user.

Here is a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format. This sequence is constructed under the assumption that the basic summit information already exists and is stored in a database or a similar structure.

In this scenario:

1) The "Summit Coordinator" initiates the process by requesting to list the summit's information.
2) The "System" then sends this request to the "Database" that stores the summit's information.
3) The "Database" fetches and returns the information to the "System".
4) The "System" then displays this information so it can be viewed by the "Summit Coordinator".

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Summit Coordinator" as coordinator
participant "System" as system
database "Database" as database

coordinator -> system: requestSummitInfo()
activate system
system -> database: getSummitInfo()
activate database
database -->> system: returnSummitInfo()
deactivate database
system -->> coordinator: displaySummitInfo()
deactivate system
@enduml
```

In this diagram: 

1) `requestSummitInfo()` represents the action performed by the Summit Coordinator to request the basic information about the summit.
2) `getSummitInfo()` is the system's request to the Database to retrieve the summit's data.
3) `returnSummitInfo()` represents the Database returning the requested information to the system.
4) `displaySummitInfo()` shows that the System then displays the retrieved information to the Summit Coordinator. 

Remember to replace the action and object names with the ones used in your actual source code or system architecture.

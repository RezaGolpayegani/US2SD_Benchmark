As requested, a sequence diagram is provided in Plant UML syntax. However, keep in mind that PlantUML does not render diagrams directly – you will need a PlantUML viewer or compiler to translate this code into a visual flowchart.

```PlantUML
@startuml

title Zooniverse admin - Picture analysis sequence diagram

actor "Zooniverse Admin" as Admin
boundary "UI Interface" as UI
control "Image Assessment System" as IAS

Admin -> UI : Assess Picture
UI -> IAS : Request Assessment
activate IAS
IAS -> UI : Need Automated Analysis
UI -> Admin : Initiate Automated Analysis

Admin --> UI : Perform Analysis
UI --> IAS : Return Analysis Result

IAS -> UI : Need Citizen Annotations
UI -> Admin : Initiate Annotations
Admin --> UI : Perform Annotations
UI --> IAS : Return Annotation Results

IAS -> UI : Need Talk Comments
UI -> Admin : Initiate Comment Collection
Admin --> UI : Collect Comments
UI --> IAS : Return Comments

IAS -> UI: Request Complete
UI -> Admin : Assessment Done
deactivate IAS

The sequence diagram follows this flow:

1. Admin requests the assessment of a picture.
2. The system requires automated analysis, which then the admin initiates.
3. The analysis results are returned to the system.
4. The system requires citizen annotations, which are performed and returned.
5. The system requires comments from Talk, which are collected and returned.
6. Once all data is collected, the system notifies the user interface that the request is complete.
7. The Admin is notified that the assessment is done.

This is simplified – actual data exchanges and possible error conditions are not considered. The actions "perform analysis", "perform annotations", and "collect comments" would likely be more complex and involve more system components.

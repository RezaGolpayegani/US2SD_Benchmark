We are not able to directly create diagrams or visual content for you as our capabilities are text-based. However, I'm able to guide you through the steps to create your own sequence diagram for your user story. Please install PlantUML and use the code below as the basis for your sequence diagram.

```PlantUML
@startuml
title Order Books by Title (Library System) 

actor LibraryMember
boundary BookCatalog 
control OrderSystem

LibraryMember -> BookCatalog : browseBooks()
activate BookCatalog 

BookCatalog --> LibraryMember : displayBooksList()
deactivate BookCatalog 

LibraryMember -> BookCatalog : orderBooksByTitle()
activate BookCatalog 

BookCatalog -> OrderSystem : sortBooksByTitle()
activate OrderSystem 

OrderSystem --> BookCatalog : sortedBooksList()
deactivate OrderSystem 

BookCatalog --> LibraryMember : showSortedBooks()
deactivate BookCatalog 

@enduml
```

This example assumes that "BookCatalog" is your system's module responsible for providing book listings and "OrderSystem" is the module to manage the sorting. Please adapt and expand it according to your specific system's design and requirements. To visualize this sequence diagram, paste this code into your PlantUML editor and generate the diagram.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need more help.

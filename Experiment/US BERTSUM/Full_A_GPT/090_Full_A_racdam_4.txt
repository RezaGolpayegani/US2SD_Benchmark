To represent a user story in a sequence diagram, we need to identify the actors (Archivist), the system, and the steps that each performs to fulfill the requirement. Here's an example of how you might represent it using plain text for Plant UML:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Restrict a File from View
actor Archivist

Archivist -> System: Log in
activate Archivist
activate System

System --> Archivist: Show files
deactivate System
activate Archivist

Archivist -> System: Choose file to restrict
deactivate Archivist
activate System

System --> Archivist: Prompt file restriction confirmation
deactivate System
activate Archivist

Archivist -> System: Confirm restriction
deactivate Archivist
activate System

System -> Database: Update file restriction status
activate Database

Database --> System: Confirm status change
deactivate Database
activate System

System --> Archivist: Confirm successful restriction 
deactivate System

@enduml
```

You can replace "System" and "Database" with specific software components as per your system design if necessary. Also, the flow can be adjusted based on exact functionality, such as when and how authentication occurs, whether the archivist needs to enter additional details for the file restriction, how errors are handled, etc.

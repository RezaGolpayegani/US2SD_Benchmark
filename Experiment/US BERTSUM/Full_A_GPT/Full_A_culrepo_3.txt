Unfortunately, generating detailed diagrams or any form of visual content is beyond my capabilities right now. However, I can help you by describing how to create a sequence diagram for this use case:

Here's the text-based sequence diagram:

The Plant UML code for this diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
title User Story: Upload and Associate Data with Publication
participant "Faculty Member" as A
participant "System" as B
participant "Repository" as C
participant "Publication" as D

A->B: Login to System
activate B

B-->A: Show Dashboard
A->B: Choose to upload data
activate B

B->A: Show Upload data form
A->B: Enter data details and upload data file
activate B

B->C: Save data to Repository
activate C

C-->B: Confirm data saved 
deactivate C

B->A: Show data uploaded successfully message

A->B: Choose to associate data with publication
activate B

B->A: Show Associate data form
A->B: Enter publication details and link data
activate B

B->D: Link data with Publication
activate D

D-->B: Confirm data linked to Publication  
deactivate D

B->A: Show data linked successfully message
deactivate B

```

This code generates a sequence diagram with the various entities involved -- `Faculty Member`, `System`, `Repository`, and `Publication`. It outlines the process of the faculty member logging into the system, uploading the data, having that data confirmed by the repository, linking that data to a publication, and receiving confirmation of that association.

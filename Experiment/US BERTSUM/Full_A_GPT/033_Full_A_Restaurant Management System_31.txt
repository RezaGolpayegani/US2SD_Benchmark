I apologize for any inconvenience, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can't design Sequence Diagrams directly here. However, I can provide a written description of a sequence diagram for your User Story:

```
@startuml
participant "Chef" as C
participant "Kitchen UI" as KUI
participant "Database" as DB

C -> KUI: Navigate to orders screen
KUI -> DB: Request list of orders
DB --> KUI: Return list of orders
KUI --> C: Display list of orders

C -> KUI: Select 'Can be served' for a specific order
KUI -> DB: Update order status
DB --> KUI: Confirm order update
KUI --> C: Display confirmation message
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:
1. The Chef navigates to the order screen on the Kitchen User Interface (KUI).
2. The KUI requests the list of orders from the Database (DB).
3. The DB returns the list of orders.
4. The KUI displays the list of orders to the Chef.
5. The Chef selects 'Can be served' for a specific order.
6. The KUI sends a request to the DB to update the order's status.
7. The DB confirms the order status update.
8. The KUI displays a confirmation message of the status update to the Chef.

You can easily convert this to a Plant UML format using a Plant UML tool or any supporting platform.

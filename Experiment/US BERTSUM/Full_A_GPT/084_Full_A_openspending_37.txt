This will involve creating a sequence diagram that demonstrates how the API user interacts with the system to normalize measures by GINI and related socio-economic indexes. The following is an example of what your sequence diagram might look like in PlantUML:

```sequence diagram
@startUML

title Normalize Measures by GINI Service

actor API_User
control NormalizationController
entity DatasetService as DS
database Database as DB

-> API_User : Sends normalization request
API_User -> NormalizationController : /normalize/{measures}
activate NormalizationController
NormalizationController -> DS : getDataset({measures})
activate DS
DS -> DB : FetchData({measures})
activate DB
DB --> DS : ReturnData
deactivate DB
DS --> NormalizationController : Dataset
deactivate DS
NormalizationController -> NormalizationController : calculateGINI(Dataset)
NormalizationController --> API_User : Return Normalized Data
deactivate NormalizationController

@endUML
```
The above sequence represents these steps:

1. An API user sends an HTTP request to normalize certain measures.
2. The NormalizationController gets the request and sends a call to DatasetService to fetch the necessary data.
3. DatasetService interacts with the Database to fetch the necessary information.
4. The Database returns the requested data to the DatasetService.
5. The DatasetService returns the dataset to the NormalizationController.
6. The NormalizationController performs the GINI normalization on the data fetched.
7. The results are returned back to the API User.
The above scenario is just an example and the diagram could change based on the actual system implementation.

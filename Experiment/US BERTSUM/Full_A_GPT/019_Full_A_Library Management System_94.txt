Below is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format that demonstrates the process of a librarian viewing the list of members:

```PlantUML
@startuml
actor Librarian
boundary LibrarySystem
control MemberListController
entity Member
database MemberDB

Librarian -> LibrarySystem : Requests to see the member list
activate LibrarySystem
LibrarySystem -> MemberListController : Forward request
activate MemberListController

MemberListController -> MemberDB : Query list of members
activate MemberDB
MemberDB --> MemberListController : Returns members data
deactivate MemberDB

MemberListController --> LibrarySystem : Return list of members
deactivate MemberListController
LibrarySystem --> Librarian : Displays members list
deactivate LibrarySystem
@enduml 
```
This sequence diagram follows the flow of action from the Librarian, through the LibrarySystem, and involves the MemberListController and the Member Database (MemberDB). The Librarian initiates a request to see the list of members, the LibrarySystem forwards that request to the MemberListController, which in turn queries the MemberDB for the list of members. The MemberDB then returns the data to the MemberListController, which sends it back to the LibrarySystem to display the members list to the Librarian.

Given the user story provided, a possible sequence diagram would involve the following actors and steps:

1. Member
2. System
3. Library Database

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant System
database LibraryDatabase

Member -> System : Request book due date
activate System
System -> LibraryDatabase : Get book due date
activate LibraryDatabase
LibraryDatabase --> System : Return book due date
deactivate LibraryDatabase
System --> Member : Display book due date
deactivate System
@enduml
```

This diagram represents the following steps in the user story:

1. The Member makes a request to the System to see the due date of the book.
2. The System then makes a request to the Library Database to get the due date of the book.
3. The Library Database returns the due date of the book to the System.
4. The System then displays the due date of the book to the Member.

This sequence diagram should be suitable to meet the requirements of the user story. Additional logic may be necessary for cases where the book is not currently borrowed, and therefore has no due date, or errors in retrieving information from the Library Database.

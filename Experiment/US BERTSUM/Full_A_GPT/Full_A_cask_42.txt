Since generating a detailed Sequence Diagram in textual format is complex and might be confusing, I will describe the sequence instead. You may want to convert it into a Plant UML diagram:

1. `User` -- Specify Schema --> `UI`: The sequence begins with the user invoking the action to specify the schema of a dataset from the user interface.

2. `UI` -- Forward Schema --> `Schema Service`: The user input is captured and sent on to the schema service by the UI.

3. `Schema Service` -- Validate Schema --> `Schema Validator`: The schema service calls the schema validator to validate the schema specified by the user.

4. `Schema Validator` -- Validation Result --> `Schema Service`: The schema validator returns the result of the schema validation to the schema service.

5. `Schema Service` -- Notify Result --> `UI`:  Depending on the validation result, the schema service notifies the user (via the UI) if the schema is valid, or it returns an error to be displayed to the user.

6. (When schema is valid) `Schema Service` -- Store Schema --> `Schema Storage`: When the schema is valid, the schema service subsequently calls the schema storage to store the schema specified.

7. `Schema Storage` -- Confirm Storage --> `Schema Service`: The schema storage returns a confirmation message to the schema service after successfully storing the schema.

8. `Schema Service` -- Confirm Completion --> `UI`: Once the schema service has received the confirmation, it sends a completion message to the UI.

9. `UI` -- Display Confirmation --> `User`: Finally, the UI presents the completion message to the user, indicating that the schema has been successfully specified and stored.

For this sequence diagram, the objects/actors involved might include: `User`, `UI` (User Interface), `Schema Service`, `Schema Validator`, and `Schema Storage`. 

Each interaction would be represented by an arrow, with the description of the action above it. The return arrow would also have a brief description of what is returned. Conditional statements (like when the schema is valid) should be represented as alt frames.

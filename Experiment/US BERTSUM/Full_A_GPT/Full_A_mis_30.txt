Based on the user story provided, the following is a sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "DigitalRecords Archivist" as A
participant "Authorization System" as B
participant "Repository Admin" as C

A -> B: verifyAdminIdentity()
activate B

B --> A: identityVerified()

A -> B: grantEmbargoPrivileges()
activate B

note right: The system updates the user's role to include embargo privileges.

B --> C: updateRole()
activate C
C -> C: addEmbargoPrivileges()
deactivate C

C --> A: privilegesGranted()

@enduml
```

In this sequence:

1) The DigitalRecords Archivist interacts with the Authorization System to verify their admin identity.

2) The Authorization System confirms the identity has been verified.

3) The DigitalRecords Archivist then requests to grant embargo privileges.

4) The system updates the user's role to include embargo privileges.

5) The system signals Repository Admin to update their role.

6) The Repository Admin adds embargo privileges.

7) The Repository Admin confirms to the DigitalRecords Archivist that the privileges have been granted.

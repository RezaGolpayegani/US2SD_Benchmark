In Plant UML, the syntax for sequence diagrams may not be understandable to those not familiar with coding. Here's an outlined version of the Sequence Diagram and mocked-up implementation of the given user story:

```plantuml
User -> DataPackager: Request to Import Data from Google Sheets
DataPackager -> GoogleAPI: Send Request for Authorization
GoogleAPI --> DataPackager: Request for Google Sheets Access

alt Account Authorized
    GoogleAPI --> DataPackager: Send Access Token
    DataPackager --> User: Show list of Google Sheets
    User -> DataPackager: Select Sheet and Confirm Import
    DataPackager -> GoogleAPI: Send Request to Fetch Data using Access Token
    GoogleAPI --> DataPackager: Send requested Data
    DataPackager -> Database: Upload Imported Data
    Database --> DataPackager: Confirm Data Stored
    DataPackager --> User: Confirm Imported, converted and Data is ready for use 
else Account Not Authorized
    GoogleAPI --> DataPackager: Deny Access
    DataPackager --> User: Request Manual Data Upload
end
```

This sequence insinuates the user requesting the importation of data from a Google Sheets document to the Data Packager. It then proceeds to request authorization of such action from the Google API. Upon authorization, it will fetch the required data, convert it and store it in the database for use by the data packager. If authorization fails, it asks the user to upload the data manually.

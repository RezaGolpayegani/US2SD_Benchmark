As an AI, I am unable to create the visual representation of a PlantUML diagram. However, I can provide you with a detailed text-based PlantUML sequence diagram code as per your Project Description and User Story. 

Here is an example:

```
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant "ALFRED" as A
database "ALFRED Database" as DB

OlderPerson -> A: Request for navigation
activate A
A -> DB: Retrieve Navigation Options
activate DB
DB --> A: Return Navigation Options
deactivate DB
A --> OlderPerson: Show Navigation Options
deactivate A

OlderPerson -> A: Select desired destination
activate A
A -> DB: Process destination request
activate DB
DB --> A: Provide navigation instruction
deactivate DB
A --> OlderPerson: Display navigation instruction
deactivate A

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- The OlderPerson interacts with the ALFRED system, requesting navigation.
- ALFRED then retrieves navigation options from its database.
- After receiving these options, the OlderPerson selects a desired destination.
- ALFRED processes this selection by requesting detailed instructions from its database.
- Finally, ALFRED communicates these navigation instructions back to the OlderPerson.

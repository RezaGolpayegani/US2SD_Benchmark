To create a sequence diagram, Plant UML syntax needs to be used, which unfortunately can't be illustrated perfectly in text. Below is a rough description of what the Plant UML code would look like. The message flow reflects the process that one might undertake to reserve more than one book as a library member.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember
entity "LibrarySystem" as Library
entity "LibraryDatabase" as Database

LibraryMember -> Library: Browse Book
Library -> Database: Query book availability
Database --> Library: Send back book information

loop 1, N
    LibraryMember -> Library: Reserve book
    Library -> Database: Update that book is reserved
    Database --> Library: Send back confirmation
end loop

Library --> LibraryMember: Confirmation of reservation
@enduml
```

- 'LibraryMember' is our actor who navigates through the library system to reserve books.
- Interaction starts with the member browsing for a book.
- The Library System then queries the Library Database for book information.
- The Library Database sends back the book information.
- The loop signifies that the member can reserve more than one book.
- After each reservation, the system updates the Database, which returns a confirmation.
- This loop continues for the number of books the member wants to reserve ('N').
- At the end, the Library Member gets a confirmation of their reservation from the system. 

This code needs to be rund through a Plant UML processor to create a visual sequence diagram. Also please note that the complexity of the system could vary and this is a simplistic representation. The actual system might require more steps or different interactions between the systems and users.

This detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format will assist in visually demonstrating interactions between different system components, including "Staff" and "LibrarySystem". 

The process starts with the staff intending to check out a book post reservation. The LibrarySystem checks if the book is reserved by the staff. If true, the book is checked out. If not, the staff will receive an error message.

```plaintext
@startuml
title Check Out a Book Process

actor Staff
participant LibrarySystem
participant Database

Staff -> LibrarySystem: CheckOut(BookID)
activate LibrarySystem

LibrarySystem -> Database: IsBookReservedByStaff(BookID, StaffID)
activate Database
Database -->> LibrarySystem: True
deactivate Database

alt True
    LibrarySystem -> Database: CheckOutBook(BookID, StaffID)
    activate Database
    Database -->> LibrarySystem: SuccessMessage
    deactivate Database
    
    LibrarySystem -->> Staff: SuccessMessage
else False
    LibrarySystem -->> Staff: ErrorMessage
end
deactivate LibrarySystem

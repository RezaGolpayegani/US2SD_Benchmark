In this project, the user story involves a library manager who wants to keep track of books and their checkouts. The system users include the library manager, the library system, and the library customer. The actors engaged in the system are the library manager and the library customer.

The process in the form of a sequence diagram will be as follow:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Library Manager" as Manager
actor "Library Customer" as Customer
entity "Library System" as System

Manager -> System : Login to library system
activate System
System --> Manager : Provide dashboard
Manager -> System : Navigate to books management
System --> Manager : Show books list

box "Checkout books process"
Manager -> System : Select specific book
System --> Manager : Show book details
Manager -> System : Check book availability
System --> Manager : Confirm availability
end box 

box "Customer Interaction for Checkout"
Manager -> Customer : Inform about availability
Customer --> Manager : Confirm checkout
Manager -> System : Record checkout in system
System --> Manager : Confirm checkout recorded
Manager --> Customer : Checkout completed
end box 

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram primarily illustrates the interaction between the library manager, the library system, and the client while checking out a book. The library manager starts by logging into the library system, which then provides them with a dashboard. The manager can navigate to the book management section, where the system displays a list of books. The manager then selects a specific book, which the system displays the details for. 

The manager checks the system for the book's availability. If available, the manager informs the customer who then confirms their willingness to checkout the book. The manager records the checkout in the system and this is confirmed by the system. The manager then confirms that the checkout process has been completed.

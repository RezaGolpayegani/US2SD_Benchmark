In Plant UML, the sequence diagram will be structured as follows:

```
@startuml
participant "App Developer" as D
participant "Deployment Process" as P
participant "Shared Dataset Instance" as DS
participant "Conflicting Version App" as CVA

D -> P: Request App Deployment
activate P
P -> DS: Check Dataset Version Compatibility
activate DS
DS -> DS: Version Matching
DS -> P: Return Status (Compatible / Incompatible)
deactivate DS
alt Incompatible Version
  P -> D: Return "Version Conflict Error"
  deactivate P
else Compatible Version
  P -> P: Continue Deployment  
  deactivate P
end
@enduml
```

In this diagram, the following sequence is defined:

1. The developer (D) requests the deployment of their application.
2. The deployment process (P) checks if their data set version is compatible with the shared data set instance (DS).
3. The shared data set instance (DS) takes care of matching versions internally.
4. The shared data set instance (DS) returns a status message to the deployment process (P) indicating whether the data set versions are compatible or not.
5. If they are not compatible, the deployment process (P) returns an error message "Version Conflict Error" to the developer (D) and stops the deployment.
6. If they are compatible, the deployment process (P) continues with the deployment.

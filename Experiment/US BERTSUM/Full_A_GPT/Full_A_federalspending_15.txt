As an AI model, I cannot generate diagrams. However, I will illustrate an example of how you can design a sequence diagram in a Plant UML wording format for your user story. 

The User Story: As an owner, I want to be sure that USAspending only sends grant records to my system.
Assuming the actors are: Owner, USAspending, System

1. The Owner initiates request to USAspending
2. USAspending pulls grant records from the database
3. USAspending sends grant records to the System
4. The System confirms the receipt of the grant records

This can be represented in PlantUml as:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Owner" as O
participant "USAspending" as U
database "Database" as D
participant "System" as S

O -> U: Request Grants
activate U
U -> D: Pull Grants
activate D
D --> U: Grant Records
deactivate D
U --> S: SendGrantRecords
activate S
S --> O: ConfirmReceipt
deactivate S
deactivate U
@enduml
```

You might need to adjust the diagram in terms of the actions and the actors based on the actual interactions in your system. This PlantUML code will result in a sequence diagram where the Owner requests Grant records from USAspending, USAspending communicates with the Database, and then USAspending sends the grant records to the System, and the System confirms the receipt to the Owner.

The Plant UML sequence diagram code for the given scenario can be expressed as follows:

```
@startuml
actor "Repository Manager" as RM
entity "System" as S
database "DAMS" as D

RM ->S: Request to access collections/objects
S -> D: Retrieve collections/objects for which RM is responsible
D --> S: Return access to collections/objects
S --> RM: Display collections/objects

RM ->S: Choose an object
S -> D: Retrieve object details
D --> S: Return object details
S --> RM: Display object details

RM ->S: Indicate Names
S -> D: Record Names related to the object
D --> S: Confirm Names recorded successfully
S --> RM: Confirmation of names being indicated

RM ->S: Indicate Role (illustrator, photographer, etc.)
S -> D: Record Role related to indicated names
D --> S: Confirm Role recorded successfully
S --> RM: Confirmation of role being indicated
@enduml
```

This diagram shows the sequence of interactions for the use case "As a repository manager, I want to indicate that a name pertinent to a collection, object, or object component has a specific role, such as illustrator, photographer, etc". It illustrates the communication between the repository manager, system, and DAMS database, from the actions of accessing collections/objects, indicating names, to assigning role for the names. 

Please run the given Plant UML codes in your desired/compatible applications or platforms to view the final sequence diagram image.

Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model developed by Open AI, I am unable to draw or encode diagrams directly. However, I can provide you with an example of how you could generate a sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax.

Here is a partial sample PlantUML script depicting a sequence of interactions between a LibraryMember, Book, LibrarySystem, and Librarian. This script assumes that the LibraryMember interacts with a LibrarySystem interface to order a book and then a Librarian executes the order.

Please note that this is quite a simple procedure, the complete diagram would need additional details and nuances based on the complexity of the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant LibraryMember
participant LibrarySystem
participant Librarian
participant Book

LibraryMember -> LibrarySystem: SearchBookByTitle(title)
activate LibrarySystem
LibrarySystem -> Book: getBookByTitle(title)
activate Book
Book --> LibrarySystem: bookDetails
deactivate Book
LibrarySystem --> LibraryMember: bookDetails
deactivate LibrarySystem
LibraryMember -> LibrarySystem: orderBook(bookDetails)
activate LibrarySystem
LibrarySystem -> Librarian: processBookOrder(bookDetails)
activate Librarian
Librarian --> LibrarySystem: OrderConfirmation
deactivate Librarian
LibrarySystem --> LibraryMember: OrderConfirmation
deactivate LibrarySystem
@enduml
```

The code above will create a sequence diagram where a library member searches for a book by title through the library system, then orders the book, and the librarian processes the book order. The library member then receives an order confirmation.

You can copy this PlantUML script and paste it into any PlantUML visualizing tools to see the diagram visualized. Remember to adjust it to match your actual necessary sequence and interactions.

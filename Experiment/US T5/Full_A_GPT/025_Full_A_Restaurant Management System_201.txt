In this Sequence Diagram, The manager initiates the process by requesting for the remaining items from the API Controller. The API Controller forwards this request to the Service Layer. The Service Layer then asks the Data Access Layer to fetch the required data. The Data Access Layer queries the Inventory Database and retrieves the remaining items list. This information is returned back to the Service Layer which forwards it to the API Controller. Finally, The API Controller presents the remaining items list to the Manager.

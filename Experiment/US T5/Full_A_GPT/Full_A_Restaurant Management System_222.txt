Generating a detailed Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the user story in the text would not be a suitable task for text-based AI, as UML diagrams are graphical in nature and require a visual device for designing and interpreting. However, I can provide you with a written framework for how that sequence diagram might look like:

1. "Manager" is the actor initiating the sequence by requesting to view reports.
2. This request goes to the "System" (which can be represented as a participant, object, or component in UML).
3. The "System" then communicates with the "Database" (another participant) to fetch the requested information.
4. The "Database" provides the fetched data back to the "System"
5. The "System" processes the data into the required report format.
6. Finally, the "System" provides these reports back to the "Manager".

The above can be represented using Plant UML syntax as below:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant System
database Database

Manager -> System : Request to view reports
System -> Database : Fetch order information
Database -> System : Return fetched data
System -> System : Process fetched data
System -> Manager : Return processed reports
@enduml
```

This is a very rough and basic framework of such a sequence diagram based on the given user story. Depending on the actual specifics of the system, there could be further participants and interactions, possibly more detailed steps in data fetching and processing, and so on.

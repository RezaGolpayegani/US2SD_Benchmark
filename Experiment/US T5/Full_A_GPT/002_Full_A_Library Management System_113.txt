This is a text representation of how a sequence diagram might look for your given user story. Please note since text interaction is limited, you will need to use a tool that supports Plantuml to visualize the actual diagram. Here's an example of how it could look:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Manager" as LM
participant "Library System" as LS
participant "Database" as DB

LM -> LS: Request to Assign ID to Book
activate LS
LS -> DB: Check if book exists
activate DB
DB --> LS: Book found
deactivate DB
LS -> DB: Request to Generate Unique ID
activate DB
DB --> LS: Unique ID Generated
deactivate DB
LS -> LM: Display Unique ID
deactivate LS
@enduml
```
In this scenario:

- The "Library Manager" requests to assign a unique ID to a book.
- The "Library System" checks if the book exists in the "Database".
- The "Database" confirms the book exists.
- The "Library System" requests the "Database" to generate a unique ID.
- The "Database" generates a unique ID and returns it to the "Library System".
- The "Library System" displays the unique ID to the "Library Manager".

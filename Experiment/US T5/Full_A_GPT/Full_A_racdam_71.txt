Here's a simple sequence diagram in Plant UML format based on the user story. Use an online or offline PlantUML tool to visualize the diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
note over Researcher 
  Researcher is interested in cross-collection citation information 
  and wants to reference it accurately. In the system, we assume 
  that the citation information is already linked to its electronic 
  versions by Assistant Archivists.
end note

Researcher -> Database: request citation information
Database -> CitationCollection: ask for citation information
CitationCollection -> Citation: get information
Citation --> CitationCollection: return detailed information
CitationCollection --> Database: relay information
Database --> Researcher: respond with citation information

note right of Researcher 
  It's implied in the user story that the process ends with 
  researcher ensuring the accuracy and recording citation for future 
  use.
end note

This diagram follows a simple process where a researcher requests a citation from a database. The database requests information from the citation collection and in turn, the citation collection fetches the requested information from the individual citation. The information is then relayed back through the system to the researcher.


You can expand this sequence diagram based on the actual system involving user authentication, error checks, etc.

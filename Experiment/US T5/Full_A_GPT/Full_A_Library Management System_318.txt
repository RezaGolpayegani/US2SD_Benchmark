We are unable to generate diagrams or images. However, we can guide you on how to construct a sequence diagram in Plant UML based on "As a reader, I want to comment on books". The diagram will illustrate interactions between objects in your system over time. 

```
@startuml

title Comment on Books Sequence Diagram

actor Reader
participant "Comment System" as C
participant "Book" as B

Reader -> C: writeComment(commentText, bookId)
activate C
C -> B: addComment(commentText)
activate B
B --> C: commentAddedAcknowledge()
C --> Reader: displayAcknowledge()
deactivate B
deactivate C

@enduml
```

The sequence diagram starts with the "Reader" who interacts with the "Comment System" by writing a comment. "Comment System" then communicates with "Book" to add the comment. Once the comment is added, "Book" sends an acknowledgment back to the "Comment System" which then further displays an acknowledgment to the "Reader". 

Please replace `commentText` and `bookId` with the actual comment and bookId input fields respectively. Adjust this according to your system's architecture; this is a high-level template. 

You can convert this PlantUML code into an image or visualization using a PlantUML compiler online.

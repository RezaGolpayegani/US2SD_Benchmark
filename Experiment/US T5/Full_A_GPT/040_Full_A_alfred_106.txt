To create a sequence diagram for the user story described above requires understanding the interaction between the components in this scenario. Here is a plausible sequence:

1. OlderPerson activates ALFRED.
2. ALFRED listens and identifies command.
3. ALFRED processes the command and fetches info on how to reduce health impairments without medication.
4. ALFRED delivers the useful tips through speech (for visually impaired users) or on a screen (for deaf users).

The PlantUML code for this sequence diagram could be something like this:

@startuml
title Tip Providing Sequence
participant "OlderPerson" as p
participant "ALFRED" as a

p -> a: Activate ALFRED
activate a
a <-- p: Speak/Illustrate Command for Health tips
note right: ALFRED identifies and processes command.
a -> a: Fetch tips to reduce health impairment
note right: Info usually fetched from stored database or Internet
a --> p: Deliver health tips (Speech/Screen)
deactivate a
@enduml

This sequence diagram will explain the interaction between the user (OlderPerson) and the ALFRED device. It's important to note that the functionality of fetching tips from the Internet is implied and may require additional components like a database or an Internet connection. Other parts of the implementation, like error checking or handling multiple users, aren't included in this simplified overview. 

Additionally, the choice of tips delivery method (i.e., speech or visual) depends on the user's requirements and capabilities. A comprehensive solution would involve designing the device to adapt to the user's preferences and needs.

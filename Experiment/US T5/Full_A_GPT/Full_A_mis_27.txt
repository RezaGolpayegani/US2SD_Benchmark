You can see the sample sequence diagram in the Plant UML format below:

```plantuml
@startuml

activate C
C --> A: Group Created
A -> C: Add Person to Group
C --> A: Person Added
A -> C: Remove Person from Group
C --> A: Person Removed
deactivate C

A -> B: Set Deposit Window Close Date
B --> A: Date Set
B -> P: Confer Default Permissions
P --> B: Permissions Confirmed

This diagram describes the sequence of the operations:

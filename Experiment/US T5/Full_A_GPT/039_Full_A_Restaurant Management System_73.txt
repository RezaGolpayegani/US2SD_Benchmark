Since formatting the PlantUML code in plain text might be hard to read, we will define the sequence of interactions in ordered steps. Following is a sample sequence diagram in textual format.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Viewing Menu Sequence Diagram

autonumber

actor Customer
participant "Menu System" as Menu

Customer -> Menu: Request Menu
activate Menu
Menu -> Database: Query Menu Items
activate Database

note right: Database finds \nthe requested menu items

Database --> Menu: Return Menu Details
deactivate Database
Menu --> Customer : Display Menu Details
deactivate Menu
@enduml
```
In this diagram:

1. The process starts when a 'Customer' executes a 'Request Menu' to 'Menu System', which goes to the 'Database'.
2. The 'Menu System' sends a 'Query Menu Items' to the 'Database'.
3. The 'Database' finds the requested menu items and initiates the 'Return Menu Details' back to the 'Menu System'.
4. Then, the 'Menu System' displays the menu details back to the 'Customer'.

Please note, this is a simplified view of the sequence diagram for viewing a menu. Other factors might need to be included in a real-world application, like error handling and security.

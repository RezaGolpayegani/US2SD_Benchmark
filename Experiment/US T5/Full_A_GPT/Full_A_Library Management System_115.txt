Here is a sequence diagram written in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml
actor Librarian
entity "Library System" as system
database "Book Records Database" as bookDB

Librarian -> system: login()
activate system
system --> Librarian: showDashboard()

Librarian -> system: startNewBookEntry()
activate system
system -> bookDB: createNewRecord()
activate bookDB
bookDB --> system: generateNewRecordID()
deactivate bookDB
system --> Librarian: displayBookEntryForm(newRecordID)

Librarian -> system: inputBookInfo(bookInfo)
activate system
system -> bookDB: saveBookInfo(bookInfo)
activate bookDB
bookDB --> system: confirmationOfSaving()
deactivate bookDB
system --> Librarian: showConfirmation()

Librarian -> system: logout()
deactivate system
@enduml
``` 

This sequence diagram represents the process of a library manager creating a book record. The flow starts with the librarian logging into the system. Once logged in, the librarian requests to add a new book entry. The system interacts with the book records database to create a new record and generate an ID for it. The book entry form is displayed to the librarian with the new record ID. The librarian inputs the information of the new book. The system saves this new book information in the book records database. After the process is completed, the librarian logs out.

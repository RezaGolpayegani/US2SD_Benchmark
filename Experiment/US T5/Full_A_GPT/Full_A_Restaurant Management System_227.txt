Here is a simplified example of a PlantUML sequence diagram for this User Story.

```plantuml
autonumber
actor User 
boundary "Front End Application" as FEA
control "Back End Application" as BEA
database "Order Database" as ODB

User -> FEA : RequestAllActiveOrders()
FEA -> BEA : GetAllActiveOrders()
BEA -> ODB : FetchAllActiveOrders()
ODB --> BEA : ActiveOrderData(order_start_date, ...)
BEA --> FEA : AllActiveOrderList(order_start_date, ...)
FEA --> User : ShowAllActiveOrders()
```

In this sequence diagram:

1. The User requests to see all active orders from the Front End Application (FEA).
2. The FEA sends a request to get all active orders to the Back End Application (BEA).
3. The BEA communicates with the Order Database (ODB) to fetch all the active orders information.
4. The ODB returns all the active orders data back to the BEA.
5. The BEA then sends this data, arranged in order of the order start dates, back to the FEA.
6. Finally, the FEA shows all the active orders to the User.

Remember this is a simplified version of the sequence, the real sequence could be more complex depending on the system architecture, database design, security steps and more factors.

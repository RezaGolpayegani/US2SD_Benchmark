As an AI, I'm sorry I am not able to generate diagrams but I can provide you with a textual description of what the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for the mentioned User Story would look like:

Below is the sequence diagram depicted using textual UML format.

```UML
@startuml
participant "Data Librarian" as D
participant "Data Management Plan (DMP)" as P
participant "Other Systems" as O
participant "Data Catalogue" as C

D -> P : Request pointers to metadata
activate P
P -> O : Extract metadata
activate O
O -->> P : Returns metadata
deactivate O
P -->> D : Sends pointers to metadata
deactivate P
D -> C : Import metadata
activate C
C -->> D : Confirm import
deactivate C
@enduml
```

Starting with the Data Librarian who requests pointers to metadata from the Data Management Plan (DMP). The DMP then extracts this metadata from "Other Systems". These systems return the required metadata back to the DMP, which then sends the pointers to the metadata back to the Data Librarian. The Librarian then imports this metadata into the "Data Catalogue" which finally confirms the import back to the Librarian. 

Note: The direction of arrows indicates the flow of action starting from the request until it reaches the confirmation of the import.

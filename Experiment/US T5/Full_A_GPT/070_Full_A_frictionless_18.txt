Here is a simple example of how you could describe this process in PlantUML format. In this scenario, it is assumed that the Developer interacts with a DataPackageManager or similar system to access and load the Data Package.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "DataPackageManager" as DPM

activate Developer
Developer -> DPM: requestPackage(packageID)
activate DPM
DPM --> Developer: returnPackage(packageData)
deactivate DPM
note over Developer: Developer starts using the data \n for analysis and visualization
@enduml
```

In the above script:
- The Developer sends a request to the DataPackageManager with the specific 'packageID' of the Data Package they want to access.
- The DataPackageManager returns the requested Data Package data to the Developer.
- A note indicates the Developer's action after receiving the data. 

Remember: In a real application, the process may include more steps and interactions, depending on the features and complexity of your system. Please modify this diagram as per your software application or system model.

As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to create visual content or diagrams. However, I can provide you with the necessary plantUML language to represent a sequence diagram for that user story. Please adapt the following idea for your own needs;

Consider this is a conversation between the API User, API Service, Database, and Data Processing Service:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor APIUser
participant APIService
participant DataProcessingService
database Database

APIUser -> APIService: Request(normalise measures by GINI and related indexes, dataset_id)
APIService -> Database: FetchDataset(dataset_id)
Database --> APIService: Dataset(dataset)
APIService -> DataProcessingService: NormaliseDataset(dataset, 'GINI', 'related indexes')
DataProcessingService --> APIService: NormalisedData
APIService --> APIUser: Response(NormalisedData)

@enduml
```
This diagram represents an API User sending a request to normalize measures by GINI and related indexes for a particular dataset. The API Service fetches the required dataset from the Database, then passes it to a Data Processing Service for normalization. The Data Processing Service processes the request and returns the normalized data to the API Service, which then sends it back to the API User as the response.

Remember, you need to install a PlantUML viewer to see the actual diagram from this text description. Note, the above sequence may vary based on your specific implementation and organisation of microservices or modules, so adapt as needed.

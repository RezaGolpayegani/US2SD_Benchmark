Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate diagrams or visual content. However, I can definitely help in describing the sequence diagram in a narrative manner, which you can later translate into Plant UML format using an appropriate tool.

Please note that sequence diagrams typically spotlight system behavior during interactions in a sequential format on how objects interact over time. Here's a textual sequence diagram for the User Story:

1. OlderPerson interacts with the Alfred system: `OlderPerson -> Alfred: interact`.
   
2. Alfred system detects the OlderPerson's interaction: `Alfred -> Alfred: detect_interaction`.

3. Alfred system enters listening mode only when asked by the OlderPerson: `Alfred -> Alfred: enable_listening_mode`.
   
4. OlderPerson provides voice command to Alfred: `OlderPerson -> Alfred: voice_command("change shirt")`.
   
5. Alfred system processes the voice command: `Alfred -> Alfred: process_voice_command`.
   
6. Alfred system validates the command: `Alfred -> Alfred: validate_command`.
   
7. If the command is valid, Alfred changes its appearance to be non stigmatizing: `Alfred -> Alfred: change_appearance("non stigmatizing shirt")`.

8. Alfred system gives feedback to OlderPerson about the change: `Alfred -> OlderPerson: feedback("Shirt changed successfully")`.

Please consult with your project team or mentor to correctly implement this sequence in your specific use case and to ensure that the steps convey the necessary process for ALFRED to operate optimally.

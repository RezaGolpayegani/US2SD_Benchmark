Here is the PlantUML code for that sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor "Researcher" as r
participant "System" as s
participant "Database" as d

r -> s: Start Logbook Page Creation
activate s

s -> d: Fetch Template
activate d

d --> s: Return Template
deactivate d

s --> r: Show Template

r -> s: Fill Template, Attach File
activate s

s -> d: Store Logbook Page and File
activate d

d --> s: Confirm Storage
deactivate d

s --> r: Confirm Page Creation
deactivate s

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the researcher interacts with the system to start the creation of a log book page. The system fetches a template from the database and presents it to the researcher. The researcher fills in the template and attaches a file, sending this information back to the system. The system then stores the logbook page and file in the database. Once storage is confirmed, the system sends a confirmation to the researcher.

Please note: As PlantUML doesn't support the visualization of file handling (like file upload), this is visualized as information being sent to the system.

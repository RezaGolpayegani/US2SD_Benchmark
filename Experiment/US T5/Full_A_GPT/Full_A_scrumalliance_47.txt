Here is the PlantUML code to generate your sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor SiteAdmin
entity SiteDB
SiteAdmin -> SiteDB: Request help wanted ad lists
activate SiteDB
SiteDB -> SiteAdmin: Return help wanted ad lists
deactivate SiteDB
note over SiteAdmin: SiteAdmin choose an ad to edit
SiteAdmin -> SiteDB: Request to edit selected help wanted ad
activate SiteDB
SiteDB -> SiteAdmin: Return editable fields of selected ad
deactivate SiteDB
note over SiteAdmin: SiteAdmin edit and save changes
SiteAdmin -> SiteDB: Send edited ad details
activate SiteDB
SiteDB --> SiteAdmin: Acknowledge changes
deactivate SiteDB
note over SiteAdmin: SiteAdmin choose an ad to delete
SiteAdmin -> SiteDB: Request to delete selected help wanted ad
activate SiteDB
SiteDB --> SiteAdmin: Acknowledge deletion
deactivate SiteDB
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, it shows the interaction between the Site Admin and a hypothetical Site Database (SiteDB) when editing and deleting help wanted ads.

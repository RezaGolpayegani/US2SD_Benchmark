I'm an AI text-based model, I can't create diagrams. However, I can describe how the sequence diagram could be constructed:

Start from User as "Trainee":
1. Trainee : Sign In -> Authentication System
2. Authentication System: Validate User -> Database
3. Database : User Details -> Authentication System
4. Authentication System: Verified User -> Trainee
5. Trainee: View Training Schedule -> Training System
6. Training System: Get Schedule -> Database
7. Database : Return Schedule -> Training System
8. Training System: Display Schedule -> Trainee
9. Trainee : Select Class for Registration -> Training System
10. Training System: Check Registration limit (1/day per user) -> Database
11. Database : Return Registration count -> Training System
12. Training System: Registration Confirmation/Denial -> Trainee
If confirmed, Registration details would be saved in the Database.
   
You can use the above sequence to draw a sequence diagram. In terms of Plant UML it would look something like the following by default:

```
@startuml
actor Trainee
database Database
participant "Authentication System" as auth
participant "Training System" as train

Trainee -> auth : Sign In
auth -> Database : Validate User
Database -> auth : User Details
auth -> Trainee : Verified User
Trainee -> train : View Training Schedule
train -> Database : Get Schedule
Database -> train : Return Schedule
train -> Trainee : Display Schedule
Trainee -> train : Select Class for Registration
train -> Database : Check Registration limit (1/day per user)
Database -> train : Return Registration count
train -> Trainee : Registration Confirmation/Denial

You can use this code as a starting point and refine according to your customization needs.

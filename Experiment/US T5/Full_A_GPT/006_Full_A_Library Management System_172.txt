Since it's not possible to draw diagrams via text, I will describe the Plant UML sequence diagram and show how to write in code for the user story: "As a library member, I want to reserve more than one book."

First, there are four main objects interacting: "LibraryMember", "LibrarySystem", "Book" and "LibraryDatabase".

1. The "LibraryMember" starts the interaction requesting to the "LibrarySystem" to reserve a book.
2. The "LibrarySystem" sends a request to the "LibraryDatabase" to check if the book is available.
3. The "LibraryDatabase" returns the availability status of the book to the "LibrarySystem".
4. If the book is available, the "LibrarySystem" sends another request to the "LibraryDatabase" to reserve the book under the "LibraryMember"'s account.
5. The "LibraryDatabase" reserves the book and sends a confirmation to the "LibrarySystem".
6. The "LibrarySystem" sends the reservation confirmation back to the "LibraryMember".

This process is repeated for each book that the Library Member wants to reserve.

Here is the PlantUML code for the above sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor LibraryMember
participant LibrarySystem
database LibraryDatabase
entity Book

LibraryMember -> LibrarySystem: Request to reserve a book
activate LibrarySystem
LibrarySystem -> LibraryDatabase: Check book availability
activate LibraryDatabase
LibraryDatabase --> LibrarySystem: Return book availability
deactivate LibraryDatabase
alt Book is available
LibrarySystem -> LibraryDatabase: Reserve book for member
activate LibraryDatabase
LibraryDatabase --> LibrarySystem: Confirm book reservation
deactivate LibraryDatabase
LibrarySystem --> LibraryMember: Confirm book reservation
else Book is unavailable
LibrarySystem --> LibraryMember: Inform book unavailability
end
deactivate LibrarySystem

This diagram can be generated using any tool that supports Plant UML, such as PlantText, IntelliJ IDEA with the PlantUML plugin, etc. Just copy and paste the above code into one of those tools to generate the sequence diagram.

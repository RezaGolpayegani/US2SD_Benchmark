Here is a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the given user story:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "Julia System" as JS
database "Data Package" as DP

Researcher -> JS: Request(Data Package)
activate JS
JS -> DP: Fetch(Data Package)
activate DP
DP --> JS: Return(Data Package)
deactivate DP
JS --> Researcher: Return(Data Package)
deactivate JS

Researcher -> JS: Start(Analysis and visualizations)
activate JS
Researcher <-- JS: Return(Visualizations)
deactivate JS
@enduml
```
This diagram describes the interaction between a Researcher, the Julia System, and the Data Package. The Researcher requests the Data Package from the Julia System which then fetches the required Data Package from its storage. Once the Data Package is retrieved, it is returned to the Researcher through the Julia System. The Researcher then initiates the Analysis and Visualization process on the Julia System, which starts processing the data and eventually returns the Visualizations back to the Researcher. The sequence diagram assumes the Julia systemâ€™s ability to fetch a Data Package from a storage entity and its capability to perform Analysis and Visualizations.

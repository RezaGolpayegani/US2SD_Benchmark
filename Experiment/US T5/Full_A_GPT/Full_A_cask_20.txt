Based on the User Story provided in the project description, I'd advise providing a simple and understandable Sequence Diagram. In PlantUML, you could design it as follows:

```@startuml
title User - Dataset Type & Instance Sequence Diagram

actor "Dataset Developer" as Developer
participant "Dataset Type" as DType
participant "App" as App
participant "Dataset Instance" as DInstance

Developer -> DType: Explore dataset type
activate DType 
DType -> DType: Deploy dataset type
note right: Dataset type is deployed independently.

DType -->Developer: Report dataset type deployed
note left: Developer acknowledges deployment of dataset type.

Developer -> DInstance: Create dataset instance from deployed type
activate DInstance
DInstance --> Developer : Dataset instance created
note right: Dataset instance is created and explored.

```

This sequence diagram begins by showing the interaction between the "Dataset Developer" and "Dataset Type", where the developer explores the dataset type that is deployed independently. Once deployed, the "Dataset Type" sends a report back to the "Dataset Developer". The developer then interacts with "Dataset Instance" to create a dataset instance from the deployed type. Once the instance is created, a report is sent back to the developer. This scenarios conclude the illustrated process.

Remember, this is a rudimentary scenario. Hand-tailor your diagram as necessary to reflect the complexity and specifics of your project requirements.

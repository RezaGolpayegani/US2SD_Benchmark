Unfortunately, I'm not able to generate diagrams due to the limitations of text-based format here. But, I can provide the PlantUML code for the sequence diagram based on your user story. 

Here's the sequence diagram in PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Library Management System: Sort and Filter Search Results

actor Member
boundary "Search UI" as UI
control "Search Controller" as SC
database "Book Database" as DB

Member -> UI : Searches for books
UI -> SC : Sends search query
SC -> DB : Sends search query
DB -> DB : Fetches relevant books
DB --> SC : Returns search results
SC --> UI : Displays Search results
Member -> UI : Sorts/ Filters results

note left 
Member can sort or filter results 
based on different parameters such as 
book author, publication year, genre, etc.
end note

UI -> SC : Sends sorted/ filtered request
SC -> DB : Sends sorted/ filtered request
DB -> DB : Sorts/ Filters books
DB --> SC : Returns sorted/ filtered results
SC --> UI : Displays sorted/ filtered results

You can copy this code and paste into any PlantUML editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

This diagram assumes that the Member interacts with a "Search UI" to input their search query. This query is then sent to a "Search Controller", which interacts with the "Book Database" to fetch the relevant books. The search results are returned to the Member via the "Search UI". The Member then uses the same "Search UI" to sort and filter these search results, and these sorted/ filtered results are again fetched from the "Book Database" and displayed to the Member via the "Search UI".

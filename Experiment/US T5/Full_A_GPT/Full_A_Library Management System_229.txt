Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model, I can't create visual diagrams directly. But I can give you an example of a sequence diagram in PlantUML base on your description:

```
@startuml
actor Librarian
participant "BookDatabase" as BD
entity Manager

Librarian -> BD: addBook(newBook)
activate BD
BD --> Librarian: confirmAddition
deactivate BD

Librarian -> BD: getMonthlyAddedBooks()
activate BD
BD --> Librarian: returnMonthlyAddedBooks
deactivate BD

Librarian -> Manager: sendMonthlyAddedBooksReport()
activate Manager
Manager --> Librarian: acknowledgeReceipt
deactivate Manager
@enduml
```

In this example:

- The Librarian adds a new book to the BookDatabase.
- The BookDatabase confirms the addition of the new book.
- The Librarian then requests information on all books added within the month from the BookDatabase.
- The BookDatabase returns this information.
- The Librarian sends this as a report to the Manager.
- The Manager confirms receipt of the report.

This is a simplifying example, you may need to fit it to your exact needs.

Sure, here is a detailed sequence diagram code in PlantUML for the user story "As a waiter, I want to view the menu":

```PlantUML
@startuml
title View Menu Sequence Diagram

actor Waiter
participant "Menu System" as MS

Waiter -> MS : Request Menu
activate MS
MS --> Waiter : Send Menu
deactivate MS

@enduml
```

This is a simple sequence diagram. It starts with the Waiter sending a request to the Menu System for the Menu. Then, the Menu System responds back to the Waiter by sending the Menu.

Note: You need to copy this code and run it in any PlantUML editor to visualize the sequence diagram.

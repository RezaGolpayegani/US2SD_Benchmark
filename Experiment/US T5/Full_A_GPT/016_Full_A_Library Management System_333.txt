Below is the sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the user story "As a staff, I want to checkout a book, so that I can keep track of books after reservation".

Code:

```
@startuml
participant "Staff" as S
participant "System" as SY
participant "Database" as DB

activate S
S -> SY : select book for checkout
activate SY
SY -> DB : retrieve book details
activate DB
Db --> SY : return book details
deactivate DB
SY --> S : display book details
S -> SY : confirm checkout
SY -> DB : update book record to 'checked out'
activate DB
DB --> SY : confirm success 
deactivate DB
SY --> S : display checkout confirmation
deactivate SY
@enduml
```

Explanation:

- The sequence starts with the "Staff" initiating the process by selecting a book for checkout. 
- The "System" then retrieves the book details from the "Database".
- The "Database" returns the book details to the "System".
- The "System" displays the book details to the "Staff".
- The "Staff" confirms the checkout, and the "System" updates the book record to 'checked out' in the "Database".
- Upon success confirmation from the "Database", the "System" displays checkout confirmation to the "Staff". This marks the end of the sequence.

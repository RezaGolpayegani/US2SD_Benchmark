As an AI, I'm unable to create the sequence diagram directly, but I can certainly guide you on how you can create one using Plant UML format based on your user story.

First, let's consider the main interactions involved: 

1. The Data Publishing User chooses to import data from a Google Spreadsheet 
2. The system prompts the user to login to their Google account.
3. After a successful login, the system fetches the Google Spreadsheet data.
4. The system converts the data to the required format.
5. The converted data is then loaded into the data packager.
6. The Data Publishing User receives confirmation of successful import.

Now, let's translate these steps into PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Data Publishing User" as DPU
boundary "System" as SYS

DPU -> SYS : Choose to import data
SYS -> DPU : Login to Google Account
DPU -> SYS : Successful Login

activate SYS

SYS -> SYS : Fetch Google Spreadsheet Data
SYS -> SYS : Data Conversion
SYS -> SYS : Load converted data into the Data Packager

deactivate SYS

SYS -> DPU : Confirmation of Successful Import

```

This PlantUML sequence diagram simply demonstrates the flow and interaction of the system and the Data Publishing User. Please make sure to adjust according to your specific needs.

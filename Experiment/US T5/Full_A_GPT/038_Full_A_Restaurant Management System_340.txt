Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to generate graphical diagrams or sequence diagrams in Plant UML directly. However, I can give you an example of what the Plant UML code might look like for your scenario. Please see the example below:

```
@startuml
actor Employee
participant OrderSystem

Employee --> OrderSystem : Input Order 
activate OrderSystem 
OrderSystem -> Employee : Request Details 
deactivate OrderSystem

Employee --> OrderSystem : Enter Order Details 
activate OrderSystem 
OrderSystem -> Employee : Request Confirmation 
deactivate OrderSystem

Employee --> OrderSystem : Confirm Details 

activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem --> Employee : Save Order Details 
deactivate OrderSystem

Employee --> OrderSystem: Input Notes to Order
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem -> Employee: Request Confirmation for Notes
deactivate OrderSystem

Employee --> OrderSystem: Confirm Notes
activate OrderSystem
OrderSystem --> Employee: Save Notes to Order
deactivate OrderSystem

```

This code describes the sequence of interactions between an employee and the order system to input order details and notes to an order. Please adapt it to your actual use case.

Unfortunately, an AI can't create a visual sequence diagram but I can provide you with a rough description of how a sequence diagram for your user story might look in Plant UML format.

```plantuml
title User game interaction with ALFRED

actor OlderPerson
participant ALFRED as A

OlderPerson -> A: Request game
activate A
A -> A: Choose game
A --> OlderPerson: Display game rules
deactivate A

OlderPerson -> A: Confirm to start game 
activate A 
A -> A: Start game 

loop Game Play
    OlderPerson -> A: Play game step
    note left: Each step might be a memory or physical task.

    A -> A: Validate step
    A --> OlderPerson: Feedback on step
end

A --> OlderPerson: Display game result.
deactivate A
```

This sequence diagram starts with OlderPerson making a request to ALFRED for a game. ALFRED then chooses an appropriate game based on the user and displays the game rules. The user confirms they want to start the game, and the game begins. The game play consists of a loop where the user performs a step, ALFRED validates the step, and gives feedback. Once the game play is over, ALFRED displays the game result.

This is a very basic sequence diagram. The actual sequence may vary based on the details of the games being designed for the ALFRED device. This sequence diagram does not take into account error conditions and alternative paths. It should be further expanded and tailored to your specific project requirements.

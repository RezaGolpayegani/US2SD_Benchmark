Sorry for misunderstanding, but generating Sequence Diagrams in Plant UML format would require a visual coding platform and extensive information on the specifics of the system, user roles, interactions, processes, etc. However, I can create a simple text-based version of what this might looks like:

```plain
@startuml
participant "FABS User" as F1
participant "System" as S
participant "Error Handler" as E

F1 -> S: Initiates submission
S -> S: Checks for errors
alt Submission Errors
  S -> E: Pass error detail
  E -> E: Maps submission error to FABS Error
  E --> F1: Display FABS Error message
else No Submission Errors
  S --> F1: Confirm submission successful
end 
@enduml
```

This basic idea of the sequence follows the steps mentioned in the user story. The FABS user initiates a submission. System checks for errors. If any submission error is found, it passes it to an Error Handler, which then maps it to a FABS specific type and returns an error message to the User. If no errors are found, a success message is returned.

Please note that a more detailed and accurate sequence diagram would largely depend on your system architecture and design.

I am an AI and currently unable to create visual graphical diagrams, but I can certainly guide you through creating a sequence diagram using Plant UML syntax. For the user story provided, here's an example of how you can represent it:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Anonymous User" as A
participant "System" as S
participant "Database" as D

A -> S : Request list of summits
activate S
S -> D : Retrieve summit info
activate D
D --> S : Return summit info
deactivate D
S --> A : Display summit info
deactivate S
@enduml
```

In this scenario:

- The "Anonymous User" requests the list of summits from the "System."
- The "System" then sends a request to the "Database" to retrieve the summit information.
- Upon retrieval, the "Database" returns the summit information to the "System."
- Finally, the "System" displays the summit information to the "Anonymous User."

Please consider drawing this on your preferred UML tool.

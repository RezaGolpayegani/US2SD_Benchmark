Sure, here is the rough sequence in Plant UML syntax for the described user story. Note, I am providing a textual depiction assuming there's no medium to represent the actual diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
title "Specify Unique ID Number for Each Book"
participant Staff
participant "Book Database" as DB

Staff -> DB: Access book records
DB -> Staff: Show book records

loop for each new book
    Staff -> DB: Assign Unique ID
    DB -> Staff: Confirm Assignment
end
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a staff member and the book database. For each new book, the staff member assigns a unique ID, which is confirmed by the database.

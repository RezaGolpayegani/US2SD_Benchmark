Below is a sample sequence diagram in PlantUML for the user story:

```puml
@startuml
title Book Borrow Due Date Lookup

actor Member
participant "Book system" as BS
database LibraryDB

Member -> BS : Check book status(book_id)
activate BS
BS -> LibraryDB : retrieveBookStatus(book_id)
activate LibraryDB
LibraryDB --> BS : BookStatus
deactivate LibraryDB
BS --> Member : BookStatus (including due date if borrowed)
deactivate BS
@enduml
```

In this Sequence Diagram :

- The member makes a request to check the book status by passing the book_id.
- The book system retrieves the book status from the library database.
- The library database then returns the information, including the book status, to the book system.
- Finally, the book system presents the information, which includes the due date if the book has been borrowed, to the Member.

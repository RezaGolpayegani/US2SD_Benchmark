As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am incapable of directly creating diagrams. However, I can provide a verbal description of how you might create a Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format for your User Story based on the project description. 

Below is a simplified textual representation of what might go into this diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Project Management Application

actor LibraryStaff

entity ProjectManagementApplication

database MetadataDatabase

LibraryStaff --> ProjectManagementApplication : Request customizable fields
activate ProjectManagementApplication

ProjectManagementApplication --> MetadataDatabase : Retrieve data fields
activate MetadataDatabase

MetadataDatabase --> ProjectManagementApplication : Return data fields
deactivate MetadataDatabase

ProjectManagementApplication --> LibraryStaff : Display data fields
deactivate ProjectManagementApplication

LibraryStaff --> ProjectManagementApplication : Customize data fields
activate ProjectManagementApplication

ProjectManagementApplication --> MetadataDatabase : Update customized fields
activate MetadataDatabase

MetadataDatabase --> ProjectManagementApplication : Save changes
deactivate MetadataDatabase

ProjectManagementApplication --> LibraryStaff : Confirm changes
deactivate ProjectManagementApplication

@enduml
```
This sequence starts with the library staff requesting the customization of fields from the Project Management Application. The application then retrieves the current fields for the project from the Metadata Database. After returning the fields to the library staff, the library staff member can then customize these fields and save the changes through the application. The application stores these changes in the MetadataDatabase and returns a confirmation to the library staff member.

Please note that the diagram is simplified. You may have more interactions and system components in your project. The description you gave for the project includes the use of Symplectic Elements and Activity Insight systems, notifications, and workflows. Depending on how you design the system, these components might interact with others. Please customize this sequence diagram to match your system design.

Sequence diagrams illustrate how objects interact with each other in a particular scenario of a software system.

Here is an example in PlantUML format for the mentioned user story:

``` 
@startuml
title Upload Data and Associate it with a Publication

actor Faculty 
entity Repository 
entity NotificationService 
entity PublicationService 

Faculty -> Repository: Upload Data
activate Repository

Repository -> PublicationService: Associate with Publication
activate PublicationService

PublicationService --> Repository: Data Associated
deactivate PublicationService

Repository --> Faculty: Show Uploaded and Associated Data
deactivate Repository

Faculty -> Repository: Verify Uploaded Data
activate Repository

Repository --> Faculty: Display Verification Message
deactivate Repository

alt if Someone Downloads Data
  Repository -> NotificationService: Trigger Notification
  activate NotificationService

  NotificationService --> Faculty: Send Download Notification
  deactivate NotificationService
end

@enduml
```

This language is designed to provide a description of objects interaction over time. The "actor Faculty" indicates the user of the system. The "->" symbol represents interactions such as method calls from one object to another. The "activate" keyword is used to focus on the object that is currently active or executed. The "-->" symbol represents responses from one object to another. The "deactivate" keyword is used to remove the focus from the object. The "alt" keyword is used to define alternatives to a base sequence.

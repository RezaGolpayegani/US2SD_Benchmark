Here is the detailed sequence diagram for the User Story in PlantUML format:

```
@startuml

actor Consumer
participant "Consumer\nInterface" as CI
participant "System\nInterface" as SI
participant "Publisher\nDatabase" as PD
participant Publisher

Consumer -> CI : Request to view Publisher's profile
activate CI
CI -> SI : Get publisher details
activate SI
SI -> PD : Fetch publisher data
activate PD
PD --> SI : Returns publisher data
deactivate PD
SI --> CI : Provide publisher details
deactivate SI
CI --> Consumer : Display Publisher's profile
deactivate CI

Consumer -> CI : Request to view Publisher's packages
activate CI
CI -> SI : Get publisher packages
activate SI
SI -> PD : Fetch publisher packages
activate PD
PD --> SI : Returns publisher packages
deactivate PD
SI --> CI : Provide publisher packages
deactivate SI
CI --> Consumer : Display Publisher's packages

This flow assumes that there are frontend interfaces (Consumer Interface, System Interface) before the actual backend (Publisher Database). The consumer first, requests to view the publisher's profile, which passes through the frontend interfaces to fetch the publisher's details from the publisher's database. The details are then displayed to the consumer. The same process is followed to fetch and display the publisher's packages to the consumer.

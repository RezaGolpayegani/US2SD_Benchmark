Please note that as a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to export diagrams. However, I am capable of drawing up the desired UML in standard PlantUML language, which you can then use in your favored UML editor or IDE to print the sequence diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer as dev

box "App Deployment Service" #LightBlue
    participant "AppDeploymentManager" as adm
end box

box "App Artifact" #Orange
    participant "App1" as a1
    participant "App2" as a2
end box

box "Dataset Instance" #LightPink
    participant "DataSetInstance"  as dsi
end box

box "Database" #Grey
    participant "Database" as db
end box

dev -> adm : Deploy App1 with new Dataset Type 
activate adm
adm -> a1 : Initialize Dataset Type 
activate a1
a1 -> dsi : Create Instance
activate dsi
dsi --> a1 : Return Instance 
deactivate dsi
a1 --> adm : Return Instance 
deactivate a1

adm -> db : Check Dataset Type compatibility
activate db
db --> adm : Return compatibility fail (version conflict)
deactivate db
adm --> dev : Return Deployment fail (version conflict)
deactivate adm
@enduml
```

Above script generates a sequence diagram between Developer, AppDeploymentManager, App1, DatasetInstance, and Database for the given user story. The exchange shows an unsuccessful app deployment due to a dataset version conflict. 

Please copy the provided PlantUML code to your favoured UML editor to generate the sequence diagram.

Sorry, I can't provide the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format directly in text format because it's visual, but I can guide you through the steps to create it:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant OrderManagementSystem as System
database OrderDatabase as Database

Manager -> System : Request to view orders
activate System

System -> Database : Retrieves orders
activate Database

Database --> System: Sends orders back
deactivate Database

System --> Manager: Display orders
deactivate System

@enduml
```

In this diagram, it starts with the `Manager` who requests to view orders from the `OrderManagementSystem`. `OrderManagementSystem` then retrieves these orders from `OrderDatabase` and gets a response back. Finally, it displays the received orders back to the `Manager`.

Be sure to maintain appropriate spacing while writing the code. Also, replace the spaces within each action with underscore (_). Otherwise, the Plant UML interpreters might not be able to read the code correctly.

This is a simple sequence diagram and you might need to modify based on the actual classes and operations in your application. Thanks!

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to create Sequence Diagrams via text-based commands. However, I can help you with the basic layout for the sequence in Plant UML format that you have to draw manually.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor curator
actor repository
actor staff_interface

curator -> repository: queue collection for replication
repository -> remote_storage_site: replicate collection
remote_storage_site --> repository: confirm replication
repository --> curator: confirm replication
curator -> staff_interface: display status
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram portrays the following sequence:
1. The curator queues a collection for replication.
2. The repository (or repository manager) initiates the replication at a remote storage site.
3. The remote storage site confirms the replication back to the repository.
4. The repository confirms the successful replication to the curator. 
5. The curator triggers the display status functionality in the staff interface to show the replication status in each item and component page in the staff interface.

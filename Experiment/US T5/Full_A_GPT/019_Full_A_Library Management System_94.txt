Here is the Plant UML format code for your described sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Librarian as L
participant "Member List Database" as M

L-> M: Request list of members
activate M
M-->> L: Return list of members
deactivate M
@enduml
```

Short Explanation:

The librarian initiates the list request (As a Librarian, I want to see the list of members). The Member List Database retrieves and returns the list of members to the librarian.

This sequence diagram is a simple overview of the interaction you described. Depending on the details and complexity of your use case, you might need to add more participants or steps. This might be the case if, for example, a certain server handles the request or if the librarian would have to authenticate first before accessing the list. If there's an user interface, it might also be included as a participant providing the list to the librarian.

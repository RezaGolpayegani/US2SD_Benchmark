To create a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the given user story, you will have to understand the interactions between different system components and their functional behaviors. Here is a generic example of how your PlantUML source code might look like:

```plantuml
@startuml
title DB/IR Administrator Views Subscriber List For Specified Report

actor DBAdmin
entity DBSystem
database ReportDB
entity NotifService
entity ReportRequester

DBAdmin -> DBSystem: View report subscribers
activate DBSystem

DBSystem -> ReportDB: Fetches subscribers list for specified report
activate ReportDB

ReportDB --> DBSystem: Returns subscribers list
deactivate ReportDB

DBSystem --> DBAdmin: Show subscribers list
deactivate DBSystem

DBAdmin -> NotifService: Request to check missing reports
activate NotifService

NotifService -> ReportRequester: Verify report complaints
activate ReportRequester

ReportRequester --> NotifService: Return results of report complaints
deactivate ReportRequester

NotifService --> DBAdmin: Show results of missing report complaints
deactivate NotifService

@enduml
```

In the above PlantUML code:

- "DBAdmin" is the database administrator who initializes the process.
- "DBSystem" represents the database system or management application.
- "ReportDB" symbolizes the specific database holding the report and its subscribers.
- "NotifService" might be a secondary system or service responsible for notification management.
- "ReportRequester" symbolizes the entity who requested the report.

Please note that in the context of John Sutter's requirements mentioned in the project description, elements such as "Symplectic Elements," "Activity Insight," and "files download notification" aren't represented in this user story, as details weren't provided on how exactly they interact in the given user story. Also, this is a simplified representation and you may add more lifelines and messages based on the complexity of the system.

Sure, below is an example of a sequence diagram in PlantUML for your project description and user story.

```
@startuml

title View Example Citation 

actor DataReuser
participant DatasetDatabase
participant DataDepositor

DataReuser -> DatasetDatabase: Request for Example Citation for Dataset
activate DatasetDatabase

DatasetDatabase -> DataDepositor: Request for Sample Citation
activate DataDepositor

DataDepositor --> DatasetDatabase: Provides Sample Citation
deactivate DataDepositor

DatasetDatabase --> DataReuser: Returns Sample Citation
deactivate DatasetDatabase

@enduml
```

This sequence diagram assumes that the Sample Citation for a dataset is held by the data depositor. When a data reuser requests an example citation for a dataset from the dataset database, it requests this information from the data depositor who then provides it. Then, this information is relayed back to the data reuser.

However, please note that this sequence diagram might vary based on the actual operations, data flow, and actors involved in your project. The diagram provided here is based on the limited context provided in the project description and user story.

Please note that as a text-based AI, I'm not able to generate a diagram. But I can provide you with the needed steps for creating a sequence diagram for this user story. 

For creating a sequence diagram in a plant UML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Member" as M
database "Library Database" as DB
participant "Book comments" as BC

M -> DB: Request all members' comments
activate DB
DB --> DB: Fetch all members' comments
activate BC
DB --> BC: Retrieve specific book comments
deactivate DB
BC --> M: Return comments
deactivate BC
@enduml
```

The above represents a sequence diagram in plant UML code format for a user who wants to see other members' comments on a specific book. 

This sequence starts with the user making a request for all the members' comments on a particular book. The system then retrieves all these comments and returns them to the member.

The participants in this sequence diagram are "Member", "Library Database", and "Book comments".

Please convert the above text to a diagram by using any UML drawing tools or compilers that support plant UML.

Remember, you may need to adjust the diagram to better fit your needs or system's reality.

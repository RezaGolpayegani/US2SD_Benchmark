Below is a detailed Sequence Diagram written in Plant UML format for the User Story: "As an OlderPerson, I want to use ALFRED for navigation"

```plantuml
@startuml
participant OlderPerson
participant "ALFRED Device" as ALFRED
participant "Navigation System" as nav

OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Command : "I want to go somewhere"
activate ALFRED
ALFRED -> ALFRED: Process spoken command
ALFRED --> OlderPerson: Confirmation: "Please clarify destination"
deactivate ALFRED

activate ALFRED
OlderPerson -> ALFRED: Specifies: "I want to go to [destination]"
ALFRED -> ALFRED: Process specification
deactivate ALFRED

activate ALFRED
ALFRED -> nav: Search: "[destination]"
activate nav
nav --> ALFRED: Returns: "Route to [destination]"
deactivate nav

ALFRED --> OlderPerson: "The route to [destination] is [steps]"
deactivate ALFRED

This sequence diagram begins with the Older Person initiating navigation request by saying "I want to go somewhere". ALFRED processes this command and asks the Older Person to clarify their destination. Once the destination is specified, the ALFRED processes the location and starts a search geolocation using the Navigation System. The Navigation System returns the route to the specified destination, which ALFRED relays back to the Older Person.

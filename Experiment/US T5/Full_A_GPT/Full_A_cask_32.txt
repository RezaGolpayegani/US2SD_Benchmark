Here is an example Plant UML sequence diagram based on the provided user story:

```
@startuml
AppDeveloper -> App: Deploy App

activate App

App -> Database: Deploy Dataset Type
Database --> App: Acknowledge

AppDeveloper -> App: Deploy Plugin

activate Plugin

App -> Plugin: Use Dataset Type

Plugin -> Database: Access Dataset Type

Database --> Plugin: Return Dataset 

deactivate Plugin

deactivate App
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows an app developer deploying an application that in turn deploys a dataset type. The dataset type is acknowledged by the database. The developer then deploys a plugin. The application provides the plugin with the dataset type, and the plugin accesses this from the database. The database then returns the dataset, and the plugin and application processes end.

This is a basic example and might not cover all what you asked for because the user story is quite vague and doesn't specify the actions of the plugin developer, how the custom dataset type is used in the plugin etc. Therefore, more specific user story descriptions would lead to a more detailed and helpful sequence diagram.

actor Waiter

boundary "Order System Interface" as OSI

entity "Order Management System" as OMS

database "Order Database" as OD

Waiter -> OSI : Enter order details

```

Explanation of sequence:
1. The Waiter enters order details into the Order System Interface (OSI).
2. OSI sends these order details to the Order Management System (OMS).
3. OMS saves the order details into the Order Database (OD).
4. OD confirms that the order data has been saved.
5. This confirmation is carried back to OMS, which relay the saving confirmation back to OSI.
6. OSI then displays a confirmation message to the Waiter to inform them that the order has been saved successfully.

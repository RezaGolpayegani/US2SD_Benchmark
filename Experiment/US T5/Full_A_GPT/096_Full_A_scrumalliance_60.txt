Below is the PlantUML Syntax for the sequence diagram relating to the user story:

```
@startuml

actor SiteVisitor as "Site Visitor"
participant Website as "Website"
participant NewsArticle as "News Article"

SiteVisitor -> Website : Visit Website
activate Website

Website -> NewsArticle : Get Articles
activate NewsArticle

NewsArticle --> Website : Return Articles
deactivate NewsArticle

Website --> SiteVisitor : Show Articles
deactivate Website

@enduml
```

**Explanation**

- "Site Visitor" is an actor who initiates the actions. 
- The actor interacts with "Website" first which subsequently interacts with "News Article" to retrieve the articles. 
- "News Article" returns back to the "Website" and then "Website" shows the articles back to the "Site Visitor".

Please note:

This is a simplistic sequence diagram. In a real-world system, there might be more complexities involved such as authentication, error handling, detailed processes which may involve more components and interactions. 

Please note that this diagram also assumes that articles are publicly available as per the user story provided and does not require any form of authentication.

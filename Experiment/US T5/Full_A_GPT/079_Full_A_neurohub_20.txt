I am an AI model and I don't have the ability to create diagrams or any pictorial representation of tasks or data. Anyway, I can describe how the sequence diagram should look like:

The sequence diagram would begin with the 'Supervisor' actor initiating a 'View' action. This action would be directed towards the 'System'. 

The System would then begin the 'VerifyUser' sequence where it checks if the user is indeed a supervisor. This involves communications back and forth between the System and Database, 'GetUserRole' from the Database, returning the 'Role' to the System.

On confirming the supervisor role, the system would proceed with the 'GetActivityLog' sequence. This involves 'RetrieveLog' action initiated by the system towards the log database which returns a 'LogData'.

The 'LogData' is then sent back to the 'Supervisor'. The 'Supervisor' could then initiate other sequences based on the viewed log like 'ViewFile', 'ViewFileDetails', etc.

In Plant UML format, you could represent these interactions with the following codes:

```
@startuml
Actor Supervisor

box "System" #LightBlue
  participant VerificationSystem
  participant Database
  participant LogSystem
end box

Supervisor -> VerificationSystem : View()
activate VerificationSystem
VerificationSystem -> Database : GetUserRole()
activate Database
Database --> VerificationSystem : Role
deactivate Database
VerificationSystem -> LogSystem : RetrieveLog()
activate LogSystem
LogSystem --> VerificationSystem : LogData
deactivate LogSystem
VerificationSystem --> Supervisor : LogData
deactivate VerificationSystem
@enduml
``` 

This is a very basic interpretation, you might need to tweak or add more relations based on the actual complexity of the system you are designing.

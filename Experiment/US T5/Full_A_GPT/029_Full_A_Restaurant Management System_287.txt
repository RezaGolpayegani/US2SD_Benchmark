Sure, Here's how it might look like:

```
@startuml
actor Waiter
participant "Order Management System" as OMS
participant Menu

Waiter -> OMS : request for menu
activate OMS
OMS -> Menu : fetch menu
activate Menu
Menu --> OMS : return menu
deactivate Menu
OMS --> Waiter : display menu
deactivate OMS
@enduml
```

This diagram includes a "Waiter" Actor who requests the menu from an "Order Management System," which then fetches it from the "Menu" Participant before returning it to the Waiter.

However, this may be adjusted depending on the specifics of the system.

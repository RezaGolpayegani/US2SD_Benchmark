Sequence diagrams work together with PlantUML, a tool that allows developers to create diagrams from a plain text language. Below is a sequence diagram for the user story, written in PlantUML code:

```plantuml
@startuml
title Define Schema of a Dataset Across All Dataset Types

"User" -> "Dataset Type Interface": Specify Schema(details)
activate "Dataset Type Interface"

"Dataset Type Interface" -> "App Developer": Validate Schema(details)
activate "App Developer"

"App Developer" -> "Data Type": Apply Schema(schema)
activate "Data Type"

"Data Type" --> "App Developer": Acknowledge Schema Applied
deactivate "Data Type"
"App Developer" --> "Dataset Type Interface": Return Validation Result
deactivate "App Developer"
"Dataset Type Interface" --> "User": Return Schema Specification Result
deactivate "Dataset Type Interface"

@enduml
```

In this diagram:

1. The User specifies the schema they want for their dataset, which is sent to the Dataset Type Interface.
2. The Dataset Type Interface validates this schema with the App Developer.
3. The App Developer then applies this schema to the Data Type.
4. The Data Type acknowledges that the schema has been applied and sends this information back up the chain to the User.

Remember, this is stored as a text file with a `.puml` extension and run with the `plantuml` command to generate an image of the sequence diagram.

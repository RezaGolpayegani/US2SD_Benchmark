Creating a sequence diagram requires understanding the system and its interactions, especially when it involves multiple steps or actors. Unfortunately, the project description provided does not allow me to generate a significant sequence diagram as it does not provide enough detail about how the system works.

However, I can provide an extremely simple sequence diagram based on the assumption that only one actor (librarian) and one system (library system) are involved in this user story.

```plantuml
@startuml
title List of Library Members Sequence Diagram
actor Librarian
participant LibrarySystem

Librarian -> LibrarySystem : request members list
activate LibrarySystem 
LibrarySystem --> Librarian: provide members list
deactivate LibrarySystem
@enduml
```
In this diagram, a librarian requests the list of members from the library system, which in turn provides the list back to the librarian. This is a very simplistic view, though. 

In a more complex system, there might be additional steps and interactions involved, such as the system querying a database, or the librarian specifying some filter or search criteria. These additional steps would need to be included in a detailed sequence diagram, but without more information, we can't provide those details here. 

Please provide more information about the steps involved when a librarian wants to see the list of members. This may include steps such as logging into the system, navigating to the appropriate screen or page, entering any search or filter criteria, and how the list of members is displayed or otherwise provided to the librarian.

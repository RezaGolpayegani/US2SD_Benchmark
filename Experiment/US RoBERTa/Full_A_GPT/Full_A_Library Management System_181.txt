The detailed sequence diagram will depict the interaction between the library member, the system interface, the library database, and the database result. Here's how it would look like in the PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml

actor "Library Member" as member
participant "System Interface" as interface
database "Library Database" as database
participant "Database Result" as result

== sorting and filtering book search results ==

member -> interface : Initiate search
activate interface
interface -> database : Execute query
activate database
database --> interface : Return raw results
deactivate database

interface -> interface : Apply sorting & filtering on raw results
interface --> member : Display sorted & filtered results
deactivate interface

@enduml
```

Here's the description of each step:

1. The "Library Member" initiates the search through the "System Interface".
2. The "System Interface" executes the query in the "Library Database".
3. The "Library Database" returns the raw results to the "System Interface".
4. The "System Interface" applies the sorting and filtering on the raw results.
5. The "System Interface" displays the sorted and filtered results to the "Library Member".

Please note that details could vary depending on how the sorting and filtering operations are actually performed within your system. If these operations are done in the database side, the diagram will show these processes as part of the database operations.

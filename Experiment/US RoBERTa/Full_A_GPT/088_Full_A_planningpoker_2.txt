Using PlantUML, a sequence diagram for this user story may look similar to this:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Moderator
participant "Estimator Portal" as EP
participant "Email Service" as ES
participant Estimator

Moderator -> EP: Enter_Estimators_Emails()
activate EP

EP -> ES: Send_Email_With_URL(Emails)
activate ES

ES --> EP: Confirm_Email_Sent()
deactivate ES

EP --> Moderator: Show_Confirmation()
deactivate EP

Moderator -> EP: Start_Game()
activate EP

EP --> Moderator: Game_Started()
deactivate EP

Estimator -> EP: Access_URL()
activate EP

EP --> Estimator: Show_Game_Interface()
deactivate EP
@enduml
```

In this sequence:

1. The moderator enters the emails of the estimators they want to invite to the estimator portal.
2. The Estimator Portal then interacts with the Email Service to send the emails with the URL for the game.
3. The Email Service sends a confirmation back to the Estimator Portal that the emails have been sent.
4. The Estimator Portal then displays a confirmation to the moderator that the emails have been sent.
5. The moderator then sends a command to start the game from the Estimator Portal.
6. The Estimator Portal sends a confirmation that the game has started back to the Moderator.
7. The estimator accesses the URL they received in their email and the Estimator Portal shows them the game interface.

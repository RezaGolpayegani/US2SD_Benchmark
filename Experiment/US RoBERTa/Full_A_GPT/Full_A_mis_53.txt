Creating a sequence diagram for this specific user story involves several systems interacting with each other, including the User (in this case, a data contributor), the System (such as a digital platform with a Disaster Recovery Plan), and a Grant Proposal system (where the data contributor submits the Grant Proposals & Data Management Plans).

Here's the PlantUML code for the sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
actor "Data Contributor" as DataContributor
entity "System" as System
database "Disaster Recovery Plan" as DisasterRecoveryPlan
entity "Grant Proposals & Data Management System" as GrantProposalsSystem

DataContributor --> System: Refer to Disaster Recovery Plan
activate System
System --> DisasterRecoveryPlan: Retrieve Disaster Recovery Plan
activate DisasterRecoveryPlan
DisasterRecoveryPlan --> System: Return Disaster Recovery Plan
deactivate DisasterRecoveryPlan
System --> DataContributor: Display Disaster Recovery Plan
deactivate System

DataContributor --> GrantProposalsSystem: Submit Grant Proposal \nwith reference to Disaster Recovery Plan
activate GrantProposalsSystem
GrantProposalsSystem --> GrantProposalsSystem: Assess Grant Proposal \nand Disaster Recovery Plan
deactivate GrantProposalsSystem
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram, the data contributor interacts with the system to request the Disaster Recovery Plan. The system retrieves the plan from its location (here, Disaster Recovery Plan) and returns it to the user. The user then submits a grant proposal, with the referenced Disaster Recovery Plan, to the Grant Proposals & Data Management System.

Please replace `"System"`, `"Disaster Recovery Plan"`, and `"Grant Proposals & Data Management System"` with the actual names and details of your systems. This diagram represents a simple flow and can be decorated with opt, alt, or loops depending on your use-case.

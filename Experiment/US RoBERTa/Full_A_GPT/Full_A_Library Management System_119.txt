Creating a sequence diagram for the user story involves several entities; the Library Manager, Book, System, and Database. Here's a basic sequence diagram description you could use for your Plant UML:

```
@startuml
participant "Library Manager" as A
entity "System" as B
database "Database" as C
entity "Book" as D

A -> B: Access the System to manage books
activate B
B -> C: Fetch list of all books
activate C
C --> B: Return list of all books
deactivate C
B --> A: Display list of all books
deactivate B

A -> B: Request to add new book
activate B
B -> C: Send Request to add new book
activate C
C --> B: Confirm that the book has been added
deactivate C
B --> A: Confirm new book has been added
deactivate B

A -> B: Access System to manage checkouts
activate B
B -> C: Fetch details of all checkouts
activate C
C --> B: Return details of all checkouts
deactivate C
B --> A: Display list of all checkouts
deactivate B

A -> B: Checkout a book to a user
activate B
B -> C: Send request to checkout book
activate C
C --> B: Confirm checkout
deactivate C
B --> A: Confirm checkout to Library Manager
deactivate B

A -> B: Return a book from a user
activate B
B -> C: Send request to return book
activate C
C --> B: Confirm return
deactivate C
B --> A: Confirm return to Library Manager
deactivate B

This PlantUML code represents the workflow of the library manager in relation to book management and book checkouts. The diagram starts with the library manager accessing the system to manage books, followed by the system fetching a list of books from the database. Then, the library manager initiates requests to add new books to the system.

Next, the library manager accesses the system to manage checkouts. The system fetches details of all checkouts from the database, and returns this list to the library manager.

Afterwards, the library manager can send a request to checkout a book to a user. Once checked out, there is also an option to return the book.

This is a high level view and needs to be adjusted according to acquisition-specific business rules and logic.

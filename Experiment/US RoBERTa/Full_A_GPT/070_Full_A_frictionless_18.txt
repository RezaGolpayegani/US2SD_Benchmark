Due to the limitations of the text-based platform, I will provide a general description of the structure of a PlantUML diagram for your user story. Alternatively, you might use an online PlantUML editor (https://www.planttext.com/) to view the diagram based on the provided script.

Here is the sequence diagram in PlantUML:

```
@startuml
Actor Developer
DataPackage -> Database: Request Data
activate Database
Database --> DataPackage: Send Data
deactivate Database
DataPackage -> Developer: Return Data
Developer -> Clojure: Load Data
activate Clojure
Developer <-- Clojure: Acknowledge Data Load
deactivate Clojure
Developer -> AnalysisTool: Start Analysis
activate AnalysisTool
Developer <-- AnalysisTool: Return Analysis Result
deactivate AnalysisTool
Developer -> VisualizationTool: Start Visualization
activate VisualizationTool
Developer <-- VisualizationTool: Return Visualization Result
deactivate VisualizationTool
@enduml
```

1. The `Developer` interacts with `DataPackage`, which in turn requests data from the `Database`.
2. Once the `Database` returns the data, `DataPackage` sends this data back to the `Developer`.
3. The `Developer` loads this data into `Clojure`.
4. After the data load is acknowledged by `Clojure`, the `Developer` starts the analysis by interfacing with an `AnalysisTool`.
5. The `AnalysisTool` returns the results of the analysis.
6. The `Developer` then starts the visualization using a `VisualizationTool`.
7. The `VisualizationTool` returns the result of the visualization.

Please note that this is a generalized interpretation of the user story based on the named tasks. You can always modify this to better suit your precise needs.

Creating a sequence diagram for this User Story will involve several entities including the Data Publishing User and the Platform Administrator.

Here's a simplified sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DataPublishingUser
actor PlatformAdministrator
database GeoJSON_sources

DataPublishingUser -> PlatformAdministrator: Request to Add GeoJSON Sources
activate PlatformAdministrator
PlatformAdministrator -> GeoJSON_sources: Verify GeoJSON source
activate GeoJSON_sources
GeoJSON_sources --> PlatformAdministrator: Verification Outcome
deactivate GeoJSON_sources

alt Verification Successful
    PlatformAdministrator --> DataPublishingUser: Add GeoJSON Sources Successfully
else Verification Failed
    PlatformAdministrator --> DataPublishingUser: Failed to Add GeoJSON Sources 
end
deactivate PlatformAdministrator
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram shows that a data publishing user starts the process by sending a request to add GeoJSON sources to the platform administrator. The platform administrator then verifies the GeoJSON source data. If the verification is successful, the user is notified that the GeoJSON sources have been added. If verification fails, the user is notified that the addition of the GeoJSON sources failed.

Of course, this is a very simplified sequence diagram. In real-world scenarios, more details would be included, such as specific data checking processes, database interactions, and extra steps required based on whether the initial verification is successful or not.

As an AI, I am unable to directly generate a sequence diagram within this text format, but I can provide you with the scripts that you can use in Plant UML to produce a sequence diagram for your User Story:

`
@startuml
title Adding Future Release Dates to Calendar

actor Administrator

database "DB/IR" as DB
entity "Calendar" as Calendar

Administrator -> DB : Retrieve Future Release Dates
activate DB
DB -->> Administrator : Future Release Dates
deactivate DB

Administrator -> Calendar : Add Dates to Calendar
activate Calendar
Calendar -->> Administrator : Confirmation of Dates Added
deactivate Calendar

@enduml
`

This sequence starts with the `Administrator` retrieving the `Future Release Dates` from the `DB/IR` and then adding these dates to the `Calendar`. `Calendar` finally sends a confirmation to the `Administrator`.

Copy the above script to Plant UML software or online tool to generate the sequence diagram.

The sequence diagram will assist in visualizing the process which helps developers to understand and implement the DB/IR administrator's user story: "As a DB/IR administrator, I want to add future release dates of reports/datasets to calendar for patron FYI."

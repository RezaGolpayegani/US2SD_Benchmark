Given the user story, the generated sequence diagram in PlantUML format would look like this:

```
@startuml
title Manager - View Customer Orders Reports

actor Manager
participant "Report System" as RS
participant "Order System" as OS
database "Customer Orders Database" as DB

Manager -> RS : Request for customer orders report
RS -> OS : Fetch customer orders data
OS -> DB : Retrieve all customer orders
DB --> OS : Returns all customer orders data
OS --> RS : Sends fetched data
RS --> Manager : Display customer orders report

@enduml
```
This sequence diagram illustrates the process of a manager (user) requesting to view reports on customer orders. The system had to interact with the Order System to get the data, which in turn retrieves the data from the Customer Orders database before returning it back to the Report System. Finally, the manager gets the orders report.

Please note that the specific details might differ depending on the actual architecture and functionalities of your system. This sequence diagram can be easily modified to suit your specific needs.

This sequence diagram begins with the `LibraryManager` who interacts with the `LibraryManagementSystem` by entering new book details. The system then validates these details and adds the new book record to the `BookDatabase`. Once the record is added successfully, the database confirms the creation of the book record to the system, which in turn displays a confirmation message to the `LibraryManager`.

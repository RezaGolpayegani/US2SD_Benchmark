Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I can't create a sequence diagram directly in Plant UML format. However, I can provide a textual layout of how you might structure it.

Step 1: Create a participant for Library Member, Library System, Book Sorting System and Library Database.

Step 2: Show interaction between "Library Member" and "Library System" â€“ this could be labeled something like "Request Book Sorting by Title."

Step 3: Then the "Library System" communicates with "Book Sorting System."

Step 4: "Book Sorting System" interact with "Library Database" to access book information.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Library Member" as A
participant "Library System" as B
participant "Book Sorting System" as C
participant "Library Database" as D

A -> B: Request Book Sorting by Title"
B -> C: User Request Sorting
C -> D: Access Books Info"
D --> C: Return Books Info
C --> B: Return Sorted Books
B --> A: Display Sorted Books
@enduml
```

In this sequence, please replace "Access Books Info", "Return Books Info", "Return Sorted Books", "Display Sorted Books"  with suitable methods that adhere to your actual project's methods and terminologies.

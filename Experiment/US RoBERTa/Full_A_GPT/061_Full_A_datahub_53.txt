As an AI language model, I'm currently unable to create diagrams directly. However, I can show you how you could structure your PlantUML to create a sequence diagram that fits your user story.

Here's what you might have in code:

```
@startuml

title View Publisher Profile Sequence

actor Consumer as c
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Profile Service" as PS
participant "Database" as DB
entity Publisher as p

c -> UI : Request to view Publisher Profile
UI -> PS : Calls fetchProfile(PublisherId)
activate PS
PS -> DB : fetchProfileData(PublisherId)
activate DB
DB -->> PS : Return ProfileData
deactivate DB
PS -->> UI : Returns Publisher Profile
deactivate PS
UI -->> c : Displays Publisher's Profile

```

Explained Steps:
1. The consumer (Customer) initiates a request to view the profile of a publisher.
2. The User Interface communicates this request to the Profile Service, passing the unique identifier of the Publisher.
3. Activation of the Profile Service - Handles the request by asking the database for the profile data associated with the given PublisherId.
4. Database is activated- It executes the fetch command and retrieves the required data.
5. The database returns said data to the Profile Service.
6. Deactivation of Profile service after receiving data from Database. 
7. The Profile Service then passes back the Publisher's profile to the User interface.
8. The User Interface finally displays the Publisher's profile to the Consumer.

You would replace "PublisherId" with whatever specific identifier you use in your system. The "-->>" symbols are used to denote a reply or response to a message previously sent.

To provide you with a sequence diagram, you must have knowledge about PlantUML syntax. Given the context of the description provided, it appears that the user wants to update a reservation for a book.

This sequence diagram illustrates the main interacting components involved when a member updates an online reservation for a book.

# first, you'll need to define participating objects

```
@startuml
actor Member as M
participant "Reservation System" as RS
participant "Database" as DB
```
# then you'll define the process

```
M -> RS : Update Reservation Request
activate RS
RS -> DB : Fetch Reservation 
activate DB
DB --> RS : Reservation Data
deactivate DB
RS -> RS : Update Reservation Data
RS -> DB : Update Reservation in DB
activate DB
DB --> RS : Update Confirmation
deactivate DB
RS --> M : Update Confirmation
deactivate RS
@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- `Member` sends an "Update Reservation Request" to the `Reservation System`.
- The `Reservation System` then sends a command to the `Database` to fetch the `Reservation Data`.
- `Database` sends back the `Reservation Data` to the `Reservation System`.
- The `Reservation System` updates the `Reservation Data` and sends an update command to the `Database`.
- `Database` sends an `Update Confirmation` back to the `Reservation System`.
- Finally, The `Reservation System` sends an `Update Confirmation` back to the `Member`.

You can visualize this PlantUML code with any PlantUML viewer or converter that supports sequence diagrams.

Please note that this is a simple sequence diagram, and the actual interaction may be more complicated and involve more participants depending on your system design and the exact requirements of the online reservation update process.

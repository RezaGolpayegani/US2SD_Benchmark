Here is the sequence diagram in Plant UML syntax :

```puml

@startuml
participant "Authenticated User" as A
participant "Registration System" as B
participant "Database" as C

A -> B: Request to register for training
activate B
B -> C: Check limit of registration for user
activate C
C --> B: Registration info ( number of registrations in the present day )
deactivate C
alt no previous registration
    B --> A : Registration form 
    A --> B : Fill and submit registration form 
    B -> C : Save registration details
    activate C
    C --> B : Confirmation of saving data
    deactivate C
    B --> A : Confirmation of successful registration 
else Previous Registration found
    B --> A : Error: Already registered for the day
end
deactivate B
@enduml

```

This sequence diagram implies the following flow:

- The Authenticated User sends a request to register for training to the registration system.
- The Registration system checks in the database for any other registrations made by this user on the current date.
- If no other registrations are found, the system provides a registration form to the user.
- After filling and submitting the form, the system saves this new registration in the database.
- If the database confirms the successful saving of data, the system informs the user about the successful registration.
- In case the system finds a registration from the user on the current date, it informs the user that they have already registered for the day.

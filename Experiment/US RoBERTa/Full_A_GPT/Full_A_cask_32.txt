Unfortunately, generating the exact Plant UML sequence diagram is not possible in this text-based format. Still, Here's a simple high-level procedure, which does not include every individual method and action but provides an overall procedure:

Here's a high-level sequence diagram procedure that reflects this user story.

```
@startuml

participant "Plugin Developer" as P
participant "Custom Dataset Type" as C
participant "Plugin" as Pl
participant "App" as A

P -> C : Create/Deploy Custom Dataset Type
activate C
P <- C : Confirm Creation/Deployment 

P -> Pl : Embed Custom Dataset Type
activate Pl
P <- Pl : Confirm Embedding

Pl -> A : Deploy App with Custom Dataset

P -> Pl : Use Custom Dataset Type 
Pl --> A : Request Data Access
A --> Pl : Provide Data Access
P <-- Pl : Receive Data

@enduml
```

Here, we are assuming that the custom dataset type has been established separately and is being used in the context of a plugin that is part of an app. 

This sequence highlights all the unique parts in the procedure, including the creation and deployment of the custom dataset type, its embedding in the plugin, the deployment of the app with the plugin, and the eventual use of the custom dataset in the app. 

Though this might not fill in the details, it would at least give a comprehensive sense of the development procedure called for in this user story.

Please substitute this into an appropriate PlantUML editor to generate the sequence diagram.

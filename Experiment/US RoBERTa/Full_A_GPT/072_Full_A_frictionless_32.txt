Unfortunately, creating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format through text is quite challenging and practically impossible to visualize. However, I can provide a general model for creating one, based on your user story. I'd recommend writing these lines in a PlantUML editor:

'''
@startuml
actor Developer
box "Data-packaged Data System"
participant "Client Interface"
participant "API Gateway"
participant "Integration Service"
end box
box "DSpace System"
participant DSpace
end box

Developer -> "Client Interface": Request integration
"Client Interface" -> "API Gateway": Forward request
"API Gateway" -> "Integration Service": Request integration
"Integration Service" -> DSpace: Fetch data-packaged data
DSpace -->> "Integration Service": Return packaged data
"Integration Service" -->> "API Gateway": Return processed integration
"API Gateway" -->> "Client Interface": Forward integration Response
"Client Interface" -->> Developer: Return integration Response
@enduml
'''

This diagram describes a basic sequence of steps for integrating data-packaged data with pipelines that use DSpace. Note that this is a simplified design and you may need to add more elements or steps based on your specific needs and system architecture.

You just copy these lines into a PlantUML editor, and it will generate a sequence diagram. You might need to install some extensions or use online editors for this process.

Since this platform does not support diagrams. Here is the text which you can use to generate the diagram on a PlantUML tool:

```
@startuml
actor DatasetDeveloper
boundary DatasetType
entity DatasetInstance

DatasetDeveloper -> DatasetType : Deploy()
activate DatasetType

DatasetType -> DatasetInstance : Create()
activate DatasetInstance

DatasetInstance -> DatasetType : Initialize self deployment()
deactivate DatasetType

DatasetInstance -> DatasetDeveloper : Allow exploration()
deactivate DatasetInstance
@enduml
```

Explanation:
1. "DatasetDeveloper" (the user) initiates the process. This is shown by the arrow starting at "DatasetDeveloper". They are executing the function "Deploy()" on the "DatasetType".

2. "DatasetType" then creates a "DatasetInstance". 

3. The DatasetInstance initializes a self-deployment, represented by the "Initialize self deployment()". 

4. Once the DatasetInstance is ready, it allows the DatasetDeveloper to start exploring the newly created DatasetInstance through the function "Allow exploration()". 

The "activate" and "deactivate" keywords are used to show when an actor is active in a process. I have assumed certain function names (Deploy(), Create(), Initialize self deployment() and Allow exploration()) based on the given project description. Please replace them as appropriate for your actual system.

As an AI model, I can't draw diagrams. But I can describe how to arrange the steps for generating a sequence diagram in Plant UML format for the provided user story.

1. Define the system boundary, let's call it `RestaurantSystem`.
2. Define the first actor as 'Waiter'.
3. Waiter sends a message `viewOrders` to `RestaurantSystem`.
4. Then `RestaurantSystem` calls its internal methods `fetchOrders` to retrieve all orders.
5. `RestaurantSystem` then sends `showOrders` message back to 'Waiter'.

Now in plain text for PlantUML, you would have something like:

```plantuml
actor Waiter
boundary RestaurantSystem

Waiter -> RestaurantSystem: viewOrders()
activate RestaurantSystem

RestaurantSystem -> RestaurantSystem: fetchOrders()
activate RestaurantSystem
deactivate RestaurantSystem

RestaurantSystem -> Waiter: showOrders(orders)
deactivate RestaurantSystem
``` 

Please, enter the code above into your PlantUML environment to get the diagram as explained.

This is a textual representation of the Sequence Diagram in Plant UML format:

```
@startuml

title Grant Embargo Privileges

actor DigitalRecordsArchivist as dra
participant Repository as repo
participant "Other Repository Admin" as ora

note right of dra: As a DigitalRecords Archivist,
note right of dra: I want to grant embargo privileges
note right of dra: to other repository administrators.

dra -> repo: Access Repository
activate repo
repo --> dra: Access Granted

dra -> repo: Grant Embargo Privileges
activate repo
repo -> ora: Grant Embargo Privileges
deactivate repo
activate ora
ora --> dra: Permission Granted
deactivate ora

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the process of granting embargo privileges by the DigitalRecords Archivist to the Other Repository Admin. The archivist first accesses the repository, then goes on to grant the privileges, which are then confirmed by the other admin. You can paste this text into any PlantUML rendering tool (like the one found on plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/) to visualise this sequence diagram. 

Please note it is made with basic knowledge about your project, it can be more specific and complex based on additional details. Also, this sequence might be recurring based on the system's design or based on specific privileges within the system that's been designed or implemented.

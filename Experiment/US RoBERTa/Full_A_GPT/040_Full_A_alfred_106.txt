Please note the following sequence and interactions:

1. The OlderPerson (user) sends a request to the HealthTipsSystem for health tips. 

2. The HealthTipsSystem then makes a request to the HealthDatabase to retrieve the relevant health tips data.

3. The HealthDatabase returns the requested data to the HealthTipsSystem.

4. Finally, the HealthTipsSystem returns the health tips to the OlderPerson. 

This diagram indicates that the process is initiated by the OlderPerson's request and the HealthTipsSystem retrieves the necessary data from the HealthDatabase and displays it back to the OlderPerson.

Sequence Diagram in PlantUML:

```
@startuml
actor Librarian
entity "Book Database" as db
database "Notification System" as ns

Librarian -> db : Request expired books
activate db
db --> Librarian : Return list of expired books
deactivate db

Librarian -> ns : Send notification for expired books
activate ns
ns --> Librarian : Confirmation of notification sent
deactivate ns

@enduml
```

This diagram describes the interaction between the librarian, the book database, and the notification system. The librarian requests a list of expired books from the book database, which then returns this list. The librarian then sends a notification for the expired books using the notification system, which confirms that the notification has been sent. Please note, this sequence diagram assumes the existence of a pre-built notification system where the librarian can directly send notifications. BufferedReader and BufferedWriter need to be handle in terms of programming in Java or any other language used.

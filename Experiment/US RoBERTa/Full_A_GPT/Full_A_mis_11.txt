Given the complexity of creating diagrams through text, it's impossible to directly create a sequence diagram. However, I can provide you with a PlantUML code based on your user story. Please interpret this as a transcription only and you may need to adjust it to suit the specific needs of your project.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Collection replication sequence diagram

actor Curator
participant "Collection Repository" as CR
participant "Storage Site" as SS
participant "Staff Interface" as SI

Curator -> CR : Ingest Collection
CR -> SS : Queue Collection for Replication
SS -> CR : Return Replication Status
CR -> SI : Display Replication Status
Curator -> SI : View Replication Status

@enduml
```

In the above sequence diagram, the following steps are represented.
1. The Curator ingests the Collection to the Collection Repository.
2. The Collection Repository sends a request to the Storage Site to queue the Collection for Replication.
3. The Storage Site replicates the collection and sends the replication's status back to the Collection Repository.
4. The Collection Repository updates the Staff Interface with the current replication status.
5. The Curator views the Replication Status on the Staff Interface.

You can paste the provided code into any PlantUML editor to see a visualization of the sequence diagram. Please note that you might need to adapt this to your specific project requirements.

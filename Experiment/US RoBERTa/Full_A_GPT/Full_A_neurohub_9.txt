Below is a sample sequence diagram in PlantUML format. 

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher
participant "Experiment System" as ES

Researcher --> ES: Request to create a log book page
activate ES
ES --> Researcher: Provide template for new page
Researcher -> ES: Fill in details and submits
ES -> ES: Save the page details to database
ES --> Researcher: Confirmation of page creation

Researcher -> ES: Request to attach a file to page
activate ES
ES --> Researcher: Provide interface to upload file
Researcher -> ES: Select and upload file
ES -> ES: Attach file to the page
ES --> Researcher: Confirmation of attachment
@enduml
```
In the above sequence diagram, 

1. The researcher requests the experiment system to create a new log book page.
2. The system provides the researcher with a template for the new page.
3. The researcher fills in the details of the page and submits it back to the system.
4. The system saves the page details in its database and confirms the same to the researcher.
5. The researcher requests the system to attach a file to this page.
6. The system presents an interface for the researcher to upload the file. 
7. Researcher selects and uploads the file, then the system attaches it to the page. 
8. Finally, the system confirms the attachment to the researcher.

Please note that in a real implementation, error handling steps would be added to manage all the possible errors / exceptions that could occur in each of the steps of the process.

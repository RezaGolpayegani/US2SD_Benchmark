Your request is quite complex that I cannot generate a Plant UML sequence diagram here because text and drawings are not supported in this platform. But I can guide you on how you can do it.

This is a description of a sequence diagram with al possible actions that can be done by a manager to edit employees' shifts.

1. Manager is authenticated and logs into the system (UI).
2. The system verifies the manager's identity.
3. The UI sends a message (getData) to the database to retrieve the list of employees and display them.
4. The manager selects an employee whose shift he wants to edit and sends a request (getShift) to the system.
5. The system fetches this employee's shift details from the database.
6. The system sends this data to the UI.
7. The manager makes the necessary changes and sends an editShift request to the UI.
8. The UI sends the editShift request to the database with the updated data.
9. The database updates the shift info and sends an acknowledgment back to the UI.
10. The UI acknowledges that the shift details have been updated successfully to the manager.

In PlantUML the code would look like (Without notes and options):

```
@startuml

actor Manager
entity "UI" as UI
database "DB" as DB

Manager -> UI : Logs In
UI -> DB : getData()
DB -> UI : return employee data
UI -> Manager : Display employees
Manager -> UI : getShift(employeeId)
UI -> DB : getShift(employeeId)
DB -> UI: return shift data
UI -> Manager : Display shift details

Manager -> UI : editShift(employeeId, newShiftData)
UI -> DB : editShift(employeeId, newShiftData)
DB -> UI : Shift updated
UI --> Manager : Acknowledges shifts updation

Here, you can copy this code and paste it into any PlantUML editor to see the sequence diagram.

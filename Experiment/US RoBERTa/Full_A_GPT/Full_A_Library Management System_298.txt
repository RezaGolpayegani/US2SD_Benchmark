This is a basic example of a Plant UML sequence diagram that reflects the given user story. 

User Stories don't commonly include enough details to fully create a sequence diagram, but this will serve as a guideline.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Member" as M
participant "LibrarySystem" as LS
participant "Database" as DB

M -> LS: Request book details
activate LS
LS -> DB: Fetch book details
activate DB
DB -->> LS: Return book details
deactivate DB
LS -->> M: Display book details including due date(if book is borrowed)
deactivate LS
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows that:

1. The member requests the details of a book from the library system.
2. The Library System sends a request to the Database to fetch the book details.
3. The Database returns the book details to the Library System.
4. The Library System display the book details including due date to the member, but only if the book has already been borrowed.

Please note that more sophisticated library systems can have more interactive or complicated flows, including different ways to handle errors or exceptional cases, more detailed steps to authenticate the member, etc. This is just a simple baseline for how the given user story could be interpreted.

Given the user story, here is a simple representation of a Sequence Diagram for this scenario written in PlantUML language:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor DB_IR_Administrator as admin
database SubscriberDatabase as DBase
entity Report as rep

admin -> DBase: Request subscribers for specific report
alt Missing report complaint
DBase --> admin: Return list of subscribers
admin -> admin: Research subscribers' details
else No complaint
admin --> admin: No action required
end
admin --> rep: Query related report
rep --> admin: Returns report data
admin -> admin: Research report data
@enduml
```
Let's break down this sequence:

1. The DB/IR Administrator ("admin") sends a request to the Subscriber Database ("DBase") asking for the list of subscribers to a particular report.

2. In the case there's a missing report complaint, the database returns to the admin the list of subscribers. The admin then researches these subscribers' details.

3. If there's no complaint, the admin doesn't need to take any action.

4. Regardless of whether there was a complaint, the admin queries the related report ("rep"), which returns its data for the admin to research.

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between a DB/IR Administrator, a Subscriber Database, and a Report entity in the given user story. Please note that you can further refine this sequence diagram depending on the specifics of the scenario and the system involved.

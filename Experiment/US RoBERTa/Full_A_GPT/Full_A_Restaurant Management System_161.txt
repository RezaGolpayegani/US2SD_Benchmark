As a language AI model, I cannot provide diagrams but can describe the sequence diagram that needs to be created in Plant UML format. You need to visualize this accordingly:

Your diagram will showcase the flow of actions and interactions through a sequence of steps. It should include the manager (as actor), the sales system (as control), and the sales database (as entity).

PlantUML code could look something like this:

```plantuml 
@startuml

actor Manager

boundary "Sales System" as Sales 
database "Sales Database" as Database

Manager -> Sales: Request Total Sales and Profit
activate Sales

Sales -> Database: Query Total Sales
activate Database
Database -->> Sales: Return Total Sales
deactivate Database

Sales -> Database: Query Total Profit
activate Database
Database -->> Sales: Return Total Profit
deactivate Database

Sales -->> Manager: Return Total Sales and Profit Information
deactivate Sales

@enduml
```

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with the manager initiating a request for total sales and profit to the Sales System. The sales system then communicates with the Sales Database to query and retrieve the total sales, followed by total profit. The sales and profit information is then returned from the Sales Database to the Sales System, which finally communicates this information back to the Manager. 

Each interaction is represented by an arrow, with the message/interaction name labeled above it. Solid-line arrows with solid-line arrowheads represent synchronous calls, while dashed-line arrows with open-arrowheads represent return messages.

Please convert this code to a diagram on the PlantUML online server or in the development environment you're using.

Here is a possible sequence diagram:

```
@startuml
participant "Staff Member" as S
database "Library Database" as LD
participant "Analytics Service" as AS

S -> AS: Request usage statistics
activate AS
AS -> LD: Retrieve repository stats
activate LD
LD --> AS: Return repository stats
deactivate LD
AS -> LD: Retrieve collection stats
activate LD
LD --> AS: Return collection stats
deactivate LD
AS -> LD: Retrieve author stats
activate LD
LD --> AS: Return author stats
deactivate LD
AS -> LD: Retrieve item stats
activate LD
LD --> AS: Return item stats
deactivate LD
AS --> S: Display requested statistics
deactivate AS
@enduml
```
This sequence diagram signifies that initially, the staff member requests for usage statistics from an analytics service. This analytics service then fetches the required data (repository, collection, author, item stats) sequentially from the library database. On successfully fetching all the data from the database, the analytics service then displays the required information back to the staff member.

Please note this is a simplified representation and does not cover all potential error handling.

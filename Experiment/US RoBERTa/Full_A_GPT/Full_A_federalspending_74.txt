As the details about how the system or app works or how the user interacts with it are not provided, the below sequence diagram focuses on a conceptual interaction only. Here, we assume that the system may include several components, like User Interface, File Handling Module, and a File Format Verification Module.

Please note that in a real-life project, the diagram would be far more specific and complex and directly related to how the system has been designed.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor AgencyUser
boundary UserInterface
control FileHandlingModule
entity FileFormatVerificationModule

AgencyUser -> UserInterface : Selects File F
UserInterface -> FileHandlingModule : Sends File F
FileHandlingModule -> FileFormatVerificationModule : Verify Format of File F
FileFormatVerificationModule -->> FileHandlingModule : File Format Verification Status

alt Format Correct
    FileHandlingModule -> UserInterface : Sends File F
    UserInterface -->> AgencyUser : Provides File F
else Format Incorrect
    FileHandlingModule -> UserInterface : Sends Error Message (Incorrect Format)
    UserInterface -->> AgencyUser : Shows Error Message (Incorrect Format)
end

@enduml
```

In this sequence diagram:

- The Agency User selects File F through the User Interface.
- The User Interface then sends File F to the File Handling Module.
- The File Handling Module sends File F to the File Format Verification Module for format verification.
- If the format is correct, File F is sent back to the User Interface, which provides it to the Agency User.
- If the format is incorrect, an error message is sent to the User Interface, which shows it to the Agency User.

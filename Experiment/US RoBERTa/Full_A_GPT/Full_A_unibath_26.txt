Steps Explanation: 
1. The user, identified as 'DataReuser', interacts with the system to request for a dataset's information which will be used later to request the citation example.
2. The system, identified as 'Dataset', serves this information to the user. The Dataset is deactivated after sending the requested information.
3. With the dataset information received, the 'DataReuser' makes a request to the 'CitationDatabase' to provide a citation example.
4. The 'CitationDatabase' provides the citation example to the 'DataReuser'. The CitationDatabase is deactivated after sending the citation example back to the user.

Please note that this sequence diagram is a generalized explanation of the interaction rather than a specific implementation. The actual sequence may depend on the real-world factors like the presence of authentication, the exact technology in use, etc.

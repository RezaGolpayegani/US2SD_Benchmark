Since I'm an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to create graphics directly. However, I can generate the PlantUML textual code that represents the sequence diagram for the given user story. Below is the UML representation:

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Anonymous User" as A
participant "Web Server" as B
participant "Application Server" as C
participant "Database" as D

A -> B: Request to access the list of summits
B -> C: Forwards the request to the Application Server
C -> D: Queries for summmits data
D --> C: Returns the summits data
C --> B: Sends the summits data 
B --> A: Displays the list of summits

@enduml
```

This UML code represents the sequence of actions which happens when an anonymous user requests to see a list of all the summits. The user makes a request to the web server, which then forwards the request to the application server. The application server queries the database for the summits data and returns the data back to the application server. The application server then sends this data to the web server, which finally displays the list of the summits to the user.

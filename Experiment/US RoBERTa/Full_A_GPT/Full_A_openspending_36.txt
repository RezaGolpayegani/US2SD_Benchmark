According to the description, a user story is given where the user is an API User who wants to normalise data measures by GDP.

This breakdown will focus on presenting the user's interaction with the API system in coordinating the normalization process.

A sequence diagram is a great way to visualize this process and understand the flow of operations. Here is a sample Plant UML format:

```plantuml
title Normalize Measures by GDP

actor API_User as u
boundary API_System as s
database Data_Server as d

u -> s: Request(normalizeDataByGDP)
activate s
s -> d: getDatasets()
activate d
d -- s: return datasets
deactivate d
s -> s: Normalize(datasets)
s -- u: response(normalizedData)
deactivate s
```

This sequence diagram works as follows:

- An API user sends a normalization request to the API system.

- The API system sends a get request to the data server to gather all the available datasets.

- The data server returns the datasets to the API system.

- The API system starts the normalization process on the retrieved datasets.

- Once the process is finished, the API system sends back the normalized data to the API user as a response. 

Please note that this diagram represents a simplified version of the process and can be extended by adding more system's features, possible errors and exception handling steps.

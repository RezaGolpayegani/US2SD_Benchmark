Here is the sequence of this diagram:
1. The owner enters the email of the person they want to invite.
2. The server validates the email format.
3. If the email is valid, the server checks if the email is already registered in the database.
4. If the email is not registered, the server registers the email into the database and confirms the registration.
5. The server sends a confirmation to the owner.
6. The server sends an email to the Invitee.
7. The invitee clicks on the invitation link.
8. The server verifies the invitation link and displays the registration page to the Invitee.
9. The Invitee signs up and becomes a member of the Publisher.

If the email is already registered, an error message is shown to the owner. Similarly, if the email is not valid, an error message is sparked to the owner.

To illustrate the detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a library manager, I want to keep books and their checkouts," using PlantUML, we'll define a series of interactions between the Library Manager and the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), including its components such as the User Interface (UI), Book Management System, and Database.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme amiga

participant LibraryManager as LM
participant "UI: Book Management Module" as UI
participant "Backend: Book Management System" as Backend
database "CLMS Database" as DB

== Book Checkouts Management ==

LM -> UI: Accesses Book Management
UI -> Backend: Authenticate Manager

Backend -> DB: Validate Manager Credentials
activate DB
DB --> Backend: Credentials Validated

Backend --> UI: Access Granted

LM -> UI: Request Checkout Records

UI -> Backend: Fetch Checkout Records
activate Backend

Backend -> DB: Query Checkout Records
activate DB

DB --> Backend: Return Checkout Records
deactivate DB

Backend --> UI: Display Checkout Records

== Book Returns Management ==

LM -> UI: Update Book Return
UI -> Backend: Process Return Update
activate Backend

Backend -> DB: Update Return Status
activate DB

DB --> Backend: Return Status Updated
deactivate DB

Backend --> UI: Confirm Return Update
deactivate Backend

UI --> LM: Return Update Confirmed

**Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:**

1. **Library Manager (LM) Accesses Book Management:** The library manager starts the process by accessing the book management module through the user interface.

2. **Authentication:** The backend system authenticates the manager's credentials with the database to ensure that access is authorized.

3. **Fetching and Displaying Checkout Records:**
   - The library manager requests to view checkout records.
   - The book management module communicates with the backend to fetch these records from the database.
   - The checkout records are then displayed to the library manager through the user interface.

4. **Updating Book Returns:**
   - The library manager updates a book return, signaling a change in the checkout status.
   - The backend processes this update and modifies the return status in the database.
   - Confirmation of the return update is sent back to the library manager through the user interface.

This diagram represents a simplified overview of the sequence of interactions involved in managing book checkouts and returns from the perspective of a library manager using the Comprehensive Library Management System.

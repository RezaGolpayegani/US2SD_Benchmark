To create a detailed Sequence Diagram for the user story "As a member, I want to see the due date" using Plant UML, it's important to outline the interactions between various system components that would be involved in such a feature. Let's break down the steps you might need and then articulate them in Plant UML format.

1. **Member initiates a request** to view the due date for a borrowed book.
2. **System verifies the member's identity** and authorization to access due dates.
3. **System retrieves the member's borrowed books** from the database.
4. **System displays the due dates** for the member's borrowed books.

Now, let's translate these interactions into a Plant UML sequence diagram format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member as M
participant "Identity Verification\nSystem" as IVS
database "Library Database" as LD
participant "Due Date\nDisplay System" as DDS

== View Due Date ==
M -> IVS: Request to view due dates
activate IVS
IVS -> LD: Verify member identity and access rights
activate LD
LD --> IVS: Identity and access rights verified
deactivate LD
IVS --> M: Access Granted
deactivate IVS
M -> LD: Request borrowed books data
activate LD
LD -> LD: Retrieve borrowed books and due dates
LD --> M: Display borrowed books and due dates
deactivate LD
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram starts with the Member (M) making a request to view due dates, which goes through an Identity Verification System (IVS) to ensure that the member has the rights to view this information. Once verified, the member makes another request to retrieve borrowed books data from the Library Database (LD), which then retrieves and displays the due dates for the member's borrowed books.

Note: This sequence diagram is simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, additional steps for error handling, security checks, and more detailed interactions with the database might be necessary.

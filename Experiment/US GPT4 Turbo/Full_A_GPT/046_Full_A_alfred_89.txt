Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As an Older Person, I want to have the ALFRED shirt to be non-stigmatizing" involves illustrating the interactions between the Older Person, the ALFRED System (including its components, like the user interface), and potentially the Product Design Team who would work on the non-stigmatizing aspects of the wearable technology. I'll outline a basic process for this using PlantUML syntax.

Please note that the sequence diagram will be conceptual due to the abstract nature of the user story which focuses more on product features and design philosophy rather than a specific sequence of functional operations like a login process or data retrieval.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor OlderPerson as OP
participant "ALFRED UI" as UI
participant "Customization Settings" as CS
participant "Product Design Team" as PDT

OP -> UI: Access Wearable Customization
UI -> CS: Display Customization Options
CS -> UI: List Non-Stigmatizing Features (e.g., colors, designs)
UI -> OP: Choose Features

OP -> UI: Provide Feedback
UI -> CS: Collect User Feedback
CS -> PDT: Analyze Feedback for Design Improvements
PDT -> CS: Implement Design Changes
CS -> UI: Update Customization Options
UI -> OP: Inform about New Features

This sequence diagram starts with the Older Person accessing customization options for the wearable through the ALFRED User Interface (UI). The system displays various non-stigmatizing features such as color and design choices. After the Older Person makes their selections, thereâ€™s also a path for feedback where they can provide comments or suggestions on the wearable's design. This feedback is analyzed by the Product Design Team for potential design improvements, which are then implemented, and the customization options are updated accordingly. 

The interactions are kept high-level, reflecting the design and preference-driven nature of the user story rather than specific technical operations like data transactions or algorithmic processing. This approach focuses on the user experience, highlighting the importance of offering non-stigmatizing options and respecting user feedback in the design cycle.

The specific request for a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the user story is a tailored and technical task which might require iterating over certain technical specifics. However, I'm going to provide a high-level approximation of what a PlantUML sequence diagram could look like for the given user story. This approximation outlines how the collection curator interacts with the system, and how the system in turn triggers replication processes and updates statuses.

Please note, to turn this into a working PlantUML diagram, you would need the PlantUML software or an online tool that can interpret and render PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Collection Curator" as curator
participant "Repository System" as system
participant "Replication Service" as replication
database "Remote Storage" as storage
participant "Staff Interface" as interface

== Ingest Collection for Replication ==
curator -> system : Ingest new collection
activate system
system -> replication : Queue for replication
activate replication

== Replication Process ==
replication -> storage : Replicate collection
activate storage
storage --> replication : Replication complete
deactivate storage

replication -> system : Update replication status
deactivate replication

== Update and Display Status ==
system -> interface : Update item/component status
activate interface
curator -> interface : View replication status
interface --> curator : Display status
deactivate interface

```

Key Steps in the Diagram:

1. **Ingest Collection for Replication**: The collection curator ingests a new collection into the repository system.
2. **Queue for Replication**: The repository system queues the new collection for replication to the remote storage.
3. **Replication Process**: The replication service starts replicating the collection to remote storage, and upon completion, it updates the repository system with the replication status.
4. **Update and Display Status**: The repository system updates the replication status in the staff interface, where the collection curator can then view the updated status of each item and component.

This diagram is intentionally simplified to showcase the general sequence of interactions tied to the user story. Depending on the complexity of the actual system being designed (including error handling, authentication, etc.), more detailed sequences and additional components may need to be represented.

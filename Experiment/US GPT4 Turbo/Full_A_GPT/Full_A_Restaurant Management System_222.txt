To create a detailed sequence diagram for the User Story: "As a manager, I want to view reports on customer orders so that I can pinpoint recurring orders" using PlantUML, follow the below diagram description. This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the manager, and the Restaurant Management and Operations System, including subsystems like the Reporting Module, Database, and Analytics Engine.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager as manager
participant "UI Interface" as UI
participant "Reporting Module" as Reporting
database "Database" as DB
participant "Analytics Engine" as Analytics

manager -> UI: Access Report Section
UI -> Reporting: Request Customer Orders Report
Reporting -> DB: Query Order Details
DB -> Reporting: Return Order Details
Reporting -> Analytics: Analyze Recurring Orders
Analytics -> Reporting: Return Recurring Orders Analysis
Reporting -> UI: Display Report with Recurring Orders
UI -> manager: Show Recurring Orders Report

### Explanation:

1. **Manager to UI Interface**: The process starts with the manager accessing the reporting section of the system's user interface (UI).

2. **UI Interface to Reporting Module**: The UI then requests the Reporting Module to generate a report on customer orders.

3. **Reporting Module to Database**: The Reporting Module queries the Database to retrieve detailed records of all customer orders.

4. **Database to Reporting Module**: The Database returns the requested order details back to the Reporting Module.

5. **Reporting Module to Analytics Engine**: These details are then passed to the Analytics Engine, where an analysis is conducted to pinpoint recurring orders based on defined criteria (e.g., frequency of orders, popular items, etc.).

6. **Analytics Engine to Reporting Module**: The result of the analysis, highlighting the recurring orders, is sent back to the Reporting Module.

7. **Reporting Module to UI Interface**: The Reporting Module compiles the findings into a comprehensive report and sends it to the UI.

8. **UI Interface to Manager**: Finally, the UI displays the report with the analysis of recurring orders to the manager. This allows the manager to gain insights into customer preferences and potentially adapt the restaurant's menu or inventory accordingly.

This PlantUML sequence diagram thus visually represents the flow of actions triggered by a manager's request to view reports on customer orders, specifically focusing on identifying recurring orders using the Restaurant Management and Operations System.

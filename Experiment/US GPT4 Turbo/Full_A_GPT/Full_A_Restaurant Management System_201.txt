To fulfill the request for generating a detailed Sequence Diagram in PlantUML format for the User Story “As a manager, I want to see the remaining items”, let's first outline what this process may look like before diving into the code snippet for the PlantUML diagram.

### Process Overview:
1. The manager decides to check the remaining items in inventory.
2. The manager logs into the Restaurant Management and Operations System.
3. The manager navigates to the inventory management section.
4. The manager sends a request to view remaining items.
5. The system queries the database for current inventory levels.
6. The database returns the inventory levels.
7. The system processes the data and displays it to the manager.

### PlantUML Code:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Manager
participant "Management Interface" as Interface
participant "System Backend" as Backend
database "Database" as DB

Manager -> Interface: Login
Manager -> Interface: Navigate to Inventory Management
Manager -> Interface: Request to view remaining items
Interface -> Backend: Fetch remaining items
Backend -> DB: Query inventory levels
DB -> Backend: Return inventory data
Backend -> Interface: Process and display data
Interface -> Manager: Show remaining items

```

### Explanation:
- **Actor (Manager)**: Initiates the process by deciding to view the remaining items in the inventory.
- **Management Interface**: The UI through which the manager interacts with the system. It receives the manager's requests and displays the information returned by the backend.
- **System Backend**: This component handles the logic of the system, including processing requests from the interface, interacting with the database, and performing any needed calculations or data formatting.
- **Database**: Where all the data is stored, including inventory levels. It's queried by the System Backend to retrieve the current inventory levels.

This sequence diagram aims to provide a clear, simplified view of the interactions between the manager and the system components when attempting to view the remaining inventory items. It illustrates the flow of information and the sequence in which these interactions occur, following the manager's initial request up to receiving the data.

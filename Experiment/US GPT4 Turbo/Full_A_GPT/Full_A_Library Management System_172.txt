Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story "As a library member, I want to reserve more than one book" involves several actors and components interacting within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). Here's a Plant UML sequence diagram that outlines these interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
entity "Reservation System" as ReservationSystem
entity "Book Management" as BookManagement
database "Library Database" as LibraryDB

Member -> ReservationSystem : Search for books
ReservationSystem -> LibraryDB : Query available books
LibraryDB -> ReservationSystem : Return search results
ReservationSystem -> Member : Display available books

loop Reserve Multiple Books
    Member -> ReservationSystem : Select book for reservation
    ReservationSystem -> BookManagement : Check book availability
    BookManagement -> LibraryDB : Query book status
    LibraryDB -> BookManagement : Return book status
    alt If book is available
        BookManagement -> ReservationSystem : Confirm availability
        ReservationSystem -> Member : Display reservation form
        Member -> ReservationSystem : Submit reservation request
        ReservationSystem -> LibraryDB : Update reservation details
        LibraryDB -> ReservationSystem : Confirm reservation update
        ReservationSystem -> Member : Display reservation confirmation
    else If book is not available
        BookManagement -> ReservationSystem : Show not available message
        ReservationSystem -> Member : Display not available message
    end
end

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Member Begins Search**: The library member starts by searching for books they are interested in reserving through the Reservation System interface.

2. **Querying Available Books**: The Reservation System forwards the search query to the Library Database to fetch available books based on the entered criteria.

3. **Displaying Search Results**: The Library Database returns the search results, which the Reservation System then displays to the member.

4. **Reserving Multiple Books**: Assuming the member wants to reserve multiple books, they select each book for reservation one at a time within a loop sequence.

    a. For each selected book, the Reservation System checks the book's availability with the Book Management component.
    
    b. Book Management queries the Library Database for the current status (availability) of the book.
    
    c. Depending on the book's availability status returned by the Library Database, the process diverges:
    
        - **If the book is available**: 
            - Book Management confirms availability to the Reservation System.
            - The Reservation System displays a reservation form to the member.
            - The member submits the reservation request.
            - The Reservation System updates the reservation details in the Library Database.
            - The Library Database confirms the reservation update.
            - The Reservation System finally displays a reservation confirmation to the member.
            
        - **If the book is not available**:
            - Book Management indicates to the Reservation System that the book is not available.
            - The member is informed through a displayed message that the book cannot be reserved at the moment.
    
5. **End of Process**: This loop continues until the library member has completed reserving all the books they are interested in.

This sequence diagram outlines the process flow and interaction between different components for the scenario where a library member wants to reserve more than one book in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

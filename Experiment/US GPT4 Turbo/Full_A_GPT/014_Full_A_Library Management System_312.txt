To illustrate the sequence of operations involved when a library member wants to update an online reservation for books in the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS), a detailed sequence diagram is provided below in PlantUML. This diagram outlines the interactions between the system components like the Web Interface, Reservation Controller, Authentication Service, Database, and Notification Service, to perform the task.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Member as M
participant WebInterface as WI
participant AuthenticationService as AUTH
participant ReservationController as RC
participant Database as DB
participant NotificationService as NS

M -> WI: Request to update reservation
WI -> AUTH: Validate member session
AUTH --> WI: Session valid
WI -> RC: Update reservation request

group Update reservation process
    RC -> DB: Check current reservation details
    DB --> RC: Reservation details
    RC -> RC: Validate update request
    alt Update is valid
        RC -> DB: Process reservation update
        DB --> RC: Update confirmation
        RC -> NS: Send update confirmation notification
        NS --> M: Display notification
    else Update not valid
        RC -> WI: Show error message
        WI --> M: Display error message
    end
end

RC --> WI: Update reservation response
WI --> M: Display update result

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:
1. **Member (Library User) Initiates Request**: The process begins when a library member requests to update a reservation through the Web Interface.
2. **Session Validation**: The Web Interface asks the Authentication Service to validate the member's session to ensure that the request is coming from an authenticated user.
3. **Reservation Update Request**: Once the session is validated, the Web Interface sends the update reservation request to the Reservation Controller.
4. **Checking Current Reservation Details**: The Reservation Controller queries the Database to retrieve the current reservation details.
5. **Validation of Update Request**: The Reservation Controller validates the update request internally. This could involve checking for conflicts, ensuring the requested book is available, and so on.
6. **Decision Making (alt)**:
   a. **If Update is Valid**: The Reservation Controller processes the update by requesting the Database to update the reservation. Upon receiving confirmation, it instructs the Notification Service to send a confirmation notification to the member.
   b. **If Update Not Valid**: The Reservation Controller sends an error message to be displayed to the member through the Web Interface.
7. **Response & Display**: Finally, the Web Interface displays the update result (success or error message) to the member.

This sequence diagram encapsulates the principal interactions and processes involved when a member of the Comprehensive Library Management System attempts to update an online reservation for books.

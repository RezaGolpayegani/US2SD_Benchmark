To accommodate your request for generating a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format for the specified user story, let's break down the interactions step by step:

1. The moderator logs into the Agile Estimation and Planning Tool (AEPT).
2. The moderator creates a new game session.
3. The system generates a unique URL for the game session.
4. The moderator shares the URL with estimators.

Given the user story and the steps mentioned, below is a basic sequence diagram in PlantUML format to illustrate this process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Moderator
participant "AEPT System" as System
participant "Email/Communication Platform" as Email

== Game Session Creation ==
Moderator -> System: Log in
activate System

Moderator -> System: Create new game session
activate System
System -> System: Generate unique game session URL
System --> Moderator: Display generated URL
deactivate System

== Inviting Estimators ==
Moderator -> Email: Share URL with estimators
activate Email
Email -> Estimator: Send URL
deactivate Email

@enduml
```

In this diagram:
- The process begins with the Moderator interacting with the AEPT System to log in.
- Once authenticated, the Moderator requests to create a new game session through the AEPT System.
- The AEPT System, upon receiving the request, generates a unique URL for this game session and provides it back to the Moderator.
- Finally, the Moderator shares this unique URL with the estimators using an Email or any other communication platform (this can be generalized to "Email/Communication Platform" to account for various methods like instant messaging, email, etc.).
- The "Email/Communication Platform" then sends this URL to the estimators, allowing them to access the game session.

Note: The actual implementation might involve more complex interactions, especially concerning security aspects (like authentication and authorization), error handling, and dynamic interaction within the web application. Additionally, modern web development practices might integrate APIs for email sending functionalities or use direct in-app notifications for inviting participants, which could slightly alter the flow represented here.

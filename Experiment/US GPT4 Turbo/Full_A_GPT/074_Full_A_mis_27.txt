Given your request for a PlantUML sequence diagram detailing the process for a Digital Records Archivist managing deposit groups, including adding/removing people, setting deposit window closure dates, and ensuring permissions alignment, here's a comprehensive representation of the interactions:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Archivist as A
participant "Management System" as MS
participant "Database" as DB

A -> MS : Login()
activate MS

MS --> A : Display Dashboard
A -> MS : Navigate to "Manage Deposit Groups"
MS --> A : Display Deposit Group Interface

A -> MS : Select Collection to Modify
MS --> DB : Fetch Collection Details()
activate DB

DB --> MS : Return Collection Details
MS --> A : Display Group Management Options for Collection

A -> MS : Add People to Deposit Group
activate MS

MS -> DB : Update Group Members()
DB --> MS : Confirm Member Addition
MS --> A : Display Updated Group Members

A -> MS : Remove People from Deposit Group
MS -> DB : Update Group Members()
DB --> MS : Confirm Member Removal
MS --> A : Display Updated Group Members

A -> MS : Set Deposit Window Closure Date
MS -> DB : Update Closure Date()
DB --> MS : Confirm Closure Date Update
MS --> A : Display Updated Closure Date

A -> MS : Ensure Default Permissions Conferred
MS -> DB : Update Permissions()
DB --> MS : Confirm Permissions Update
deactivate DB

MS --> A : Display Confirmation & Updated Details

deactivate MS

This PlantUML sequence diagram starts with a Digital Records Archivist logging into the management system and navigating to the deposit group management interface for a specific collection. The sequence then moves through the steps of adding and removing people to/from a deposit group, setting the deposit window closure date, and ensuring that the depositors inherit the collection's default permissions. For each action – adding/removing people, setting the deposit window closure date, and updating permissions – the management system interacts with the database to make the necessary updates and confirms each action back to the archivist.

Please note, this diagram is a simplified representation of the process. The actual implementation could involve more complex interactions based on the specific requirements and existing infrastructure of the Enhanced Digital Repository Management System (EDRMS).

The request involves creating a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the following user story: "As a user, I want to specify the schema of a dataset in a uniform way across all dataset types." Below, I outline the PlantUML code to generate such a sequence diagram, taking into consideration several hypothetical components of the system that would play a role in this process.

This sequence diagram assumes there is a "User Interface" where the user interacts with the system, a "Schema Configuration Service" that processes schema specifications, a "Dataset Management System" that handles dataset operations, and potentially a "Version Control System" that might play a role in versioning the datasets' schemas.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

actor User as U
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Schema Configuration Service" as SCS
participant "Dataset Management System" as DMS
participant "Version Control System" as VCS

U -> UI : Specify Schema
activate UI

UI -> SCS : Send Schema Specification
activate SCS

SCS -> SCS : Validate Schema Specification

alt If Schema is Valid

    SCS -> DMS : Apply Schema Across Datasets
    activate DMS

    loop For Each Dataset Type
        DMS -> DMS : Update Dataset Schema
    end

    DMS --> SCS : Confirmation
    deactivate DMS
    
    SCS -> VCS : Commit New Schema Version
    activate VCS
    VCS --> SCS : Commit ID
    deactivate VCS

    SCS --> UI : Success Response with Commit ID
else If Schema is Invalid
    SCS --> UI : Error Response
end

deactivate SCS
UI --> U : Display Outcome

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **User Action**: The sequence begins with the User specifying a schema through the User Interface (UI).
   
2. **Schema Specification**: The UI forwards this schema specification to the Schema Configuration Service (SCS), where the schema is first validated.

3. **Schema Validation and Application**:
    - If the schema is valid, SCS instructs the Dataset Management System (DMS) to apply this schema across the selected types of datasets.
    - The DMS iterates over each dataset type, updating its schema accordingly.
    - Upon successful schema updates, DMS confirms the completion to SCS.

4. **Version Control Integration**: 
    - With the schema applied, SCS interacts with the Version Control System (VCS) to commit the new version of the schema, ensuring version history is maintained. 
    - VCS returns a commit ID as confirmation.

5. **Outcome Notification**:
    - SCS sends a response back to the UI, indicating success and including the version control commit ID if the operation was successful, or an error message if not.
    - Finally, the UI displays the outcome to the User.

This diagram represents a simplified process flow. The actual implementation details may require adaptations based on specific system architecture, dataset types, and operational constraints.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story "As a researcher, I want to have accurate cross-collection citation information, so that I can find materials again", using PlantUML, you would focus on the interactions between the researcher (user) and the system components involved in generating and retrieving citation information across different collections in the digital archive.

Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram that outlines this process. The diagram encompasses the user's request to find materials using citation information, the system's processing of this request across various digital collections, and the subsequent presentation of accurate citation data to the researcher.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Researcher as researcher
participant "Search Interface" as searchInterface
participant "Database" as database
participant "Citation Generator" as citationGenerator
participant "Collections API" as collectionsAPI
participant "Digital Archive" as digitalArchive

researcher -> searchInterface: Enter search criteria\n(including desired citation info)
activate searchInterface

searchInterface -> database: Query based on criteria
activate database

database -> collectionsAPI: Fetch relevant collections
activate collectionsAPI

collectionsAPI -> digitalArchive: Retrieve detailed collection data
activate digitalArchive

digitalArchive --> collectionsAPI: Return collection data
deactivate digitalArchive

collectionsAPI --> database: Provide aggregated data
deactivate collectionsAPI

database --> searchInterface: Return search results with basic citation info
deactivate database

searchInterface --> researcher: Display search results
researcher -> searchInterface: Select specific item for detailed citation

searchInterface -> citationGenerator: Request detailed citation
activate citationGenerator

citationGenerator -> digitalArchive: Access complete item data
activate digitalArchive

digitalArchive --> citationGenerator: Return item data
deactivate digitalArchive

citationGenerator --> searchInterface: Provide detailed citation info
deactivate citationGenerator

searchInterface --> researcher: Display detailed citation info
deactivate searchInterface

This PlantUML diagram starts with the researcher inputting search criteria, including the desire for citation information, into the search interface. The system then queries the database, which interacts with a Collections API to fetch relevant collections from the digital archive. Once the collections data is retrieved and processed, the search results are displayed to the researcher, including basic citation info. When the researcher selects an item for more detailed citation information, the system utilizes a Citation Generator to access complete item data and provide a detailed citation format to the researcher.

This sequence diagram provides a generalized view of the process, which can be expanded or adjusted based on the specific technologies, protocols, and components involved in the Digital Archive Management Enhancement Project's implementation.

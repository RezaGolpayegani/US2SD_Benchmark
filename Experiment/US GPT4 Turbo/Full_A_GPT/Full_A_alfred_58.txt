Below is a UML sequence diagram example illustrating how ALFRED might handle fall detection and emergency contact notification. This PlantUML code outlines the interactions between the Older Person (user), the ALFRED system, and the emergency contact.

To visualize the sequence diagram, you'll need to use a PlantUML environment or an online tool that supports PlantUML code.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant OlderPerson as user
participant "ALFRED\nDevice" as device
participant "Fall Detection\nModule" as fallDetection
participant "Emergency\nNotification\nService" as emergencyService
participant "Emergency\nContact" as emergencyContact

user -> device : [Wears ALFRED Device]
activate device

device -> fallDetection : Monitor for falls
activate fallDetection

fallDetection -> fallDetection : Detect fall
alt Fall Detected
    fallDetection -> device : Notify of fall
    deactivate fallDetection
    activate device

    device -> emergencyService : Trigger emergency protocol
    activate emergencyService
    
    emergencyService -> emergencyContact : Send emergency notification
    activate emergencyContact
    
    emergencyContact --> emergencyService : Acknowledge receipt
    deactivate emergencyContact
    
    emergencyService --> device : Confirm notification sent
    deactivate emergencyService
    
    device --> user : Notify: "Help is on the way"
    deactivate device
    
else No Fall Detected
    deactivate fallDetection
end

### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

- The diagram starts with the **OlderPerson** (user) wearing the ALFRED device.
- ALFRED continuously monitors the user through its **Fall Detection Module**.
- If a fall is detected:
  - The **Fall Detection Module** informs the ALFRED device.
  - The ALFRED device then activates the **Emergency Notification Service**.
  - The **Emergency Notification Service** sends an emergency notification to the specified **Emergency Contact**.
  - The **Emergency Contact** acknowledges receipt of the notification.
  - A confirmation that the notification has been sent is relayed back to the ALFRED device.
  - The ALFRED device notifies the user that help is on the way.
- If no fall is detected, the system continues monitoring without triggering the emergency protocol.

This sequence diagram illustrates a simplified interaction flow focusing on core components and interactions for fall detection and emergency notification within the ALFRED system.

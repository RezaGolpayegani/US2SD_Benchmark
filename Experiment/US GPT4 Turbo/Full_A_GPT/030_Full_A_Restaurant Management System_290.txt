Given your request, below is a textual representation of a UML sequence diagram for the user story, "As a waiter, I want to enter order details into the system so that I can keep track of what has been ordered." This sequence involves interactions between the Waiter, the Restaurant Management and Operations System (front-end interface), the Backend Server, and the Database.

This PlantUML code describes a sequence where the waiter enters order details that get processed and stored in the system:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain

participant Waiter
participant "Frontend Interface" as Frontend
participant "Backend Server" as Backend
participant "Database" as DB

Waiter -> Frontend : Enter order details
activate Waiter
activate Frontend

Frontend -> Backend : Send order details
activate Backend

Backend -> DB : Store order details
activate DB
DB --> Backend : Order saved confirmation
deactivate DB

Backend --> Frontend : Confirmation order has been saved
deactivate Backend

Frontend --> Waiter : Show success message
deactivate Frontend
deactivate Waiter

@enduml
```

To visualize this, you'll need to use a tool that supports PlantUML code rendering. This sequence starts with the waiter entering the order details into the front-end interface. The order details are then sent to the backend server, which processes and stores the data in the database. Upon successful storage, the database sends a confirmation back to the backend server, which then sends a confirmation to the front-end interface. Finally, the waiter receives a success message indicating that the order has been successfully saved.

This diagram simplifies the process to focus on the core interactions for the user story provided. Depending on the complexity and requirements of the project, you might need to account for additional factors such as error handling, authentication, or more detailed interactions between components.

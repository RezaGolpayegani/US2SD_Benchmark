To create a sequence diagram for the user story - "As a member, I want to see other membersâ€™ comments so I can have book suggestions" - using PlantUML, we will break down the process into several steps to illustrate the interactions between different components in the system. 

This scenario involves the member initiating a request to view comments, the system fetching the requested data from the database, and finally presenting this information to the member. 

Please note, to execute and view the diagram generated from the code below, you might need PlantUML software or access to an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Member
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Application Server" as App
database "Database" as DB

Member -> UI : Request to view comments
UI -> App : Fetch comments
App -> DB : Query comments by books
DB --> App : Return comments data
App --> UI : Display comments
UI --> Member : Show comments and related books

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:

1. **Member -> UI**: The sequence begins with the member (library user) making a request to view comments on books through the library's web interface. This action might involve navigating to a specific section of the website or mobile app dedicated to book discussions or comments.

2. **UI -> App**: The web interface forwards the member's request to the application server. This is where the business logic resides, determining how to fetch the relevant comments from the database.

3. **App -> DB**: The application server sends a query to the database to retrieve comments related to books. This operation might involve complex database lookups to fetch comments, possibly also including details about the books and the members who posted the comments.

4. **DB --> App**: The database processes the query and sends the comments data back to the application server. This data package includes all the necessary information to fulfill the member's request.

5. **App --> UI**: With the comments data retrieved from the database, the application server processes it (if needed) and sends it to the web interface. This step may involve formatting the data for better presentation or filtering based on specific criteria.

6. **UI --> Member**: Finally, the web interface presents the comments and possibly related book suggestions to the member. This could be displayed in a list, grid, or any other format suitable for the application's design and user experience goals.

This diagram gives a high-level representation of the interaction between the user, the library's web interface, the application server, and the database to achieve the user story's goal. Depending on the specific implementation details, additional components or steps might be required.

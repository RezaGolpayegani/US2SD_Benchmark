Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the given user story involves illustrating the process flow when a depositor wants to deposit and maintain datasets through the web interface without needing to install and learn new software. Below is a PlantUML code snippet that represents this interaction:

```plantuml
@startuml
participant "Depositor" as depositor
participant "Web Interface" as webInterface
participant "Backend System" as backend
participant "Database" as database
participant "File Storage" as storage

depositor -> webInterface: Access website
webInterface -> backend: Authenticate user
backend -> database: Verify credentials
database -> backend: Authentication Response
backend -> webInterface: Authentication Status
depositor -> webInterface: Select "Deposit Dataset"
depositor -> webInterface: Fill in dataset details and upload files
webInterface -> backend: Request to deposit dataset
backend -> database: Store metadata
database -> backend: Confirmation of metadata storage
backend -> storage: Upload files
storage -> backend: Confirmation of file upload
backend -> webInterface: Dataset deposit successful
webInterface -> depositor: Show success message

note over depositor,storage: Depositor can manage datasets after deposit

depositor -> webInterface: Request to edit dataset
webInterface -> backend: Fetch dataset details
backend -> database: Query dataset metadata
database -> backend: Return dataset metadata
backend -> webInterface: Display dataset details
depositor -> webInterface: Update dataset details and/or files
webInterface -> backend: Request to update dataset
backend -> database: Update metadata
backend -> storage: Update files (if any)
backend -> webInterface: Dataset update successful
webInterface -> depositor: Show update success message

This sequence diagram starts with the depositor accessing the web interface and follows through the process of depositing a dataset, including authentication, dataset detail submission, and file upload. It also covers the process for a depositor to edit their dataset information after the initial deposit.

To visualize this UML diagram, you'll need to use PlantUML or any tool that supports PlantUML syntax. The diagram illustrates the key steps involved in depositing and maintaining datasets through a simple web interface, as described in the project description and user story.

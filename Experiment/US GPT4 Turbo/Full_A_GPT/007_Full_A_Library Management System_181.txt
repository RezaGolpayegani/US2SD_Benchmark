Below is a PlantUML sequence diagram detailing the process of how a library member sorts and filters search results within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS). This process involves interactions primarily between the User (Library Member), the Web Interface (Client-side application), and the Backend System (Server-side application), potentially also engaging with the Database to retrieve and filter book information based on the user's criteria.

Please note, the diagram assumes a high-level abstraction without delving into specific methodologies for filtering or sorting, as those would require more detailed system specifications and algorithmic considerations.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Library Member" as member
participant "Web Interface" as web
participant "Backend System" as backend
database "Database" as db

member -> web : Enter search criteria
member -> web : Chooses filters & sort options
web -> backend : Send search criteria\nwith filters and sorting
backend -> db : Query books with criteria\nand sort parameters
db --> backend : Return filtered & sorted results
backend --> web : Display search results
web --> member : Show refined book list

Explanation:

1. **Library Member (User)**: Initiates the process by entering their search criteria (like book title, author or category) into the Web Interface (Client-side application). After receiving initial search results, the user then chooses to apply various filters (e.g., publication year, genre) and sorting options (e.g., by popularity, publication date) to refine the search results further.

2. **Web Interface (Client-side application)**: Receives the user's input and sends these criteria, along with the specified filters and sorting parameters, to the Backend System for processing.

3. **Backend System (Server-side application)**: Takes the input from the Web Interface and executes a query against the Database with the specified search criteria, applying the necessary filters and sorting parameters.

4. **Database**: Stores all the information about books, user profiles, and other relevant data. It processes the query from the Backend System, returning the list of books that match the specified criteria, having applied the filters and sorting as requested.

5. **Backend System**: Receives the filtered and sorted list of books from the Database and communicates this information back to the Web Interface.

6. **Web Interface**: Finally, displays the refined list of search results based on the filtering and sorting criteria to the Library Member, enabling them to browse through more tailored search outcomes.

This sequence diagram provides a simplified overview of the process, ensuring flexibility in system design to accommodate varying levels of complexity in search, filtering, and sorting functionalities within the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS).

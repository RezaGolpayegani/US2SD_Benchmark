Below is a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram for the user story provided. The sequence outlines the steps a Cornell faculty member would take to upload data to the repository and associate it with a publication. This sequence also includes interactions with the system to ensure proper attribution for both the data and the publication.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor FacultyMember as "Faculty Member"
participant "Authentication System" as Auth
participant "Repository UI" as UI
participant "Content Management System" as CMS
participant "Database" as DB

== Authentication Phase ==
FacultyMember -> Auth: Access Repository
Auth -> Auth: Validate Credentials
Auth --> FacultyMember: Access Granted

== Data Upload Phase ==
FacultyMember -> UI: Select 'Upload Data'
UI -> CMS: Show Upload Form
FacultyMember -> CMS: Submit Data and Metadata
CMS -> DB: Save Data
DB --> CMS: Confirm Data Saved
CMS --> FacultyMember: Data Upload Successful

== Publication Upload Phase ==
FacultyMember -> UI: Select 'Associate with Publication'
UI -> CMS: Show Publication Form
FacultyMember -> CMS: Submit Publication Details\n(Title, DOI, etc.)
CMS -> DB: Check if Publication Exists
alt Publication Not Found
    DB -> CMS: Prompt to Create New Publication Entry
    FacultyMember -> CMS: Provides Full Publication Details
    CMS -> DB: Create New Publication Entry
else Publication Found
    CMS -> DB: Retrieve Publication Details
end

== Association Phase ==
CMS -> DB: Associate Uploaded Data with Publication
DB --> CMS: Association Successful
CMS --> FacultyMember: Data Successfully Associated with Publication

== Attribution Update ==
CMS -> DB: Update Attribution for Data and Publication
DB --> CMS: Attribution Updated
CMS --> FacultyMember: Confirmation of Attribution

Creating a detailed sequence diagram for the user story: "As a manager, I want to see orders," involves outlining the interactions between components in the Restaurant Management and Operations System when a manager attempts to view orders. Below is an example in PlantUML format, illustrating the sequence of actions in this scenario.

Please note, the PlantUML code does not render directly in this text format. To visualize the sequence diagram, you would need to copy the provided code and use a PlantUML editor or an online tool like the PlantUML Web Server.

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Manager as M
participant "Management Interface" as MI
participant "Back-end Server" as B
participant "Database" as D

M -> MI : Select 'View Orders'
activate MI
MI -> B : GET /orders
activate B
B -> D : Query orders data
activate D
D --> B : Return orders data
deactivate D
B --> MI : Orders data response
deactivate B
MI --> M : Display orders
deactivate MI

@enduml
```

Explanation of the Sequence Diagram Steps:
1. The *Manager* (M) initiates the process by selecting the option to 'View Orders' on the Management Interface (MI).
2. The *Management Interface* sends a request to the *Back-end Server* (B) to get the orders. This is typically done through an HTTP GET request to an endpoint like `/orders`.
3. The *Back-end Server* processes this request and queries the *Database* (D) for the data on orders.
4. The *Database* returns the orders data back to the *Back-end Server*.
5. The *Back-end Server* then sends this data as a response back to the *Management Interface*.
6. Finally, the *Management Interface* displays the orders to the *Manager*.

This diagram represents a simplified version of the sequence of interactions. In a real-world scenario, there might be additional layers of interaction, especially concerning security (e.g., authentication and authorization checks to ensure the manager has the right to view the orders), data processing, and error handling.

To create a detailed sequence diagram for the specified user story--where a staff member wants to specify a unique ID number for each book to track them efficiently--weâ€™ll utilize PlantUML syntax. This sequence diagram will underline the interaction between different components of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) when a staff member decides to assign or update the unique ID of a book.

Please find below a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor StaffMember as Staff
participant "Web Interface" as WebUI
participant "Library Management Server" as Server
database "Library Database" as DB

Staff -> WebUI: Access book management page
activate WebUI

WebUI -> Server: Request book details form
activate Server

Server -> DB: Fetch latest book data
activate DB
DB --> Server: Book data
deactivate DB

Server --> WebUI: Display book details form with data
deactivate Server

WebUI --> Staff: Show book details form
deactivate WebUI

Staff -> WebUI: Enter/Update unique ID for book
activate WebUI

WebUI -> Server: Submit updated book information
activate Server

Server -> DB: Update book record with new unique ID
activate DB
DB --> Server: Confirm record update
deactivate DB

Server --> WebUI: Confirm update success
deactivate Server

WebUI --> Staff: Display update confirmation
deactivate WebUI

In this sequence diagram:

- The flow begins with the `StaffMember` navigating to the book management page of the Comprehensive Library Management System (CLMS) via the `Web Interface`.
- The `Web Interface` requests the book details form from the `Library Management Server`, which in turn fetches the latest book data from the `Library Database`.
- The server processes this data and returns it to the web interface, which then displays the book details form to the staff member.
- The `StaffMember` enters or updates the unique ID for the book in the presented form, and these details are submitted back to the server by the web interface.
- The `Library Management Server` updates the book record with the new unique ID in the `Library Database` and confirms the record update.
- Finally, the web interface displays an update confirmation to the staff member, concluding the process.

This sequence ensures that each book can be precisely identified and tracked by its unique ID, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the library's book management operations.

Given your request, let's create a detailed sequence diagram in PlantUML format, illustrating the user story of a researcher wishing to have a group-level repository for sharing papers, reviews, and comments with other researchers within the Neurohub platform. This diagram will demonstrate the interactions involved in creating, sharing, and commenting on documents in a group repository.

Please note, this is a textual representation of what a PlantUML diagram code would look like for your scenario. To create a visual diagram, you'd need to use PlantUML software or an online PlantUML editor.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant Researcher as researcher
participant "Group Repository" as repo
participant "Document Management System" as dms
participant "Collaboration Service" as collab
participant "Notification Service" as notif

== Share a New Paper ==
researcher -> repo: Access Group Repository
repo -> dms: Verify Access Rights
note right: Checks if researcher\nhas permissions to contribute
dms --> researcher: Access Granted
researcher -> repo: Upload New Paper
repo -> dms: Save Paper
dms --> repo: Confirmation
repo --> researcher: Paper Uploaded Successfully

== Comment on a Paper ==
researcher -> repo: Select Paper
repo -> dms: Fetch Paper Details
dms --> researcher: Display Paper and Comments
researcher -> repo: Submit Comment
repo -> collab: Save Comment
collab --> repo: Confirmation
repo -> notif: Send Notification
notif -> repo: Notification Sent
repo --> researcher: Comment Added & Notification Sent

== Review a Paper ==
researcher -> repo: Select Paper to Review
repo -> dms: Fetch Paper for Review
dms --> researcher: Display Paper
researcher -> repo: Submit Review
repo -> collab: Save Review Details
collab --> repo: Confirmation
repo -> notif: Send Notifications to Authors
note right: Notifies paper's authors\nabout the new review
notif -> repo: Notifications Sent
repo --> researcher: Review Submitted Successfully

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between the researcher and the various components of the Neurohub platform involved in sharing, commenting on, and reviewing papers within a group-level repository. Each interaction sequence illustrates the process from initiating an action (like sharing a new paper), through various service layers (like document management and collaboration services), to the confirmation and notification steps concluding each action.
